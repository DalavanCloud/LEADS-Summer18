ADVERTISEMENT. 

The extension of the scope of the National Museum during the past 
few years, and the activity of the collectors sent out in its interests, 
have caused a great increase in the amount of material in its possession. 
Many of the objects gathered are of a novel and important character, 
and serve to throw a new light upon the study of nature and of man. 

The importance to science of prompt publication of descriptions of 
this material led to the establishment, in 1878, of the present series of 
publications, entitled "Proceedings of the United States National Mu- 
seum," the distinguishing peculiarity of which is that the articles are 
published in signatures as soon as matter sufficient to fill sixteen pages 
has been obtained and printed. The date of publication being plainly 
expressed in each signature, the ready settlement of questions of priority 
is assured. 

The articles in this series consist : First, of papers prepared by the 
scientific corps of the National Museum ; secondly, of papers by others, 
founded upon the collections in the National Museum; and, finally, of 
interesting facts and memoranda from the correspondence of the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

The Bulletins of the National Museum, the publication of which was 
commenced in 1875, consist of elaborate papers (monographs of families 
of animals, &c), while the present series contemplates the prompt pub- 
lication of freshly acquired facts relating to biology, anthropology, and 
geology; descriptions of restricted groups of animals and plants; the 
settlement of particular questions relative to the synonymy of species, 
and the diaries of minor expeditions. 

This series of publications was commenced in 1878, with volume I, 
under the title " Proceedings of the United States National Museum," 
by the authority and at the expense of the Interior Department, and 
under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The present volume, constituting the sixth of the series, has been pre- 
pared under the editorial supervision of Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, curator 
of the department of fishes.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ©IV THE BRACHYURA AND ANOMURA 
DREDGED IN DEEP WATER OFF THE SOUTH COAST OF NEW 
ENGUAND BY THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION IN 1S80, 
1881, AND 1883. 

By SIDNEY I. SMITH. 

This report is intended to be supplementary to my preliminary notice 
of the Crustacea dredged in the same region in 18S0 (these Proceedings, 
iii, pp. 413-452), and to include all the species of Braehyura and Anomura 
obtained off' Martha's Vineyard at depths greater than 50 fathoms. 
The Crustacea dredged off* the mouth of Chesapeake Bay in 1880, and 
off the capes of the Delaware in 1881, will be the subject of a separate 
report, but the specimens from these dredgings are included in the fol- 
lowing lists of specimens examined as far as the species to which they 
belong are contained in the present report. 

A few of the species described as new in the preliminary notice above 
referred to were almost simultaneously described by A. Milne-Edwards 
in one of the reports of the Blake dredgings, under the supervision of 
Alexander Agassiz, in 1877, 1878, 1879 (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cam- 
bridge, vol. viii, No. 1, December 29, 1880), of which I had no knowledge 
whatever until after my paper was printed (January, 1881), and which was 
not published until after my last proof had been returned to the Public 
Printer (December 24, 1880). I have had much difficulty in identifying 
Milne-Edwards's species, but have adopted his names wherever it was 
possible to recognize his species. In determining some of these spe- 
cies I have been greatly aided by the kindness of Prof. Walter Faxon, 
who has sent me for examination some of the type specimens in the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology.* 

The last season's dredging off* Martha's Vineyard reveals the total, 
or almost total, disappearance of several of the larger species of Crus- 
tacea which were exceedingly abundant in the same region in 1880 and 
1881. The most remarkable cases are those of Euprognatka rastellifcra, 
Collocles robustus, Catapagurus Sharreri, Munida Caribccaf Smith, and 

* While the manuscript of this report was in the hands of the printer, the follow- 
ing work of Milne-Edwards was received : Recueil de figures de Crnstace's nouveaus 
ou pen connns. lere livraison. April, 1863. A considerable number of Milne-Ed- 
w.>. V new species are provisionally figured in this work, but it does not seem to 
make ai,; r changes in the proofs of the following pages necessary, except under Anop- 
lonoiw poliiux, which was doubtfully referred to Elasmonotus in the original manu- 
script, but for which the new generic name has been inserted in the proof. — May 29, 
1883.

Pontophilus brevirostris, all of which were exceedingly abundant in 1880 
and 1881 ; but of the first two not a specimen was taken the past season, 
of the Mitnida only a single specimen, and that on the last trip, and of 
the other species only a very few specimens. Lambrus YerrilUi, Acan- 
thocarpus Alexandria LatreiUia elegans, Homola barbata, and Anoplonoius 
politus, which were each taken several times in 1880 and 1881, were 
none of them taken in 1882 j they were far less abundant than the other 
species, however, and the non-occurrence of some of them was very 
likely accidental; but the disappearance of part of them at least was 
undoubtedly due to the same causes which occasioned the disappearance 
of the more abundant species. The disappearance of these species was 
undoubtedly connected directly with the similar disappearance of the 
tile-fish (Lopholatilus) from the same region, and on this account 
specially I give in detail, for many of the species enumerated beyond, 
the tables of specimeus examined from the region explored by the Fish 
Commission; and to these I have usually added tbe specimens which 
I have examined from the collection made by Alexander Agassiz on the 
Blake in 1880. All the species mentioned above as having disappeared 
in 1882 were specially characteristic of the narrow belt of comparatively 
warm water (approximately 50° F.), in from GO to 160 fathoms, which 
has a more southern fauna than the colder waters either side. Professor 
Verrill has suggested (Amer. Jour. Sci., Ill, xxiv, p. 306, 1882) that 
there was a great destruction of life in this belt, caused by a severe 
storm, in the winter of 1881-82, which agitated the bottom-water and 
forced outward the cold water that even in summer occupies the great 
area of shallow sea along the coast, thus causing a sudden lowering of 
the temperature along the warmer belt inhabited by the tile-fish and 
the Crustacea referred to. 

In the following tables of specimens examined the latitude and longi- 
tude, depth, nature of bottom, &c, are copied from the list of dredging 
sfations of the Fish Commission for 1880, 1881, and 1882, in the Bulletin 
of the Fish Commission, vol. ii, pp. 119 to 131, 1882, where further details 
in regard to temperature, &c, are given. In indicating the nature of 
the bottom, the Coast Survey system of abbreviations is used. In the 
column for the number of specimens examined, I is used to indicate large 
specimens ; s. small specimens ; and y, young. When the sexes were 
not counted separately the whole number of specimens examined is 
placed in the middle of the column ; when the sexes were counted sepa- 
rately the number of males is put on the right, the number of females 
on the left, and the number of young in the middle, followed by the letter 
y. As a basis for ascertaining the breeding season, I have, in a great 
number of cases, noted the presence or absence of egg bearing females ; 
when the number of such females was counted it is entered in the ap- 
propriate column ; when specimens carrying eggs were found, but not 
counted, a plus sign, -f, is used; and when none of the specimens ex- 
amined were carrying eggs a zero, 0, is used.

In the original description above referred to it is stated that this 
species resembles Amathia Carpenteri Xorman (Seyramathia Carpenteri 
A. M.-Edwards) ', it is, however, probably not closely allied or even 
congeneric with that species, but apparently closely allied to Amathia 
crassa A. M.-Edwards, and possibly identical with it. I was misled in 
regard to the armament of the carapax of JScyramathia Carpenteri by 
the woodcut given in the Depths of the Sea (no description of the species 
has yet appeared), for Milne-Edwards states that the species is closely 
allied to Scyra umbonata Stimpson, certainly a very different species from 
Amathia Agassizii, and has united them in his new genus Scyramathia. 

As indicated above, all the specimens seen are males. One of these 
is much larger than the larger of the two original specimens described 
and figured in my report above referred to, but differs very little from it, al- 
though the spines of the horizontal series on the branchial region, above 
the bases of the cheliped and first ambulatory leg, are considerably 
longer, and there are two well-developed spines, instead of two or three 
small ones, on the lateral margin back of the anterior angle of the buc- 
cal area. Measurements of this specimen are given in the last column 
of the accompanying table of measurements. The other specimens show 
all gradations between this and the young specimens originally de- 
scribed.

Amathia Tanneri, sp. nov. 

Allied to the last species, but readily distinguished from it by the 
narrower carapax with longer and less diverging rostral horns and fewer 
and more nearly equal spines, and by having a single spine only on the 
base of the antenna. 

Male. — The carapax, excluding the rostral horns and the spines, is 
about as broad as long. The rostral horns are nearly straight, much 
less divergent than in A. Agassizii, and, in the larger of the two speci- 
mens seen, much more than half as long as the rest of the carapax. 
The supraorbital spine and the postorbital process are as in A. Agassizii, 
but the basal segment of the antenna is unarmed except by a single 
spine at the distal end. There are four long and approximately equi- 
distant spines on the mesial line of the carapax, the two anterior on the 
gastric region and smaller than the others, which are on the cardiac 
region, the posterior being near the posterior margin and projecting 
slightly backward over it. There are no prominent spines on the gas- 
tric region except the two median, but there is a minute tubercle or ru- 
dimentary spine either side about equidistant from the two median, and 
on the cardiac region there are no spines or tubercles whatever except 
the two median. There is a single long hepatic and a great branchial 
spine, as in A. Agassizii, but there are no other spines or tubercles on 
the branchial region except two, about as long as the cardiac spines, and 
about equidistant from each other and from the great branchial, the 
posterior gastric, and the anterior cardiac. The anterior angle of the 
buccal area projects in a dentiform process either side, as in A. Agassizii, 
and back of this the prominent margin of the pleural region is armed 
with three small tubercles or rudimentary spines. There are no spines 
or tubercles on the side of the branchial region above the basis of the 
cheliped and first ambulatory leg, and no tubercles whatever on the 
posterolateral margins. 

The chelipeds and ambulatory legs are essentially as in A. Agassizii. 



PKOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 5 

The number and arrangement of the dorsal spines of the carapax 
appear to be nearly as in A. hystrix Stinipson, as figured by A. Milne- 
Edwards (Crust, Kegion Mexicaine, p. 134, pi, 28, fig. 1, 1878), except 
tbat the lateral spines of the gastric region are obsolete in A. Tanneri; 
but all the spines are very greatly longer in hystrix, which appears to be 
a very distinct species.

Hyas coarctatus Leach. 

Taken at a number of stations off Martha's Vineyard, in 8G to 158 
fathoms, and also in much shallower water near Block Island and off 
No Man's Land. Four male specimens were taken off Chesapeake Bay 
in 1880, station 900, N. hit, 37° 19', W. long. 74° 41', 31 fath., sand— 
the farthest south the species has been noticed. 

Collodes robustus, sp. nov. 

Collodes depressus Smith, Proc. National Mus., iii, p. 414, 1681 (non A. M.- 
Edwards. ) 
A careful examination of one of the type specimens of C. depressus 
convinces me that the specimens which I have referred to that species 



6 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

are really a distinct but closely allied and much larger species. Very 
small specimens, 10 m ™ or less in length of carapax, resemble the depresses 
very much, but arc distinguished from Milne-Edwards'* figures and the 
type specimen referred to by the less regularly triangular outline of the 
carapax, the hepatic and branchial regions being much more protuber- 
ant ; by the acute rostral horns, more widely separated at their tips ; by 
the much longer interantennular spine, which is fully as long as in Eu- 
prognatha rastellifera ; by the short and conical or even tuberculiform 
gastric and cardiac spines ; by the spine of the first somite of the abdo- 
men being directed backward instead of upward ; and by the more slender 
choice. 

Male. — In large males over 20 ram in length of carapax, the carapax 
is a little over three-fourths as broad as long, and thickly covered, as 
well as nearly all other parts of the animal except the chela?, with 
strongly curved hairs or seta 1 , which, in every specimen seen, persist- 
ant^ retain a thick coating of soft mud. The rostral horns are slender 
and separated by a rounded sinus, at the bottom of which the inter- 
antennular spine, or true rostrum, which is much longer than the rostral 
horns and grooved longitudinally in front, projects downward and about 
as far forward as the rostral horns. The basal segment of the antenna is 
armed with a lateral and an inferior ridge, each divided into three to five 
short spiniform teeth. The postorbital processes are broad, but acutely 
triangular, and project as far as the tips of the eyes. The dorsal sur- 
face is thickly covered with granular tubercles, and there is a slight 
tubercular elevation, but little more prominent than the tubercles of 
the general surface, on the gastric region, and another on the cardiac, 
in place of the spines in the young. The hepatic regiou is divided 
obliquely near the middle by a deep sulcus into two lobes, of which the 
superior projects in a rounded prominence, which is very conspicuous 
as seen from above, while the inferior is crossed longitudinally by the 
pleurotergal suture and below it armed with a short series of small tuber- 
culiform spines. The branchial regions are prominent, swollen, and 
evenly tuberculated. 

The chelipeds are stout and approximately once and a half as long 
as the carapax; the merus is triquetral with the angles armed more or 
less with tubercles or tuberculiform spines; the whole outer surface of 
the carpus is similarly armed. The chela is approximately two-thirds 
as long as the carapax, naked, smooth, polished, and unarmed, except a 
very few tubercles on the inner surface and near the proximal ends of 
the upper and under edges; the body is nearly as long as the digits, 
thick and swollen; and the digits are compressed, somewhat grooved 
longitudinally, very slightly curved, gaping at the bases, and with the 
prehensile edges slightly and irregularly crenate. The ambulatory legs 
arc hairy to very near the tips, but are otherwise unarmed and smooth 
throughout, and all the segments are subcylmdrical ; the first are about 
two and a half times as long as the carapax, the others successively 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 7 

shorter, and the last considerably less than twice as long as the cara- 
]>ax ; the dactyli are considerably curved, slender, and tapered near 
the acute chitinous tips. 

The sternum is tuberculose, like the dorsal surface of the carapax, 
except upon the concave portion between the bases of the chelipeds, 
where it is smooth. 

The first somite of the abdomen is tuberculose, like the carapax, and 
armed with a low tuberculiform prominence, in place of the spine in the 
young - . The second somite is very short and scarcely wider than the 
first. The third is widest of all, and from it the abdomen is regularly 
narrowed to the seventh somite, which is anchylosed with the sixth, as 
in Euprognatha rastcllifera, triangular, with the ti^> obtuse, and nearly 
as broad as long. 

Female. — The females appear not to attain the adult sexual char- 
acters until the carapax is about 12 mm in length, apparently never 
attain as great size as the males, and as usual resemble the young, 
although they lose the gastric, cardiac, and abdominal spines fully as 
early as the males. The carapax is slightly more convex and the bran- 
chial regions somewhat less swollen than in the male. The chelipeds 
remain small and weak, the chehe slender as in the young, and the am- 
bulatory legs proportionally shorter than in the male. 

The proportions of the carapax, chelipeds, and ambulatory legs in the 
young and adults of both sexes are well shown by the accompanying 
table of measurements. 

Measurements in millimeters and hundredths of length of carapax.

Neither Stimpson nor Milne-Edwards mentions the presence of an in-

speak of it in Euprognatha as specially distinguishing that genus from 
its near allies ; but in the two species which I have examined the spine 
is well developed, though less prominent, and not projecting forward 
at all in C. depressus.

Among the vast number of specimens examined there are very few 
sexually immature individuals. Both sexes ordinarily attain maturity be- 
fore the carapax is G mi " in length, and the scarcity of immature speci- 
mens in the collections may be due to their small size causing them 
to be overlooked in the great mass of material brought up in the trawl. 
The largest females seen do not exceed 10 mm in length of carapax, 
and differ very little from the smallest in the form and proportions 
of chelipeds and ambulatory legs, though the carapax is a little broader 
in proportion and the spines with which it is armed are much lower, or 
reduced to tubercles, in the larger specimens. The males attain much 
greater size than the females, the carapax often exceeding 14 nun in 
length, and there is a very marked and constant increase in the size 
of the chelipeds, particularly in the height and the thickness of the 
body of the chelae, well shown in the accompanying table of measure- 
ments. In both sexes there is considerable variation in the length of 
the spines of the carapax, even in specimens of the same size, and there 
is a marked decrease in the length of the spines with the growth of the 
individual. In large specimens the spines upon the orbital arches, upon 
the gastric, cardiac, and the summits of the branchial regions, and 
upon the basal segment of the abdomen, are usually reduced to low, 
and often inconspicuous, tubercles. 

The number and arrangement of the branchiae and epipods are indi- 
cated in the following formula :
