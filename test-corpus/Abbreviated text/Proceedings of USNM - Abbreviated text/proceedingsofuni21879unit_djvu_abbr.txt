NOTTS 0?i TSBE NESTS ANO 1ECC5.6} OF TDIK Fn«EffT NORTH AMEKICAIV 

SI»ECaE§ OF EITIPIOONAC'ES. 

By T. m. BREWEK. 

Ill the following- paper are given the measurements of all the eggs of 
the eight species of Empidonax that are in iha collections of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, and also those in my own, and also a few others. 
Three of these species, E. mininms, ohscwrus, and hamniondi, so f\ir as 
is known, have eggs that are uniformly of an unspotted white. If ever 
spotted, they are so very rarely and so very slightly as hardly to con- 
stitute really an exception. In another species, flaviventris, of which, 
so tar as I am aware, only five or six well-identified sets have been se- 
cured, at least two well-identified sets have been taken that are entirely 
of an unspotted white color, the others being all more or less spotted 
and marked. All the remaining four species, traiUii, acadicus, jiKsilhis, 
and difficiUii, have eggs strongly marked, though, among them all, eggs 
are occasionally found that are of an unspotted white, or marked with 
very minute spottings. In the following brief mention I chiefly con- 
fine myself to the size of each egg, its locality, and the authority for its 
identification, if the record has been preserved. 
Empidonax hammondi, Baiid. 

Four eggs in Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge (:N"o. 1G81), 
from Blue River, Colo., Edwin Carter, measure .02 x .52; .GO x .54; .02

X .52 ; .05 X .50 ; .08 x .50 ; average .08 x .51. The ground-color of these 
three examples is a creamy white, almost a dead white, and they are 
chiefly spotted around the larger end with markings of a brownish red 
and a few faint spots of lavender. The color of the markings of this set 
has no resendjlance whatever to those of 13440 {U. Jfai'ircntri.s) when 
carefully compared.

Spotted with light-brown markings, on a creamy ground, the markings 
being exclusively around the larger end. 

T. M. B. No. 2900. Santa Cruz, Cal. William A.' Cooper. The female 
parent was shot by Mr. Cooper, and was sent to Washington for identi- 
fication. The nest was in a hollow in a bank, covered with roots and 
bushes. Incubation just begun, May 4, 1878. .09 x .50; .69 x .51; .70 
X .52 ; .69 x .52. These four eggs, as indeed nearly all of the eggs of this 
species that I have ever seen, are conspicuously marked with vivid light 
reddish-broA^Ti spots. In three of this set they are chiefly on the larger 
end ; in one the markings are distributed over the whole egg. Ground- 
color a creamy white. 

T. M. B. No. 2959. Nieasio, Marin County, Cal. C. A. Allen. The 
female parent was shot by Mr. xVllen and identified by Mr. Bidgway. 
.70 X .53 ; .70 x .54 ; .05 x .54 ; .70 x .55. Marked with large bright red- 
brown spots, chiefly about the larger end. This nest was also built in 
a cavity. 

T. M. B. No. 2728. Santa Cruz, Cal. Geo. H. Keady. Sent me as 
JE. jiusillus, but evidently a wrong identification. The nest Avas on a 
horizontal sycamore limb, ten feet from the grouiul. .08 x .55 ; .70 x .57 ; 
.70 X .57 ; .08 x .58.

.70 X .55 ; .70 X .55 ; .60 x .55 ; .08 x .52. The last-mentioned cg<^ is of a 
very nearly unspotted white. 

T. M. B. No. 3053. Santa Cruz, Cal. Geo. II. Beady. April 22, 1877. 
Nest on the lower limb, at the extremity, of a sycamore, ten feet above 
the ground. .00 x .52 ; .05 x .53 ; .07 x .53. These eggs are, with hardly 
a doubt, those of -E7. <7/^c?7/.§, though mistaken by Mr. E. for 2)usillus. 
Their ground-color is pure creamy white. The spots are few, small, and 
of a more than usually faint brown, disposed in rings around the larger 
end, the residue of the eg'^ being unspotted. 

In 24 examples, the greatest length is .76, least .65, average .69 ; great- 
est breadth .59, least .50, average .54.

By the kindness of Mr. II. W. Henshaw I am enabled to give the 
measurements of two sets of eggs taken by him near Honey Lake, Cal., in 
the summer of 1878, June 25. The tirst set of three eggs has an un- 
usually i)inkish tinge to the cream-colored ground, and around the larger 
end is a beautiful wreath of markings of a light lilac-brown blending 
with others of reddish brown. These eggs measure .75 x .55; .74 x .58; 
.78 X .59. 

The other set of four eggs have a nearly jiure Avhite ground, and are 
marked around the wider portion of the egg with small red-brown and 
a few lilac-brown spottings of a rounded shape. The rest of each egg, 
including the larger end, has an unspotted surface. One egg has only a 
very few very fine dottings, and is very nearly pnre white. Their meas- 
nrements are .09 x .55 ; .08 x .54 ; .70 x .55 ; .71 x .58. 

All the eggs of this species have a certain family resemblance, which 
it is easy to recognize at sight, but very difficult to describe distinguish- 
ingly. They are all more or less marked with small, rounded spots, 
rarely blotched, and the markings are, some of them, much more minute 
than is usual in any other species. The spots are also scattered more 
about the entire egg, or, if confined, are chiefly on the larger portion of 
the circumference, and never, or certainly rarely, confluent. 

Mr. Henshaw informs me that he has examined at least twenty-five 
nests of this species {piisiUus), and that with only one exception they 
have all been built in willows. The nest before me, taken by Mr. H. 
near Honey Lake, June 25, 1877, is a well- woven structure, made of thin 
strips of the inner bark of deciduous trees, broken bits of dry grasses, 
lichens, &c., and is lined with fine grasses and hair.^ It is pyramidal in 
shape, tapering to a point at the base, and is 4J in external height and 
31 in external breadth. The cavity is two inches deep. It contained 
the set of four eggs referred to above. 

The exception referred to by ]Mr. Henshaw was a nearly completed 
nest of this species, found June 17, that was placed in a crotch of a 
swinging grape-vine. Its structure is said to have been unusually neat 
and firm for a Flycatcher's. (Wheeler's Eeport, 1870, p. 255.)

Smithsonian No. 13440. St. Stephen, N. B. Geo. A. Boardman. 
Parent secured and identification perfect. The nest is small; had been 
built in a low bush; its breadth internally is 1.90 inches, depth 1.25; 
external diameter 3 inches, depth 1.75. It is cojistructed of Hax-like 
fibres, fine shreds of the inner bark of deciduous trees, a few fine 
grasses mingled with feathers, and lined with horse-hair, downy feathers, 
and tine grasses. The eggs measure .75 x .54; .75 x .53; .70 x .55. 
Their original nundjer was four. They have a ground-color of a pure 
white, with blotch-like spots on the larger end, of purplish drab and 
umber-brown, mixed with scattered black markings, but without a tinge 
of red, and are unlike any other eggs of this genus that I have ever 
seen. 

T. M, B. No. 41G. Centre Harbor, N. H. T. M. B. .70 x .50; .74 x

T. M. B. No. 418. Habfax, N. S. Downes. .09 x M. This egg and 
the two others in this set were of a nearly pure chalky white, with a 
few faint spots, so slight as, at first, to be overlooked. The parent se- 
cured and sent with the eggs. I exclude from this list the set secured 
by me in Grand Menan, referred to below, as, although the identifica- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 5 

tion was apparently satisfactoiy, it was not placed beyond donbt by 
securing the parent. The eggs averaged .68 x .03. Neither in size, 
shape, nor in the shade of ground-color, did they at all resemble any 
fresh eggs of E. minimus that I have ever seen. 

In these ten specimens, the greatest length is .70, the least .07, aver- 
age .73; the greatest breadth is .58, the least .53, average .55. 

Since the above was written, my friend Mr. Wm. A. Jeffries has pro- 
cured for me, through the courtesy of Mr. Deane, the measurements of 
the four eggs procured by the latter in Maine, and described by Mr. 
Purdie. These measure .70 x .55; .70 x .55; .05 x .52; .70 x .55, and re- 
duce the average to .72 x .55. The eggs are described by Mr. Jeffries as 
of pure white ground, with markings in two eggs of line dots; in the 
others, small irregular blotches, of a light red-brown, not so deep or so 
bright as in difficUis; mingled with these are a few markings of lilac. 
The ground-color appears to have lost the rosy tint mentioned by Mr. 
P. in the first description, in which, too, no mention is made of the lilac- 
colored spots. 

Through the kindness of Mr. Osborne I have also been enabled to 
examine one of the eggs contained in the nest of this species found by 
him in Grand Menan. It measures ,70 x .50, and agrees exactly with 
the description given by him, except that there is a slight roseate tinge 
in the white ground. The spots are a light reddish brown, and the egg- 
is undistinguishable from several eggs in my collection of E. difficUis. 
It is very different from the eggs identitied by Mr. Boardman. 

Mr. Osborne writes me that none of this set differ more than yf^ in 
their measurements, and that in their color the only points in which any 
differ from the one described are the lighter shade of the ground-color 
and the larger size of the blotches.

.74; tlie greatest breadth .GO, least .52, average .50. The eggs of this 
species uniformly have a groimd-color of a creamy white, or a deep 
cream-color, and when fresli have a slight roseate tinge. In a few in- 
stances the markings are almost, though never wholly, wanting. The 
eggs of this species so closely resemble those of trailUi as to be indis- 
tinguishable; but they may be readily told from those of j>«A'i7?«s. 

Empidonax minimus, Baiid. 

The ground-color of the eggs of this species, as a general ride, is a 
luiiform unsi)otted white, a creamy white when fresh, fading into a dead 
white when long exposed to the light and air. In one set of two eggs, 
both examples are faintly marked with dark or blackish-brown spots. 
In all the other instances I have seen where eggs of this species seemed 
to be spotted, the markings have had rather the api)earance of stains 
than genuine natural characters.

Mr. S. D. Osborne (B. IST. O. C. iii, 187) describes the nest and eggs 
fonnd in a hnmmock of moss on the island of Grand Menan, the parent 
of which was procnred, and was by him identified as E. Jlaviventris. 
" The cavity extended in about two inches, was abont four inches in 
depth, and was lined with a very few fine grasses, black hair-lilcc roots, 
and skins of berries. The eggs, four in number, are white, with a very 
delicate creamy tint, which differs in its intensity in the different speci- 
mens, and are spotted, mostly at the larger end, with a few dots and 
blotches of a light reddish shade." 

Eight days later than Mr. Osborne's discovery, and in a different 
locality, Messrs. Deane and Purdie secured another nest and set of eggs, 
identified as of the same species, in Houlton, Me. This, too, was "in a 
ball of green moss." " The lining was mainly of fine black rootlets, 
with a few pine needles and grass stems." " The eggs, four in number, 
were perfectly fresh, rounded oval in shape, and of a beautiful rosy- 
white tint, well spotted with a light reddish shade of brown." (B. X. 
O. C. iii, 100.) 

Mr. Osborne remarks that " there are several nests of this bird in 
different collections, the identities of most, if not all, of which are dis- 
puted"; and he adds, "the descriptions given by Baird, Brewer and 
Eidgway, agree very well with the nests of the Traill's Flycatcher," »S:c. 
The first clause is so vague as to make it doubtful to what nests he may 
refer. So far as I am aware, prior to 1878 only four or five nests of this 
bird had been i)rocured, and of these three at least are as well and as 
completely identified as are those of either JMr. O.sborne's or Mr. Pur- 
die's. Their authenticity is as indisputable. 

Mr. Piu'die also assumes, " so great is the variation," " that there was 
some error of identification " ; and finally refers the eggs to the Least 
Flycatcher, and cites Mr. Eidgway as authority. But Mr. Eidgway, on

the coutraiy, accepts tliem as genuine eggs of flavivcntris in bis recent 
report (p. o-44), whatever may be tbeir resemblance to those of E. 
minima ; and he so accepts them stilL* In fact, there is no more reason 
Avhy we should reject the identification of these nests and eggs, than for 
our refusing to credit the statements of Messrs. Osborne, Purdie, and 
Ueaue. In either case the identification was complete, and the differ- 
ences in the nest, if of any real moment, tell as much against the one as 
the other. Mr. Boardman's and Mr. Downes's birds were submitted to 
Prof. Baird, and have had his verification in addition. 

In June, 1850, I met with a nest which I then had no doubt belonged 
to this species. It was in a low bush on Grand Menan, near the water. 
My nephew H. E. Storer, then a lad of sixteen, was with me. Both 
parents were seen, and the male was carefully observed through a good 
glass; the female, when first seen, was on the nest; a male, apparentlj' 
its mate, was near by. Unfortunately, in the attempt to secure one of 
the parents, it was missed, and the birds became so wild that neither 
could be secured. We were obliged to leave the island and to take the 
nest without further identification, but we had no doubt as to the iden- 
tity. The eggs were white, not cream-color, more oblong and hirger 
than the average eggs of E. minima. 

A few weeks later, the same year, I received, among other nests and 
eggs, collected near Halifax by Mr. Andrew Downes, two nests and two 
sets of eggs, with the parent of each, of Jlavivenfris. The parents were 
sent to Prof. Baird, and by him identified as E. flariventris. There 
were no notes as to the position of these nests; they were mere collec- 
tions of broken grasses, and it is not improbable they had been built in 
hollow places. There was, at least, nothing to show to the contrary. 
Their autjienticity there is no reason to question. The following sum- 
mer a nest with three eggs and its parent were taken in Centre Harbor, 
two of the eggs being spotted. The same summer Mr. Boardman pro- 
cured the nest, four eggs, and the parent bird referred to above as now 
in the Smithsonian collection. These eggs do not at all correspond, in 
the color of their markings, to the descriptions gi\'en of the sets found 
in 1S7S. 

Entire reliance cannot be placed upon mere differences in the con- 
struction of nests to prove difference of species. However remarkable 
this may bo, it is anything but conclusive. It will be seen that just 
the same differences are noted in the descriptions of the nesting of 
E. (liffwiUs. While two are noted as built in holes in banks, correspond- 
ing with those of the recent examples of Jfaviventris, others were built 
near the extremities of sycamore limbs ten feet from the ground. Mr. 
J. A. Allen (B. K O. C. iii, p. 25) speaks of the E. acadicm building a 
nuich ruder nest than E. minimus, and most probably the specimens 
before him justified his conclusions ; but my experience would lead me 
to reverse their relative positions. In fiict, both of these species vary 
greatly in their architecture, the Acadian most of all, and no one, but

for liis positive knowledge of tlieir specific identity, could suppose that 
a certain fiat platform-nest of one pair ; the deeply-hollowed nest, with 
its remarkable border of chevaux de fris, of another; and, again, the 
beautiful pensile nest, like a Yireo's, of a third, were all nests of this 
same species acadicus. 

The differences in the color of the eggs identified as those of fari- 
ventris are, i^erhaps, more unusual and remarkable, certainly to their 
extent. Here are two well-identified sets, those from Halifax, of an 
unspotted white ; another set, but slightly spotted ; then Mr. Board- 
man's set, strongly marked, but very differently from the eggs belong- 
ing to the two most recently identified nests. The eggs of hammondi 
and ohscurus are plain white, and no record exists of any spotted ex- 
ample of either. The same is almost equally true of yninimHS. In sixty- 
one eggs, only two are found with even faint spots; but this exception 
may show the possibility of there being more variations than we are 
now aware of. Among the eggs of difficilis a single specimen occurs of 
very nearly unspotted white. The same is true of one egg of E. jnmllus. 
Among the eggs of E. traillU unspotted eggs are comparatively more 
common. Among my eggs of E. acadicus there is also one very nearly 
an unspotted white. So that these variations in nests and m color 
of eggs cannot be received as necessarily conclusive as against such 
positive identifications as those of Mr. Boardman's and Mr. Downes's 
examples. 

If we take the product of the average length multiplied by its aver- 
age breadth at the point of the largest diameter as a proximate test 
of the relative size of the eggs of each species, we find the following 
result : 

Acadicus 4144 

Obscurus 4015 

Traillii 3096 

riaviventris 3900 

Pusillus 3930 

Difficilis 3720 

Hammondi 3328 

Minimus - 3200 

Since the above was in type, Mr. Charles A. Allen of ^^icasio, Cali- 
fornia, has furnished me with some very interesting and apposite notes 
on the nidification of Enipidonax difficilis, demoniiinxtiug the remarkable 
variations that may exist in regard to the position and structure of the 
nests of one and the same species of biixls. After mentioning that he 
has taken and identified some forty or fifty nests of this species, he adds: 
'' I find E. difficilis breeding in all situations. Sometimes I find them 
on the curled root of a tree on the banks of a stream or brook, not over 
six inches above the water; again I find them in the jagged end of some 
half-submerged log in mid-stream; again within the loose V»ark of a 
tree, no matter what kind, nine or more feet up; again I find them in a

cavity in some decayed tree or limb, or in any kind of depression that 
gives a base to begin to work on. I also find them in out-honses, or 
bnildings removed from dwellings, on the rafters, or on any spot where 
they can stick their nest. They are also very common under bridges, 
and I have found fonr built in the forks of small trees, some four or live 
feet up. These were all the same veritable E. diffici-Us.^^ 



A JLIST OF EIROIPEAN FISHES HIV THE COI.IL.EC TBON OF THE 

l\^ITEl> STATES NATIOi^'AL JTirSElTlTI. 

By TARI.ETOIV H. BEAN. 

About 350 nominal species are mentioned. Since the list is intended 
simply to facilitate the exchanges between tlie United States National 
Museum and uuiseums iu Europe, no attempt has been made to distrib- 
ute the names in accordance with the latest knowledge concerning the 
classiflcatiou and specific identity of the species iu question. The names 
given to them by those who presented them are, with few exceptions, 
retained. 

One species {Gasferosfeus Blancliardi, Sauvage), which was described 
from specimens sent to Paris fiom Boston, United States, is referred to 
Gasierosteus imngiiius^ Linn. ( := Fygostciis occidcnfaliSj (C & V.) Breevort), 
with which it is identical. 

The numbers at the left are those of the National Museum Catalogiie; 
those at the right were attached to the fishes when they were received.
