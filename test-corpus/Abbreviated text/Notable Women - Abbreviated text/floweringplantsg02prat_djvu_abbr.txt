THE FLOWERING PLANTS 

OF 

GREAT BRITAIN 



Order XXVII. ONAGRARI^— WILLOW-HERB TRIBE. 

Calyx of 4, sometimes 2 lobes, which in the bud are attached to each 
other by their edges ; calyx-tube more or less united to the ovary ; petals as 
many as the lobes of the calyx, twisted while in bud, falling eai'ly ; stamens 
4 or 8, rarely 2 ; ovary of 2 or 4 cells, often crowned by a disk ; style 
slender ; stigma knobbed, or 4-lobed ; fruit a berry, or 4-celled capsule. 
This order consists chiefly of herbaceous plants, rarely shrubs, found mostly 
in the temperate parts of the world. None of the plants contain unwhole- 
some properties, but they contribute little either to medicinal or domestic 
purposes, though some of the species add largely to the beauty of our 
gardens. Several of our most common and ornamental flowers are included 
in it, as the Fuchsias, Clarkias, and Evening Primroses. 

1. Willow-herb {Epilohium). — Calyx 4-parted, the lobes not combined 
after expansion ; petals 4 ; stamens 8, 4 long and 4 short ; capsule long, 
4-sided, 4-celled, 4-valved ; seeds numerous, tufted with long down. Name 
from the Greek e])i, upon, and lohos, a pod ; the flowers being placed at the 
top of a seed vessel, shaped somewhat like a pod. 

2. Evening Primrose ((EiwtMra). — Calyx 4-parted, the lobes more or 
less combined after expansion, and bent back ; stamens 8 ; capsule 4-celled, 
4-valved ; seeds numerous, not bearded. Name in Greek signifying " catch- 
ing the flavour of wine." 

3. IsNARDiA. — Calyx 4-parted ; petals 4, or none ; stamens 4 ; capsule in- 
versely egg-shaped, 4-angled, 4-celled, 4-valved, crowned with the calyx. 
Named after Antoine dlsnard, a French botanist. 

4. Enchanter's Nightshade {Circcm). — Calyx 2-parted ; petals 2 ; 
stamens 2 ; capsule 2-cellcd, each cell containing a seed. Name from Circe, 
the enchantress. 

1. Willow-herb {EpiUbium). 

* Petals unequal in size ; stamens lent down. 

1. Rose Bay, or Flowering Willow {E. angnstifdlium). — Leaves 
scattered, lanceolate, veined, smooth ; flowers somewhat spiked. Plant

perennial. A variety of this plant occurs very commonly in gardens, having 
larger flowers and shorter capsules, which is sometimes called E. brachy- 
carjyum ; this is occasionally found as an escape from gardens. This Willow- 
herb is a rare plant in moist woods in England, though less so in Scotland. 
Some botanists have thought it to be not truly wild, but it has long estab- 
lished itself, and, in some woods, as in those about Wrington, in Somerset- 
shire, whole acres of ground are covered with it ; and it occurs in many parts 
of North Wales. It does not seem to have been common in Gerarde's time, 
for he mentions one place only where it might be found. "It groweth," he 
says, " in Yorkshire, in a place called the Hooke, neere unto a close, called 
the Cow-pasture, from whence I had these plants, which doe grow in my 
garden, very goodly to behold, for the decking up of houses and gardens." 
The old herbalist describes it as a " goodly and stately plant, having leaves 
like the greatest willow, or ozier. The branches," he says, " come out of the 
ground in great number, growing to the height of sixe foote, garnished with 
brave flowers of greate beautie, consisting of fower leaves apiece, of an orient 
purple colour." The variety so common in gardens, often, by its profusion 
there, occasions much trouble to the gardener, not so much by the seed 
which it produces, as the roots which creep to a great distance, and take a 
very firm hold of the soil ; and if by chance the common form of the plant 
is introduced, as it often is, instead of the variety, it is far worse, as this 
l)ears seeds in abundance, and as each seed has a little silky feather attached 
to it, it wafts itself away over garden and shrubbery during August and 
September, and comes up in profusion in the following April. This plant, 
is from four to six feet in height, bearing showy rose-purple flowers in 
August ; its stem and flower-stalk are much tinged with lilac. It is 
called by gardeners French Willow, and in France one of its common names 
is Laurier de St. Anioine, after St. Anthony, the first founder of monastic 
institutions. 

Rare as this plant is on the English landscape, yet in some countries 
towards the north of Europe, it, by its profusion and bright colour, gives 
during its season a characteristic feature to the landscape. The border of 
the lake near Tornea is described as beautified during summer with large 
masses of this plant, which towers over the brink of the water, displaying 
everywhere the most gaudy garlands, even on spots where vegetation in 
general seems dwarfed and barren. In Kamtschatka, this and other 
Efilohiums are exceedingly abundant, and mingle with most showy and 
brilliant species of groundsel (Senecio), to beautify large tracts of land. Both 
plants contribute greatly to the physiognomy of the landscape, for the 
groundsel plants, as tall as a man, and laden with flowers, frequently cover 
the meadows with a fine yellow colour ; while a splendid red tint is given 
to wood-sides and rivers by the Willow-herb. 

Both the English and scientific names of this genus are very appropriate. 
Several of the larger species, before coming into flower, closely resemble the 
rods of a willow in the first year of their growth, only that they are 
herbaceous instead of woody. The name Epilohium describes with much 
accuracy the position of the petals : epi, on, lohos, the long pod-like seed- 
vessel, which at first sight might be taken for a flower-stalk. It is quad-

rangulai^ in form, opening hy four valves, and if when ripe it be carefully 
opened on one side, the seeds with their silky appendages burst from their 
prison. 

This and some other of the species are well fitted for planting in 
shrubberies, as they are uninjured by the shade and frequent dripping of 
trees, and they thrive well in city gardens, unhurt by smoke. The leaves 
and stems of the Bay Willow afford a decoction, which is said to cause 
intoxication, and it is added to the fermented drink which the Kamtschatdales 
procure from the cow-parsnip. The pith has, when dried, a sweet flavour, 
and both ale and vinegar are commonly made from it in the north of Europe ; 
while the young shoots both of this and some other species are, when 
dressed, a good and wholesome substitute for asparagus. Gloats are said to 
be very fond of the plant, and both cows and sheep will eat it. The wool of 
the seeds, mixed with fur or down, has been manufactured into stockings, 
and into some kind of fabric intended for dresses, but this was too fragile to 
be of much use. The French call the Willow-herb, L'Epilohe a Spi and Osier 
Fleiiri, and the Germans, Der- JFeiderich. Its name among the Tartars is 
Karamuk, and the Russians term it Xipree. 

* * Flowers regular ; stamens and styles erect ; stigmas i-cleft. 

2. Great Hairy ^Villow-herb {E. hirsutum). — Leaves partly clasping 

the stem, narrow, oblong, serrated, downy ; stem downy, much branched ; 

root creeping. Plant perennial. Our stream-sides, beautiful as they ever 

are with their rich verdure and. many flowers, receive an additional ornament 

when, during July and August, this Willow-herb grows there in profusion, 

Most of the rills which trickle among our green meadows, and the streams 

and rivers which wind their silvery way, as well as the stagnant ditches, can 

then boast this ornament in more or less abundance. Often the purple 

blossom waving at a distance, on a hot summer's day, invites the wanderer 

to some cool sequestered spot, where he may feel as Chaucer did in such a 

scene : — 

"And the river which that I sate upon, 
It maden siche a noise as it ron, 
Accordant with the birdis arniony, 
Methoiight it was the best melody 
That mighten bin y' hearde of any man." 

The stems of this Willow-herb are much branched, so that the plant has 
somewhat the appearance of a shrub. The foliage, like most downy foliage, 
is of a greyish-green tint, and the large blossoms are reddish-purple. They 
have a very pleasant odour, like that of cooked fruit, hence a common 
country name for the flower is "codlins and cream." It never grows on a 
dry soil, but on river-brinks, and the sides of ditches. 

3. Small-flowered Hairy ^Villow-herb (F. parvifl&rum). — Leaves 
sessile, lance-shaped, downy, and toothed ; stem nearly unbranched, generally 
downy, but sometimes smooth. Plant perennial. This species has flowers 
of less size than the last, and is altogether a smaller plant ; it is easily dis- 
tinguished from it by its stem being branched only at the upper part ; its 
stolons, too, afford a marked character, as they are not nearly so fleshy. It 

1—2 



^ ONAGPvARI^ 

grows usually to a height of between a foot and three feet, and has, in July 
and August, flowers of a purplish-red colour. It is very common on moist 

lands. 

4. Spear-leaved Willow-herb (E. lameoUfum).— Leaves stalked, lance- 
shapcd, irregularly toothed ; stem obtusely angled ; stigma slightly lobed ; 
root fibrous and perennial. This rare species has been found near Tmtern, 
Monmouthshire, in the neighbourhood of Bristol, and in various places 
ranging from Surrey to Cornwall. The flowers, though small, are numerous, 
of S pale rosy tint, and appearing from July to October. It is fond of 
rather stony ground, especially Avhen accompanied by moisture. 

5. Broad Smooth-leaved Willow-herb {JE. mmtanum).— Leaves 
egg-shaped, acute, smooth, toothed, rounded at the base, the lower ones 
shortly stalked ; stem slender, rounded, sometimes slightly downy. Plant 
perennial. This species grows commonly on dry places, as on shady hills 
and banks, and is often to be seen on the cottage-roof. It is a small and 
unattractive plant, its flowers being rarely fully expanded. They are of a 
purplish rose-colour, and of small size, though slightly larger than these of 
the next species. They are produced in June and July. 

* * * Floimrs regular ; stamens erect ; stigma clubbed, not i-cleft. 

6. Pale Smooth-leaved Willow-herb (E.rdseum). — Leaves on stalks, 
smooth, egg-shaped, finely toothed ; stem erect, imperfectly 4-angled ; stigma 
undivided, or slightly lobed. Plant perennial. This Willow-herb is local, 
occurring more frequently in the south than in the north, near water, or in 
hedges and copses. It has very small rose-coloured flowers in July and August. 

7. Square-stalked Willow-herb {E. tetragdmm). — Leaves lance- 
shaped, sessile, and slightly toothed ; stem with two, three, or four angles ; 
stigma undivided. The small rose-coloured flowers of this species appear in 
July and August, and are not conspicuous, though the plant Avould, after 
flowering, attract attention by its long pod- like seed-vessels. Its stems are 
nearly smooth, and it is distinguished from the last species both by the more 
distinct angles of the stem, and by its narrower leaves without stalks. It is 
a very common plant in wet places ; its stem is about one or two feet high, 
and it is in flower during June and July. The most common form of this 
produces its stolons in summer, and they have the leaves in scattered, 
opposite pairs ; this form is also known as E. obscunm. The less frequent 
typical form has autumnal stolons, with leaves forming a rosette. 

8. Narrow-leaved Marsh Willow-herb {E. palustre). — Leaves 
narrowly lance-shaped, entire, or toothed ; stem rounded, erect, and nearly 
smooth ; flower-buds nodding ; root-stock with thread-like scions, which pro- 
duce scaly buds in autumn. Perennial. This species has minute rose-coloured 
flowers in July and August. Its stem is from sixteen to eighteen inches high, 
and has often two downy lines on opposite sides. It grows in bogs, and 
near ditches and pools. 

9. Chickweed-leaved Willow-herb (E. ahinifolium). — Leaves egg- 
shaped and pointed, very thin, smooth, and nearly sessile, the upper ones 
toothed, the lower entire ; stem round. Plant perennial. This is a moun- 



WILLOW-IIEEB TRIBE 5 

tainous plant, frequent on moist places of Scottish mountains, and in Durham 
and Westmoreland, having a few purplish-red flowers a third of an inch 
across ; these appear in July. Its stem throws out slender suckers, with 
here and there a leaf upon them. It may be known at a glance from the 
other species, by its thin, flagging foliage. 

10. Alpine Willow-herb {E. alpinum). — Leaves oval and blunt, on 
short foot-stalks, nearly entire ; stems somewhat smooth. Plant perennial. 
This, too, is a plant of mountainous regions, where it grows by rills. It is 
common on all the Highland mountains, and extends south as far as 
Durham and Cumberland. In July it has two or three flowers, which droop 
while in bud, and are of bright purplish-red. It is a plant of much lower 
growth than any other species, the stem being much less than a foot in 
height. 

2. Evening Primrose (CEnotMra). 

Common Evening Primrose (ffi". hUnnis). — Leaves lance-shaped, 
somewhat egg-shaped, toothed ; stem slightly hairy ; flowers large, sessile ; 
stamens about the length of the corolla ; capsules nearly cylindrical. Plant 
biennial. This pretty flower must be considered rather as naturalized than 
truly wild in this kingdom, neither is it at all a frequent ornament of our 
country scenery. On a few spots of sandy soil near Liverpool, on some of 
Sussex, and in many parts of Warwickshire, it gi'ows and thrives far from 
the care of man. It is not mentioned by our earliest writers on plants ; but 
Parkinson, who calls it the Tree Primrose of Virginia, names it in his 
"Garden of Pleasant Flowers," which was published in 1629. It is known 
to have been first sent from Virginia to Padua, in 1619, and probably found 
its Avay into England at about the same period. It is a frequent garden 
flower, opening its large primrose-coloured and somewhat fragrant blossoms 
about seven in the evening, just when the summer twilight is on its way. 
Its mode of expanding is very curious. The petals are held together at the 
summit by the attached tips of the calyx. The segments of this flower-cup 
at first separate at the base, and the yellow petals may be seen peeping 
through these openings, a long time before the flower is fully blown. The 
expansion is very gradual till the blossom is freed from the confinement of 
the calyx-tips ; but Avhen this is efl"ected, it unfolds very quickly for a minute 
or two, and then stops ; after which it opens very gradually, spreading itself 
out quite flat. The whole of this process sometimes occupies half an hour, 
and in some instances a little sudden noise is made as it jerks the topmost 
hooks asunder. The flowers hang next day in a discoloured and flaccid 
condition on the stem, and this circumstance renders the plant less attractive, 
as usually it has little beauty till evening. It sometimes, however, varies 
from its ordinary habits, and a blossom or two may occasionally be seen fully 
open even at noonday. The French call the Evening Primrose L'Onagre; 
and it is the Nachfkerze of the Germans, and the Tweejaarige of the Dutch. 
The Hungarians call it Viola. It was formerly termed Onagra, the "ass 
food," by botanists ; and its name was changed to a word signifying wine- 
trap, because the roots have l)een used as incentives to wine-drinking, and 
were formerly eaten after dinner, as olives are at the present day. The roots, 



6 ONAGRAPJ^ 

as well as those of several other species of Ginotliera, contain much nutriment, 
and the root-stock is almost as good as the potato. Perhaps we owe some 
of the wild plants which occur on our landscape to the former cultivation of 
the flower for the sake of these root-stocks, which were once much valued, 
and which would probably have retained their place at the modern table, 
had not the potato become so general and accessible. They still, in some 
countries, form a common article of food. 

The Evening Primrose grows to the height of two or three feet, beginning 
to flower about July. The uppermost blossoms expand first, and there is a 
constant succession of pale yellow flowers, till the end of autumn. Many of 
the garden species are much larger and handsomer than this. (Enothera is 
qviite an American genus, all but one (Tasmanian) member of this family 
having been brought from the New World. 

3. ISNARDIA. 

Marsh Isnardia (/. pah'istris). — Leaves opposite, egg-shaped, acute, 
and stalked ; stem procumbent, rooting, and smooth ; flowers solitary and 
axillary ; capsule 4-angled. Plant annual. This little herb has stems about 
six or eight inches long, and flowers which have pistils and stamens, but 
which are destitute of petals. It is very rare, having been found in a pool 
at Buxstead, in Sussex, and on Petersfield Heath, in Surrey, where it occurred 
in abundance. It also grows near Brockenhurst, in Hampshire, and in Jersey. 
It was formerly recorded as a British plant, but was again lost in this king- 
dom, though known as a plant of various parts of Europe and America, as 
far south as Mexico. Mr. Borrer, in 1827, rediscovered it in Sussex. Some 
authors call it Ltidwigia palustris. 

4, Enchanter's Nightshade {Circcea). 

1. Common Enchanter's Nightshade {C. lutetidna). — Leaves egg- 
shaped, tapering to a point, toothed ; bracts none ; stem erect, downy ; calyx 
hairy ; root perennial. This is a very common plant in lanes where the 
thick bushes or high trees cast a deep shadow, and in shi'ubberies, woods, 
and gardens. The stem is about a foot or a foot and a half high ; and the 
dark green leaves, somewhat heart-shaped at the base, are very large in pro- 
portion to the blossoms. It is very troublesome in damp gardens, on account 
of its strong creeping roots ; and the two-petalled flowers are too small to 
render the plant ornamental in any situation. They appear in June and 
July, are white or pale rose-colour, with pink stamens, and are destitute of 
odour. 

The genus Circcea, though named after the enchantress Circe, does not 
appear ever to have been used in enchantments, and it has no active properties 
either of a useful or deleterious kind. Some writers think that the name 
was given because many of the dark shady nooks in which it grows are such 
places as would be chosen for incantations by the pretender to magic, in 
order that their gloom might affect the imagination of his victims. Boerhaave 
ingeniously suggested that the fruit, which is clothed with hooked bristles, 
laying hold of unwary passengers, and clinging to them, might, to him who

named the plant, have been suggestive of the practices of the fabled Circe, 
who di'ew the unguarded into her toils ; but neither notion seems probable, 
and the origin of the name is involved in mystery. The French call the 
plant La Circie ; the Germans, Das Hexenkraut ; the Dutch term it Stevens- 
krnid. The ancient Greeks had a plant which they called Circcea. Our 
common plant is one much used by the leaf -cutter bees in the construction 
of their cells. Everyone observant of garden flowers must have seen how 
often little semicircular pieces are neatly cut out of the leaves of the garden 
roses ; and the leaves of several wild flowers are subject to the same depreda- 
tions. The perennial mercury, three species of willow, the sweet briar and 
dog rose, the barren strawberry, and our Enchanter's Nightshade, a^e 
among the wild plants chiefly selected ; while, in the garden, the Provence, 
Frankfort, and monthly roses are sought by these insects, that they may 
hang their cells with the green tapestry taken from the foliage. Baxter tells 
us that the caterpillar of the elephant hawk-moth [Chmrocampa elpeno)-), which 
feeds chiefly on the water bed-straw (Galium palusfre), sometimes regales 
itself also on the Enchanter's Nightshade. 

2. Alpine Enchanter's Nightshade (C alpina). — Leaves heart- 
shaped, toothed, nearly smooth ; stem ascending, nearly smooth. Root 
perennial. This species much resembles the last, but is smaller, and less 
branched. It is found in woods, thickets, and stony places, especially near 
the lakes in the north of England and Scotland. Its flowers occur in 
July and August. Its leaves are remarkable for their thin and delicate 
texture. Some botanists describe a third species as C. intermedia, which in 
some specimens appears to be a variety of the first of the species, in others of 
the last. 



Order XXVIII. HALORAGE^E— MARE'S-TAIL TRIBE. 

Calyx tube adhering to the ovary, and either expanding into three or 
four minute lobes, or forming simply a rim; petalo either minute, and 
placed at the mouth of the calyx, or wanting ; stamens either equallino- the 
petals in number, or twice as many, or, when petals are wanting, one or 
two in number ; ovary with one or more cells ; stigmas equal in number to 
the cells of the ovary ; capsule not opening ; seeds solitary, pendulous. 
The order consists of herbaceous plants of little beauty, and possessing no 
important properties. In several species the stamens and pistils are in separate 
flowers. 

1. Mare's-TAIL (Hipp uris).— Calyx forming a minute, indistinctly 2-lobed 
rim to the ovary ; petals ; stamen 1 ; style 1 ; seed 1, nut-like. Name in 
Greek signifying a horse's tail. 

2. Water Milfoil {Myriopliyllum). — Stamens and pistils in separate 
flowers, but on the same plant ; calyx 4-parted ; petals 2 or 4 ; stamens 2 to 8 ; 
styles 4 ; fruit of 4 nut-like seeds. Name from the Greek myrios, ten thou- 
sand, and phyllon, a leaf, from its numerous leaves. 

3. Water Starwort (C'a/////w-/ie).— Flowers without calyx or petals, often 
with 2 bracts at their base ; stamen 1 ; anther 1-celled; styles 2 ; ovaries 2, 



8 HALOEAGE^ 

each 2-lobed; fruit of four 1 -seeded carpels. Name in Greek signifying 
beautiful hair, from the hair-like roots. 

1. Mare's-tail {Ilippuris). 

Common Mare's-tail {H. vulgaris). — Leaves linear andwhorled; stem 
erect, jointed, without branches. Plant perennial. This singular plant would 
not fail to attract notice when abundant, as it often is in ponds and ditches. 
It grows frequently also on the borders of slow streams, especially such as have 
a gravelly base. It is tall and slender, rising ten or twelve inches above the 
water, and very well deserving its common French name of Pin d'ecm, or the 
no less expressive German one of Schaftholm. The flowers are inconspicuous, 
small and green, appearing in May and June close to the stem, in the angles 
which it forms with the short whorled leaves. This is remarkable as being 
one of the simplest of herbaceous plants, sometimes having a mere rim for its 
calyx, having no petals, and but one stamen, one pistil, and one seed. When 
the plant has flowered it sinks down and dies, and its stems and leaves form 
a mass at the bottom of the water. 

Like many another aquatic plant, the Mare's-tail has its uses, not alone 
to water animals, as the freshwater snails and insects, not only to the wild 
ducks and water-fowls which hail it as a welcome repast, but also to man. 
It renders the neighbourhood of stagnant water less prejudicial to human 
health, by absorbing a great quantity of noxious gas, thus serving to purify 
an atmosphere rendered putrid by the exhalations of the pool. In deep 
water it attains considerable luxuriance, and is sometimes three feet in height. 

There is no other plant with which the Mare's-tail could possibly be con- 
founded, save some of the horse-tails, those allies of the ferns, and many of 
which abound in moist places. It is, however, essentially distinct, for the 
horse-tails have no flowers, and bear their fructification in cones or catkins at 
the tops of their stems or branches. Their leaves, too, are longer and more 
rigid, those of this herb being short and clear, with a thick strong vein running 
up the centre. The Dutch call this plant Kattestail, and the Italians term it 
Ippuride. 

2. Water Milfoil {Myriophjlhm). 

1. Whorled Water Milfoil {M. verticilldhim). — Flowers all whorled, 
having bracts at their base, cut into slender segments, and longer than the 
flowers. Plant perennial. This aquatic can boast no brightness of corolla, its 
greenish petals being too small to attract observation. It is, however, very 
pretty in its greenness, and in the graceful form and movement of its feathery 
leaf -like bracts, which lie like green threads in the water, and are swept down- 
wards if perchance a wind stirs up a current in the still pool. The plant well 
merits its name of Myriad-leaf, as well as its German name of Fenderhall. 
The French call it Volant d'eau, and the Dutch Federkruid. The Milfoil is 
common in many of the pools and ditches of Europe ; and this species is 
frequent in such places throughout England and Wales. Mr. Backhouse 
found a Milfoil growing with some of the pond-weeds (Potamogefon) in the 
waters of New South Wales, and believed it to be identical with the English 
species.

MARE'S-TAIL TRIBE 9 

2. Spiked Water Milfoil (Tlf. spicdfum).- — Flowers wliorled, longer than 
the ISracts at their base, which form an interrupted leafless spike ; stem slender 
and branched. Plant perennial. This is a common plant in standing pools, 
where it forms entangling masses by its slender stem and branches, which, 
when we take them from the water and shake them, drop numerons little 
living creatures, that have evidently found a home amid the leaves and bracts. 
The whole plant looks very green and pretty, as it lies in the water, where it 
floats below the surface, save when in July and August its spikes of minute 
greenish flowers rise just above the pool. These spikes are from three to five 
inches long, and the leaves, which are four in a whorl, are cut into slender 
segments. 

3. Alternate-flowered Milfoil (i/. alter niflomm). — Barren flowers 
arranged alternately on a short leafless spike ; fertile flowers about three 
together, in the axils of the leaves at its base ; spikes drooping when in bud. 
Plant perennial. This rare species occurs in a few places in England and 
Scotland in ponds and ditches, its small green flowers appearing from May to 
August. It is very similar to the last species, but is more slender, and its 
flowers are less abundant. 

3. Water Starwort {CalUtrkhe). 

1. Vernal Water Starwort (C vSrna). — Leaves in pairs, united at the 
base ; flowers in the axils of the leaves, usually containing one stamen or one 
pistil only, but occasionally both organs ; carpels bhintly keeled at the back. 
Plant annual. This little Starwort is abundant in ditches, pools, and slow 
streams, everywhere, and is often probably mistaken by those little familiar 
with plants, for some species of bedstraw {Galium). Its shoots are most 
truly starry, the leaves being crowded on the top of the slender stem, and 
often the plant when in masses forms thick tufts like green cushions in the 
pools lying among the grass of marshy lands. The verdure is of emerald 
hue, and numerous little white hair-like shining roots proceed from the joints 
of the stem, forming a characteristic feature of the Starwort. The foliage is 
submersed, but the stamens of the little green flowers in June and July rise 
just above the surface of the water. The Starwort is called by the French La 
Callitric, and by the Germans Wassersten. It is the Callifrica of the Italians, 
and the Sterrekruid of the Dutch. Several varieties or sub-species are described, 
one having the lobes of the fruit slightly keeled, another with the lobes 
slightly winged at the back. 

2. Pedunculated Water Starwort (6*. pedimaddta). — Fruit-stalks 
without bracts at the base ; fruit 4-sided, each lobe bluntly keeled at the 
back. Plant annual. This rare species is very nearly allied to the last, of 
which it is probably a sub-species. It is found in ditches in Sussex, and some 
other English counties, as well as in Wales, producing its inconspicuous flowers 
somcAvhat earlier than 0. verna. 

3. Autumnal Water Starwort (6'. aidumndlis). — Fruit-stalks very 
short, without bracts ; fruit somewhat 4-sided, each lobe winged at the back. 
Plant annual. This species occurs about London, in various lakes from 
Scotland to Devonshire, and in Ireland. It flowers in June and July. A 
variety known as C. truncata is distinguished by having its fruit keeled.

10 CERATOPHYLLE^— HORN WORT TRIBE 

Order XXIX. CERATOPHYLLE.E— HORNWORT TRIBE. 

* 

Stamens and pistils in separate flowers, but on the same plant; calyx many 
parted; corolla none ; stamens 12 — 20, without filaments ; anthers 2-pointed; 
ovary 1 -celled ; style curved ; seed-vessel nut-like, 1 -seeded, not opening. 
This is an aquatic order, containing only the genus Hornwort, which is very 
distinct from any other known plant. The affinities of this order have been 
much disputed by botanists. 

Hornwort (Cerafophyllum). — Characters those of the order. Name in 
Greek signifying horn-leaved. 

Hornwort (Ceratophyllum). 

1. Common Hornwort (C. denu'rsam). — Fruit armed with two thorns 
near the base, and terminated by the curved style. Plant perennial. Our 
illustration will remind all accustomed to roam in the country of a plant 
which they often see lying in slow streams and ditches. This Hornwort 
grows quite under the water, and being unlike most other plants in the cone- 
like form which its mass of crowded leaves often assumes, it will hardly fail 
to be noticed, though no bright corolla adds grace to its verdure. The 
whorled leaves, rigid as bristles, are two or three times forked, and somewhat 
serrated ; they are often also inflated and jointed. The green flowers grow 
in whorls in the axils of the leaves. The plant has no known uses, except 
that it aids with other aquatic vegetation in purifying the water, by absorb- 
ing carbonic acid and giving off oxygen. Some varieties of this plant have, 
by various botanists, been described as species ; in one, the spines of the 
fruit are long, rigid, and rounded ; in a second, they are also long but 
flattened, and winged at the base ; a third variety has no spines on its fruit, 
but two tubercles at its base. The first of these is most common in this 
country. 

2. Unarmed Hornwort (C snbmersum). — Fruit without either spines 
or tubercles, and ending with the very short styles. Plant perennial. This 
species much resembles the last, and can be known from it only by the 
character of its fruit. It is rare, being found only in the pools and ditches 
of the south of England, its flowers appearing in June and July. It is prob- 
ably only a sub-species of C. demersum. 



Order XXX. LYTHRARIvE— LOOSESTRIFE TRIBE. 

Calyx of one piece, often tubular, 3 to 6-parted, sometimes with inter- 
mediate teeth ; petals inserted between the outer divisions of the calyx, soon 
falling off; stamens springing from the tube of the calyx, within the petals, 
and either equalling them in number, or twice, thrice, or four times as many ; 
ovary 2 to 6-celled ; style single ; capsule many-seeded, covered by the calyx, 
but not united to it. This order consists chiefly of herbaceous plants, having 
mostly four-sided stems, and opposite leaves. Many of the species are 
astringent, and several are used by dyers. The celebrated Henna or Al 
hanneh of the Arabs is furnished by a plant of this order, the Lawsonia alba. 
The paste made of its pounded leaves is used by the Egyptians, Arabs, and
