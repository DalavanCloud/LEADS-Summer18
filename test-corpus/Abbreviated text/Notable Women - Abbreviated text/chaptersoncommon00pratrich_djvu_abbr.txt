THE main object of this little book is to 
enable the reader, unacquainted with Natural 
History, to recognise some of the different 
objects frequent on our shores. There is not 
one of them all, but has some interesting cir- 
cumstance connected with it, familiar enough 
to the man of science, but never suspected by 
those who have not had opportunity or incli- 
nation to study them. Could we trace the 
mental history of our great naturalists, we 
should find that many who have devoted their 
lives to the pursuits of science, had at first 
their attention directed to it, like Linnaeus, by 
listening to a conversation, or, like Sir Joseph 
Banks, by musing, in a leisure moment, on 
the beauty of a flower ; and thus the reading 
of a little volume like this, on Common Things, 
may serve to awaken an interest in nature, 
which shall not sleep again.

vi PREFACE. 

In so small a book little reference could be 
made to any system of classification; and though 
the alphabet of science is as important as the 
alphabet of literature to any who would make 
progress in it, yet the use of scientific terms 
would here be out of place. Perchance the 
reader may be led to investigate more fully the 
subjects here presented; and this book will 
have well accomplished its design, if it should 
create a desire to study the works of our great 
naturalists, of Dr. Harvey, or Dr. Johnston, 
of Professor Forbes, or Rymer Jones, or other 
writers here so often referred to; or if it 
should send him into the wide fields of nature 
to observe and discover for himself. 

But should time and place be wanting to 
pursue the subject farther, yet will he have 
gained something, if he have learned aught of 
common things. " Partial knowledge," says 
an Arabian proverb, " is better than total igno- 
rance. He who cannot acquire all that he 
would, should be careful to get all that he 
can."

SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 



CHAPTER I. 

" For there, by sea-dews nursed and airs marine, 
The Chelidonium blows in glaucous green ; 
Each refluent tide the thorn'd Eryngium laves, 
And its pale leaves seem tinctured by the waves ; 
And half-way up the cliff, whose rugged brow 
Hangs o'er the ever-toiling surge below, 
Springs the light Tamarisk ; the summit bare 
Is tufted by the Statice ; and there, 
Crush'd by the fisher, as he stands to mark 
Some distant signal or approaching bark, 
The Saltwort's starry stalks are tliickly sown, 
Like humble worth, unheeded and unknown." 

IT is delightful on some fine summer's morning 
to wake up to the loud continuous sounds of the 
waves, and to stray along the shore, with eye and 
heart alive to the natural beauty of this world. 
When the calm airs seem, as the poet describes 
them, 

" Like Music slumbering on its instrument,*' 

they are to the listener both sweet and soothing, 
and serve we know not how nor why to awaken 
memories of the past, and so to identify themselves 
with our own being, that scenes far away, and 
long absent friends, gradually mingle in the day- 
dreams begotten by their tones. 



2 SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 

The glorious ocean ! Can we wonder that lin- 
gering groups gather daily close by its boundaries, 
gazing hour after hour upon the silver waves? 
Call them not idlers. They may have come from 
scenes of busy toil for needful repose ; and while 
listening to sweet sounds, and looking on lovely 
objects, they are getting treasures of memory for 
other days, and store of health and strength for 
future duty. 

What thoughtful person ever listened to the 
ocean's murmurs without thinking aver what a 
mass of contents its waters roll : 

" Bones of dead men, that made 
A hidden Golgotha where they had fall'n, 
Unseen, unsepulchred, but not unwept 
By lover, friend, relation far away, 
Long waiting their return to home and country, 
And going down into their fathers' graves, 
With their grey hairs or youthful locks, in sorrow, 
To meet no more till seas give up their dead ; 
Some, too, ay, thousands, whom no living moum'd, 
None miss'd, waifs in the universe, the last 
Lorn links of kindred chains for ever sunder'd." 

We have often thought, on looking on the mul- 
titudes of invalids who with their companions 
crowd our shores in summer, that they would 
possess a great advantage if they had some out- 
door pursuit with which to beguile the time. Dr. 
Cullen used to say, that he had cured weak 
stomachs by engaging his patients in the study of 
botany, and particularly in the investigation of 
wild plants ; and many a head-ache, and a heart- 
ache too, would be relieved if its owner could be 
brought to feel an interest in the shells or sea- 
weeds which are strewed on the beach, or in the 
sweet wild blossom which smiles on the side of 



SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 3 

the cKff. But the time spent at the sea-side is 
not usually the time for study. Rest of mind is 
often absolutely necessary for health ; and even 
where this is not the case, yet the many hours 
spent in the open air, while invigorating to the 
frame, render us indisposed to any continued 
mental exertion. It is those already in some 
degree acquainted with natural history who can 
now enjoy its results. There are few, however, 
who, while for a period they are residents on our 
coasts, would not Ibe glad to know some of its 
familiar objects, if tire knowledge could be ob- 
tained without study ; and it is for the unlearned 
in these matters that these pages are written. 

It will be necessary to confine our remarks on 
the plants of our shores to such as grow only by 
the sea-side, or to such as grow more frequently 
there than elsewhere. The flowers which cluster 
in some of the meadows at a little distance, and 
many which spring up on the cliffs, thrive equally 
well on inland soils of the same nature. The rich 
clumps of the wild rock rose (Helianthemum 
vulgare) are as bright on the chalky cliff which 
skirts the green lane, as on those that lie about 
the sea; and, find them where we may, have so 
bright . a golden tint, that we remember how 
Pliny told of them, that the kings and wise men 
of Persia anointed themselves with them, to make 
them fair and beautiful, and called them the 
" beauties of the sun." Then there is the wild 
thyme ( Thymus serpyllum), sending its sweetness 
from among the short grass on the eliff, or on 
the air of the heathland; and the pale chocolate 
blossoms of the wild marjoram ( Origanum vulgare), 
which the Greeks termed the " joy of the moun-

tain ; " and the pretty little euphrasy, or eye- 
bright (Euphrasia officinalis), which grows equally 
well on the pasture land far away from the sea, 
and which in the Greek language signified " de- 
light;" and many another, with old names so 
expressive, and so pretty withal, that we are re- 
minded of the words said to be spoken by Mary 
Powell, before she married John Milton, that 
" Adam might have named the animals, but that 
Eve surely named the flowers." 

Notwithstanding considerable variety in the 
aspect of different parts of our coast, yet every 
one must have remarked the general barrenness 
of vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the sea. 
Such trees as are planted near the shore, have 
usually a stunted appearance, and have their upper 
boughs bent down by the strong winds which 
blow over them. The sycamore is the only tree 
which can be said to flourish close to the sea as 
well as on inland spots, and to lift as bold a front 
and as full a canopy to the sea breeze, as to the 
wind of the sheltered valley ; and the tamarisk 
and the tree mallow are almost the only shrubs 
which seem to prefer the saline soil for their 
growth. The presence of a large quantity of salt 
in the soil, has, from the earliest ages of the 
world, been known to produce sterility ; and not 
only do the early Greek and Roman writers name 
the practice of sowing a field with salt when they 
condemned it to barrenness, but we have an 
instance of this named in the Scriptures, when 
Abimelech in his fury beat down the city of 
Shechem, and sowed its site with salt, that never- 
more the earth should yield her produce to gladden 
the heart of man. The Psalmist, speaking of 



SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 5 

some once beautiful country, says, " He turneth 
the land into barrenness," literally, "into salt- 
ness;" and the scanty herbage and the small 
number of trees and flowers usually found on the 
vast saline deserts of Africa, or the sandy regions 
of the countries of the East, are proofs at once of 
the injury done to vegetation by salt. On some 
lands of Cheshire, even of late years, when a soil 
has produced too abundantly the rushes and weeds 
which trouble the agriculturist, he has laid rock 
salt upon the earth to destroy them. 

But it is only lands very near the sea whose 
produce is injuriously affected either by the 
muriates of the atmosphere which have passed 
over it, or by the saltness existing in the earth. 
A portion of salt is favourable to the growth of 
plants, and the supply of moisture derived from 
so large a body of water renders the land at a 
small distance more fertile than those parts of the 
earth's surface which are further from the coast. 
Every one at all acquainted with the southern 
part, especially, of our island, can call to mind 
some quiet nooks of sunshine in which the wild 
flowers attain great size and beauty, and crowd 
the hedgebank or meadow, only just screened by 
a cliff from the rudest breezes of the sea. What 
Keats said of the Isle of Wight, might equally 
well apply to some parts of the coast of Devon- 
shire : " I have found," said the invalid poet, 
" several delightful wood alleys, and copses, and 
quiet freshes ; as for primroses, the isle ought to 
be called Primrose Island that is, if the nation 
of cowslips agree thereto, of which there are divers 
clans just beginning to lift up their heads," 

But, barren as the soil is close to the sea, yet it 



6 SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 

has its own peculiar plants ; plants winch will 
grow nowhere else saline plants, which, if carried 
away to grace some inland garden, droop and 
pine for their native shore. Others grow not 
only by the sea-side, .but on pasture lands to 
which saline waters have access ; and some which 
grow in our inland fields, yet are so much more 
luxuriant near the shore, that we must consider 
that as at least an especial place of their growth. 
So small, however, is the number of wild plants 
of the sea-side, that limited as is this little volume, 
they can be enumerated in the chapter appro- 
priated to them. 

There are few subjects more interesting to the 
botanist than the adaptation of plants to their 
peculiar places of growth. The most lofty Alpine 
hills have their blossoms, and the deep blue 
gentian thrives amid the snows, 

" The living flower that skirts the eternal frost ; " 

the sand has its sand- worts, which refuse to grow 
on richer soils. The magnificent cedar is wild 
on its native Lebanon only; Lapland boasts her 
flower called Charles's Sceptre, which is never 
seen beyond the limits of her own land. Even 
the dreary Siberia has her own beautiful Cypri- 
pedium, or, as we in English term it, the ladies' 
slipper. Our streams have their water-lilies, our 
meadows their field flowers, our woods their 
anemones and hyacinths. At the extreme limits 
of vegetation we find the wood sorrel, ferns, 
lichens, and mosses cover the grey rocks ; one 
lichen growing even on the forbidding surface of 
the stalactite. There are plants which are indi- 
genous to sulphureous springs, and a little flower 



SEA-SIDE PLANTS. ? 

grows in luxuriance on the refuse of the lead mine. 
The sea itself has on its bed immense tribes of 
marine vegetation, the food and home of its living 
creatures ; and where but in the sound of its 
waves shall we find that bright flower of our sand 
and shingle, the yellow horned poppy ? 

There are some features in our wild saline 
plants which, while they are not invariable or 
peculiar to them, yet are very general. They are 
usually very succulent, and their stems and foliage 
have on them more or less of a sea-green powder, 
a kind of pale green or whitish bloom. Leaves 
or stems covered with this are termed by botanists 
glaucous, and a very familiar instance of glaucous 
foliage may be seen in the outer leaves of the 
common cabbage. The succulent nature of sea- 
side plants renders them suitable for soik which 
yield little nourishment ; for succulent plants have 
many pores, by means of which they readily im- 
bibe moisture, which is long retained in their juices, 
and which, deriving as they do from rains or dews, 
renders them less dependent on nutriment to be 
obtained from the root. The common houseleek 
and stonecrop of our house-tops are nourished far 
more by the atmosphere than by the soil ; and so 
are the aloe and the fig marigold, and the ice-plant 
of desert lands, many of which are like the plants 
of our sea-side, too, in the glaucous nature of their 
green. 

One of our sea-side plants, the Samphire ( Crith- 
mum maritimum), is known, at least by name, to 
most persons. Several of our early poets have 
alluded to it, and its frequent use as a pickle ren- 
ders it familiar to many. Not one of our native 
plants can yield so good, and warm, and aromatic 



8 SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 

a flavour for a pickle as this ; arid it has been a 
favourite with good housewives for many years ; 
for an old song of Heywood's, enumerating the 
cries of London in his time, has this line, 

" I ha' rock samphier, rock samphier." 

The inhabitants of places whose rocks abound 
with this plant use it not only as a pickle, but also 
as an ingredient in salads ; and they also eat it as 
a culinary vegetable. It is sometimes grown in 
gardens and pots, and it appears under certain 
circumstances to thrive well. Thus Braddick, the 
horticulturist, who cultivated the samphire in 
Thames Ditton, on a sheltered and dry spot, well 
screened from the morning sun, and who sprinkled 
the soil where it grew with powdered barilla, 
remarks of it, "This I do to furnish the plant with 
a supply of soda, since, in its native place of growth, 
it possesses the power of decomposing sea-water, 
from which it takes the fossil alkali, and rejects the 
muriatic acid." This horticulturist also protected 
it from the cold of winter, and he found that by 
this mode of treatment the plants flourished most 
plentifully, and produced a large supply of leaves 
and shoots, which were cut twice in the season. 

The stem of the samphire is about a foot high, 
round and leafy ; and it has dense clusters of 
greenish-white flowers. The whole plant is fleshy 
and glaucous, with a salt aromatic flavour. It 
grows on several rocky shores of our southern 
coast, but it is not common in the north of Eng- 
land. It is very rare on the rocks of Scotland; 
and Sir William Hooker remarks of it, " It is 
found only, I believe, on the coast of Galloway, 
and thence northward to Colzean Castle, Ayrshire 



SEA-SIDE PLANTS. 9 

(whence I have received numerous specimens), 
and at Aberlady, Haddingtonshire." He adds, 
that when the process of drying this plant for the 
Herbarium is aided by immersion in hot water, 
a number of opaque white dots make their appear- 
ance on the surface. 

The samphire is always found on rocks or stone 
walls beyond the reach of the tide. The chalk 
hills of Dovor, which gave its old name to that 
ancient town, the Dwyr of the Saxons, from their 
" Dwfyrrha," a "steep place," have long been 
celebrated for the growth of samphire. Michael 
Drayton refers to it in his Poly-Olbion : 

" Some, his ill-season'd mouth that rightly understood, 
Bob Dover's neighbouring cleeves of samphyre, to excite 
His dull and sickly taste, and stir up appetite." 

And the very name of the Shakspeare Cliff was 
derived from its connexion with the passage in 
which the great dramatist refers to this plant. 
That cliff has recently suffered from the long- 
continued action of rain and sunshine upon it ; 
but as long as it exists, the samphire will probably 
continue to thrive there. We must quote again 
the oft-quoted lines on this subject, and which, 
indeed, well describe the scene from the summit 
of the cliff: 

" How fearful, 

And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low ! 
The crows and choughs that wing the mid-way air 
Show scarce so gross as beetles ; halfway down 
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade ; 
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head ; 
The fishermen that walk upon the beach 
Appear like mice, and yon tall anchoring bark 
Diminish'd to her cock, her cock a buoy, 
Almost too small for sight : the murm'ring surge, 
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes, 



10 SEA-SIDE PLANTS, 

Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more, 
Lest ray brain turn, and the deficient sight 
Topple down headlong." 

This trade of samphire gathering from the cliff 
has indeed proved a dangerous one. A few years 
since, a man, resident in Dovor, and who had for 
many summers gathered the plant for sale in the 
neighbourhood, was suspended, as usual, by a rope 
attached to a pole at the summit. The rope, on 
this occasion, suddenly gave way, and the un- 
fortunate man was precipitated to the base of the 
cliff, and expired immediately. 

The word Samphire is a corruption of St. Pierre, 
the plant having, in former times, been dedicated 
to the memory of the Apostle ; and it was also 
familiarly called St Peter's Herb. It had, besides, 
the name of Crest Marine. The monks, as we well 
know, gave the names of the wild plants known 
to them, according to the times when they came 
into blossom, making them the remembrancers of 
their saints' days and festivals. Upwards of three 
hundred plants., now in use., and recorded in our 
works of medical botany, under different names, 
were known in years long passed away in the 
monasteries, as the medicinal herbs used by the 
religious orders. A writer in Bees's Encyclo- 
paedia says that we ought to pronounce and spell 
the name of this plant sampire, our modern ortho- 
graphy and pronunciation being a corruption of 
this. But our quotations from the old writers 
serve to show that various modes of spelling the 
word were used in past times ; nor indeed need we 
wonder at this, when even in the days of Queen 
Elizabeth a man would spell his own name half a 
dozen ways if it could possibly bear such a variety
