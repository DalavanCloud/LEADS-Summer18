PREFACE 



The principal source of the fine series of Jurassic plants 
from the Yorkshire Coast, now preserved in the British 
Museum, was the collection of the late Mr. William Bean, 
of Scarborough, acquired by purchase in 1859. Only 
a portion of this collection, however, is in the British 
Museum, the remainder being in the Yorkshire Philo- 
sophical Society's Museum at York. 

Mr. Bean was an enthusiastic collector, and by means 
of his vast store of duplicate fossil plants he was able to 
make exchanges with many foreign museums. Specimens 
bearing labels in his well-known handwriting also exist 
in museums and private collections all over Britain. 

A former resident of Scarborough, Dr. Murray, also gave 
many specimens to the British Museum in the early days, 
from Gristhorpe Bay and elsewhere along the Yorkshire 
coast. 

The plant-bearing Oolitic shales of Yorkshire are much 
more friable than those of the Coal-measures. This may 
possibly explain the difficulty experienced in some instances 
in identifying 'types,' many of the specimens having been 
broken up and their parts separated, or even destroyed, by 
time and frequent removals. 

The Oolitic plant-remains of Yorkshire are of peculiar 
interest, many of them having been carefully studied by

accomplished a botanist as Mr. A. C. Seward has now 
undertaken to Catalogue the Collection in the Geological 
Department which has remained for so long a time without 
a historian.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 



Specimens of Jurassic plants from Gristhorpe Bay and 
other famous localities on the Yorksliire coast are met 
with in nearly every Museum in Britain, as well as in 
several continental collections. I have endeavoured to 
supplement the data afforded by the specimens in the 
British Museum by examining collections in other places : 
frequent allusion will be found in the descriptive part of 
this Catalogue to important types in provincial or continental 
museums. The Museums of Cambridge, Oxford, York, 
Scarborough, Whitb}', Manchester, Newcastle, and Leeds 
are rich in Yorkshire Coast plants, and good collections 
have been examined also in Paris, Stockholm, Lund, and 
elsewhere. The British Museum series and the Leckenby 
Collection in the Geological Museum, Cambridge, are 
probably the richest in large and well-preserved specimens, 
but the other museums, especially those of Scarborough, 
Whitby, York, and Manchester, contain much material of 
considerable value. The identification of type-specimens 
has often been a difficult task : some of the specimens 
are probably lost ; many have suffered considerably, partly 
through insufficient care having been exercised in their 
preservation and, to some extent, as the result of the 
natural breaking up of the shale in which the fossils 
occur. My search for type-specimens, which has often been 



VIU AUTHOR S PREFACK. 

fruitless, has afforded a practical demonstration of the 

need of some system for the centralization and cataloguing 

of all specimens, which have served for the diagnosis or 

illustration of new species. 

I desire to convey my hearty thanks to those in charge 

of the museums I have visited for their kindness in affording 

me every facility in the examination of collections, and for 

their willingness to assist my work in various ways. Among 

continental friends who have aided me I wish to express 

ray gratitude to Professor Nathorst, who generously placed 

at my disposal some unpublished drawings of specimens 

collected by himself ; also to Dr. Renault and Professor 

Zeiller, of Paris, who enabled me to obtain access to the 

Jurassic plants under their charge. 

My thanks are due to Miss Woodward for the care with 

which she has executed the drawings published in this 

volume ; to my wife I am also indebted for some of the 

drawings reproduced in the text, which were made from 

specimens in the museums of Whitby, Scarborough, and 

York. The photograph reproduced in Text-figure 34 was 

kindly taken for me by Mr. Gepp, of the Botanical 

Department. 

The Councils of the Royal Society and the Literary and 

Philosophical Society of Manchester have allowed me to 

borrow process-blocks originally used in their publications, 

and the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press 

generously gave me permission to use several blocks in 

their possession.

ENGLAND. 



The Jurassic plant-bearing strata exposed in the cliff Bections 
of the Yorkshire coast, between Whitby and a few miles south 
of Scarborough, have afforded unusually rich data towards a 
restoration of the characteristics and composition of a certain 
facies of Mesozoic vegetation. The abundance of specimens in 
European museums and the descriptions of several British species in 
the works of Brongniart, Sternberg, Zigno, and other Continental 
palaeobotanists, bear testimony to the wealth of material obtained 
from these Inferior Oolite rocks. The following passage from the 
first volume of Schimper's Traits de paUontologie vegetale illustrates 
the importance, which this eminent palaeobotanist attached to the 
investigation of the English Jurassic flora: — " On ne saurait assez 
recommander aux paleontologistes anglais I'etude approfondie de la 
flore fossUe de I'oolithe de Yorkshire. C'est une des flores les 
plus interessantes, a cause de sa grande ressemblance avec la flore 
de la formation rhetique et du lias inferieur et 4 cause de son 
rapport avec la flore cretacee. Les descriptions et les figures que 
nous en possedons sont insuffisantes pour arriver 4 une delimitation 
rigoui-euse des genres et des especes. Aussi ai-je du passer sous 
silence un certain nombre de ces demieres faute de donnees exactes." * 
In the present volume an attempt is made to describe in detail 
the several elements composing the Jurassic flora of East Yorkshire, 
and to furnish a general sketch of the geographical distribution 
and botanical affinities of the vegetation represented by the Lower 
Oolite plants of this area.

Historical Sketch. 



We may begin ^ this brief historical survey of our knowledge 
of the Jurassic plants of Yorkshire with a reference to the well- 
known memoir by Young & Bird — A Geological Survey of the 
Yorkshire Coast,^ published at Whitby in 1822. Mr. John Bird 
was Curator of the Whitby Museum, and the Rev. G. Young 
acted as one of the Secretaries of the Whitby Literary and 
Philosophical Society. The first part of this work deals with the 
geological structure of the strata which are described under various 
heads, such as the upper shales, oolitic limestone, second shale, 
ironstone and sandstone, blue limestone, sandstone, shale and 
coal, and Dogger; but most of these descriptive terms have not 
been adhered to by later geologists. In the second part a brief 
description is attempted of the organic remains, a few fossil plants 
being represented by crude coloured drawings ; the type-specimens 
are preserved in the Whitby Museum, and a recent examination 
of the collection enabled me to identify most of the originals of 
Bird's figures. The second edition of the Geological Survey 
of the Yorkshire Coast, which appeared in 1828, contains various 
additional drawings of fossil plants.^ The plants are compared 
with several recent genera such as Asplenium, Scolopendrium, 
Mippuris, Cynaria, Gnaphalium, and others, or they are merely 
spoken of as fragments of ferns or leaves. Reference is made to 
the figures of Young & Bird in the description of several species 
dealt with in the following pages. 

It has been truly said that " Young & Bird's work did much 
to arouse the desire for geological pursuits, which eventually led 
to the establishment of the Museums at Whitby and Scarborough, 
and to the formation of such collections of fossils as were made 
by Bean, Williamson, and others." * The enthusiasm of these and 
other local naturalists resulted in the accumulation of rich col- 
lections, and, indeed, nearly the whole of the material at present

literature vide also Phillips (75), Fox-Strangways (88), etc.

available for the study of the fossil flora of East Yorkshire Tvas 
obtained by their means. It is to be regretted that very little 
serious collecting has been undertaken during the last half-century ; 
some of the famous localities which afforded so rich a harvest sixty 
or seventy years ago are probably almost worked out, but there is 
undoubtedly much valuable material to be found if local enthusiasm 
were again aroused. William Bean and his nephew John Williamson 
rendered excellent service in the early days of the geological 
exploration of the Yorkshire coast : the characteristic handwriting 
of the former is met with in most of oui" Museums on the labels 
of Yorkshire fossil plants ; the latter began life as a gardener at 
Scarborough,' and afterwards became Curator of the Scarborough 
Museum, which owes many of its treasures to his skill as a scientific 
collector. John Williamson in later life was assisted in his natural- 
history work by his son William Crawford Williamson, whose 
brilliant palaeobotanical researches date from his boyish days, when 
his father's zeal led him to take a share in interpreting the 
records of Jurassic life. The elder Williamson was acquainted 
with William Smith, whose name will always be prominently 
associated with Jurassic geology,- and with Smith's nephew, John 
Phillips, whose work on the Yorkshire Coast is one of the English 
classics. Adolphe Brongniart ' was at this period engaged on his 
famous work on the history of fossil plants, and as the recognized 
authority received various Yorkshire specimens for identification, 
some of which he figured and described. 

The following list includes the East Yorkshire species described 
by Brongniart in 1828 : —

Phillips' Illustrations of the Geology of Yorkshire was publisbed 
in 1829, dedicated by an " affectionate nephew and grateful pupil " 
to "William Smith. Phillips' book marked an important advance 
on that of Young & Bird, and placed the geology of East 
Yorkshire on a sound scientific basis ; he included the plant- 
bearing strata in the "Bath Oolite formation," the term Oolite 
having been first applied to these rocks by Smith. The strata 
are classified by Phillips as follows: — 

r Combrasti limestone. 

I Upper sandstone, shale and coal, with plants, 
Bath Oolite \ Impure limestone. 

I Lower sandstone, shale and coal, with plants. 
V Ferruginous beds — Dogger Series. 

In the first edition of Phillips' work the respective positions of 
the grey limestone and millepore bed are confused, so that the 
Gristhorpe plant - bed,^ which is now included in the middle 
estuarine series, was placed in the upper division.^ This mistake was 
first pointed out by the late Professor Williamson,^ and corrected 
in the later edition of Phillips' book. Phillips speaks of the fossil 



1 John "Williamson is usually credited with the discovery of the famous 
Gristhorpe plant-bed. In a letter written to Lindley in 1832, William Bean 
asserts that he was "the first discoverer" of this bed. (I am indebted to 
Professor Lebour for an opportunity of reading Bean's letter.)

plants as belonging chiefly to "the natural monocotvledonous 
Orders, Filices, Lycopodiaceae, Equisetaceae, and Cycadaceae," with 
associated fragments of dicotyledonous species. The plant-bearing 
sediments he describes as principally such as might be deposited by 
rivers varying in force, and subject to intervals of feebler action. 
The drawings of the plants are in many cases far from accurate, 
and it is not an easy matter to recognize the original specimens. 
Some of Phillips' type-specimens appear to have been lost, but 
others have been identified in the York Museum and elsewhere. 
In 1875 a third and much enlarged edition of Phillips' memoir was 
published under the editorship of Mr. Robert Etheridge. Professor 
Phillips did not live to see the publication of the third edition of 
his work ; the concluding paragraph of the preface, written in 
1874, the year of his death, is worthy of repetition.' 

" The Yorkshire coast has ever been my delight : to sketch 
its romantic promontories, to climb and measure its cliffs, to 
investigate its numerous fossils and its rich variety of marine life, 
may be recommended to every lover of natural beauty and to eveiy 
student of natural history. To them I bequeath what has been to 
me a labour of love, a life-long enjoyment — the study of the great 
Mesozoic section here so plainly cut, — not doubting that kindly 
thoughts will accompany the corrections and additions which time 
has brought, and still must bring, to the work which I now consign 
to their use." 

The following list includes the species enumerated in the last 
edition, together with the names used in the first edition and their 
modem equivalents adopted in the present Catalogue. I have also 
added the name of the museum where the figured specimens may 
be seen, but there are still several species of which the originals

In 1829 there also appeared an important paper by Murcliison 
On the Coalfield of Brora, in Sutherlandshire, and some of the 
stratified deposits in the North of Scotland.^ Murchison's attention 
was first called to this district by Buckland & Lyell, who visited 
Brora in 1824, and were led to express the opinion that the 
Sutherlandshire Coalfield should be included in the Oolite division 
of the Jurassic system. Konig contributed some notes on an 
equisetaceous plant, which he named Oncylogonatum carbonarium 



Murchison (29). 



INTRODUCTION. 9 

(no doubt identical with Equisetites columnaris, Brongn.), and on 
some " subtriangular or inversely cordate carbonaceous plates," 
which are probably the scales of a female Araucarian cone. In 
referring to the Brora plants, Murchison makes the following 
observation : — "If the mode of distribution and the generic 
characters of these fossil plants be ever reduced under general 
laws, they will no longer be regarded as anomalies, but will form 
an important addition to the natural history of the beds with 
which they are associated." * 

The Fossil Flora of Great Britain, by Lindley & Hutton, which 
appeared in parts between the years 1831 and 1837,* contains 
drawings and descriptive notes of several species of Jurassic 
plants ; several of these were communicated by the younger 
Williamson, and others by Bean, Murray, Dunn, and Phillips. 
There is an interesting reference in Williamson's autobiography 
to his share in the production of the Fossil Fhra. He speaks 
of Mr. Dunn, Secretary to the Literary and Philosophical Society 
of Scarborough, as having urged him to undertake the drawings, 
which were made " at one end of Mr. Weddell's kitchen-table, 
whilst the housekeeper was occupied at the other end with the 
several processes of providing the day's dinner." ' Williamson 
was at this time a medical student living in the house of 
Mr. Thomas Weddell, a practitioner in Scarborough. 

The following list includes such plants from Yorkshire as are 
figured by Lindley & Hutton. I have added the modem names, 
and mentioned the museums in which I have seen some of the 
figured specimens. The date of publication is appended in each case. *

In Williamson's papers read before the Geological Society in 
1834 and 1836,' a list is given of Oolitic plants, but one of the 
most important additions to the geology of the plant-bearing strata 
in these contributions is the correction of Phillips' mistake as to 
the horizon of the Gristhorpe plant-bed. 

An important paper was read before the Geological Society of 
London in 1851 by Bunbury,* On some Fossil Plants from the 
Jurassic Strata of the Yorkshire Coast, in which several species 
are critically discussed, and illustrated by accurate drawings ; the 
species specially referred to include the following: —

The two folio volumes by Zigno entitled Flora Fossilis 
Formationis Oolithicee, published between 1856 and 1885,' contain 
numerous references to British Jurassic plants ; these are quoted 
in the lists of synonyms of the various species dealt with in the 
Catalogue. 

In Hugh Miller's Testimony of the Hoch,^ reference is made 
to the occurrence of several plants in the Helmsdale deposits of 
Sutherlandshire' identical with Lower Oolite species from the 
Yorkshire coast. The Mesozoic flora of Scotland is in need of 
further investigation, and it is proposed to deal elsewhere with the 
botany and geology of these northern species. 

In 1864 Leckenby* described and figured "some new or 
imperfectly known species" of East Yorkshire plants ; most of the 
specimens dealt with are included in the Leckenby Collection, 
which Professor Adam Sedgwick purchased in 1872 for the 
"Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge : — *

The writings of Morris,^ Carruthers,' Starkie Gardner,' and 
others contain scattered references to descriptions of Lower Oolite 
plants ; several species of the British Jurassic flora are dealt with 
also by Saporta * in his Monograph on the plants of this period. 

The most important of the more modem contributions to our 
knowledge of the Jurassic plants of England is unfortunately- 
written in the Swedish language, and is not accompanied by any 
illustrations. In 1880 Nathorst* published a series of notes on his 
visits to various English Museums, together with observations 
made in the field at some of the principal plant localities on the 
Yorkshire coast. The same author discovered a new plant-bed 
between White Nab and Scarborough, which enabled him to add 
some new species to the Lower Oolite flora. Nathorst's notes 
have proved of considerable value in the examination of the 
Yorkshire plants, and his opinions on the several species are 
frequently referred to in the descriptive part of this Catalogue. 
The following new species are mentioned or briefly described, 
but in some cases I have been led to identify them with species 
previously recorded. Whether or not Nathorst's supposed new 
species should be retained, there can be no question as to the 
great value of his critical notes.

Among the works dealing more especially with the stratigraphy 
of the Lower Oolite rocks of Yorkshire, reference may be made 
to the Geological Survey Memoirs by Messrs. Fox-Strangways, 
Barrow,^ and H. B. "Woodward,^ and to a series of valuable papers 
by Hudleston,^ published in the Proceedings of the Geologists' 
Association, also to Etheridge's Presidential Address of 1882.* 

The second volume of the Geological Survey Memoirs on 
the Jurassic rocks of Britain, contains a long list of fossils by 
Fox-Strangways, who acknowledges assistance in the revision of 
the plants by Clement Eeid.^ As this is the most recent list 
of plants hitherto published, and is largely founded on the notes 
by Nathorst to which reference has already been made, I have 
enumerated those species from Fox-Strangways' list which are 
referred to as "species now recognized," adding in each case the 
names employed in the present Catalogue. A change of nomen-

A glance at a geological map of England reveals the existence of 
a band of Jurassic rocks stretcMng diagonally across England from 
the coast of Yorkshire to Dorsetshire in the south-west. Between 
the Yorkshire strata and those of corresponding age in the midland

and south-west districts there is a striking difference as regards 
petrological characters, thickness, and fossil contents. The sedi- 
mentary rocks in the north-eastern area consist of a considerable 
thickness of estuarine or freshwater deposits, with here and there

a thin marine band, whereas in the other districts the Lower 
Oolite rocks are almost exclusively of marine origin. The country 
between Whitby and a few miles south of Scarborough is occupied 
by Middle and Lower Oolite and Liassic strata ; the accompanying 



18 rMEODIJCTION'. 

map shows the position of the most important localities in this 
part of the coast from which Lower Oolite plants have heen 
obtained. 

The sketch-map shown in Fig. 1 is a simplified form of part of the 
larger map published in the volume of the International Geological 
Congress of 1888. "While illustrating the relation of the Estuarine 
Series of the Inferior Oolite (Bajocian) to the Middle and Upper 
Oolite and to the Cretaceous rocks, it marks the position of the 
chief localities from which the fossil plants dealt with in the 
following pages have been obtained. 

The moorlands and bold headlands of North-East Yorkshire 
constitute an elevated region which is bounded on the west by 
the low-lying Triassic plain of Central Yorkshire. Geologically 
this district is marked off from the other Jurassic areas by well- 
defined characters ; the rocks composing it are chiefly arenaceous, 
with some Oolitic limestones and ironstones and a few thin seams 
of coal. The occurrence of some subordinate marine beds affords 
evidence of the frequent oscillations of level in this part of 
England during the Jurassic period. Broadly speaking, the East 
Yorkshire rocks of Lower Oolite age consist of three important 
Estuarine Series separated from one another by thin bands con- 
taining marine fossils. The following classification illustrates the 
relative positions of these two types of sediments : — 

/'Cornbrash. 
Upper Estuarine Series. 
Scarborough or Grey Limestone Series. 
Lower Oolite. ^ Middle Estuarine Series. 
Millepore Series. 
Lower Estuarine Series. 
,The Dogger and Blea Wyke beds. 

These Lower Oolite rocks of England are correlated with part of 
the Middle or Brown Jura of Germany (L. von Buch and Quenstedt ; 
= Dogger of Oppel), and with the Bathonian and Bajocian of 
French geologists.' 

The Yorkshire Dogger, exposed in the cliff sections of Blea 
Wyke, High Whitby, Saltwick, and elsewhere, forms the lowest 
member of the Lower Oolite rocks ; it is a littoral formation,

consisting largely of rounded blocks (the so-called doggers) of 
sandstone and ironstone. 

The Lower Estuarine Series, exposed at various localities on the 
coast between Eobin Hood Bay and HuntclifE (the latter is situated 
a few miles further north than the coastline shown in the map), 
consists of a considerable thickness of arenaceous and argillaceous 
sediments, associated with beds of oolitic ironstone, thin coal-seams, 
and an abundance of carbonaceous matter. This succession of 
estuarine sediments containing plant remains is capped by a thin 
marine band known as the Eller Beck bed. This is succeeded by 
the Millepore bed, so called from the occurrence of the Polyzoan 
Haplocecia straminea ' (Phill.) ( = Mtllepora and Cricopora straminea), 
which consists of ferruginous sandstone and limestone, and is 
exposed at Cloughton Wyke in its arenaceous facies, and at Gris- 
thorpe Bay and Cayton Bay as a limestone. Above the Millepore 
bed we pass up into the second series of freshwater or estuarine 
beds, known as the Middle Eduarine Series. These deposits 
constitute the principal coal-bearing series in the Inferior Oolite, 
and include the famous plant -bed of Gristhorpe Bay. From the 
Middle Estuarine rocks a certain amount of jet has been obtained ; 
but most of the well-known Whitby jet is of Upper Liassic age. 

Another marine intercalation, the Scarborough or Grey Limestone 
Series, rests on the Middle Estuarine beds ; these blue and grey 
limestones, exposed ia the cliffs at Cloughton Wyke, form the most 
important marine development in the Yorkshire Oolites. Resting 
on the Scarborough limestones there is a third succession of fresh- 
water strata, known as the Upper Estuarine Series, consisting of 
hard siliceous rocks, sandstones, shales, and ironstones, including 
much carbonaceous matter. Some species of plants have been 
obtained from sandstone strata in the lower part of this third 
Estuarine Series, which occupies nearly the whole of the moorlands 
of the East Yorkshire area. 

At the summit of the Inferior OoHte we have the Cornbrash, 
so named by William Smith, which is made up of calcareous beds 
containing abundant marine fossils, and is exposed in the Ca)i;on 
and Gristhorpe Bay sections.

20 INTRODTTCTIOIir. 

The conditions under which, the estuarine sediments of the 
Yorkshire area were laid down are briefly dealt with in the con- 
cluding pages of the Catalogue. As the present volume deals only 
with the Inferior Oolite plants of East Yorkshire, the consideration 
of the Stonesfield flora and of other Oolitic plants recorded from 
various British localities is reserved for the second volume of the 
Jurassic Flora Catalogue. 



JURASSIC PLANT-BEARING STRATA OF FRANCE, 
GERMANY, AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 

The following incomplete account of extra-British Jurassic plant- 
bearing strata is intended to draw attention to the principal floras, 
v^hich present a more or less close resemblance to that facies of 
Jurassic vegetation represented by the plants from the Yorkshire 
coast. In the following lists of plants the right-hand column is 
intended to illustrate the resemblance or possible identity of British 
species with species described fiom other countries ; a more detailed 
comparison may be found in the descriptive part of the Catalogue. 



FRANCE. 

One of the earliest notices of French Jurassic plants occurs in 
a memoir by Desnoyers^ on the Oolite rocks of Mamers in the 
department of Sarthe in the north-west of France, containing a few 
notes by Brongniart on some species of fossil plants. 

Some years later Pomel ^ published a series of notes on Jurassic 
plants from several localities and horizons, and proposed a large 
number of new generic names, most of which have not been retained. 
A small number of species is enumerated also by Brongniart in 
his Prodrome^ of 1828, and in the Tableau'^ published in 1849; 
but it is in the well-known volumes by Saporta* that we find

the fullest account of the Jurassic plants of France. Some of the 
figures in Saporta's monograph are reproduced from di'a wings 
originally prepared for Brongniart, and these enable us to recognize 
certain species which are mentioned but not described in the 
Prodrome and the Tableau. Several of the specimens figured in 
Saporta's volumes are in the Museum of Natural History and 
in the School of Mines, Paris ; an examination of some of the 
type-specimens impressed upon me the need of considerable caution 
in drawing conclusions from the figures alone, many of which are 
far from accurate. In the following list only such plants are 
included as present a close resemblance to East Yorkshire species, 
or agree approximately in age with the British species. Several 
species of Sphe7iopteris, Scleropteris, Cladophlebis, and other ferns 
have been omitted, as they are often founded on fragmentaiy 
and insufficient material. Most of the strata from which the 
Jurassic plants of France have been obtained are of marine origin. 
Among the most important localities from the point of view of a 
comparison of the French and English species are Mamers 
(Bathonian), D'Etrochey (Combrash), and Chateauroux (Corallian), 
in the departments of Sarthe, Cote d'Or, and Indre respectively. 
The numerous fossils referred by Saporta to Algae need not be 
considered; they have no representatives in the Yorkshire beds, 
and most of them have in all probability no claim to be included 
in the plant kingdom.

A few species of Inferior Oolite plants have been recorded by 
Fliche & Bleicher' from strata in the neighbourhood of Nancy, 
but the fragments figured are too small to admit of accurate 
determination. 

Additions have been made to the plants from French Jurassic 
strata by Crie, who records some new species from Mamers and 
other localities. This author has also published brief notes on the 
comparison of French Jurassic plants with species from England, 
Portugal, and the Southern Hemisphere.* A fern described by 
Zeiller as Acrostichides rhombifolius, var. rarinervis, Font., from 
the Gres bigarre of Saint-Germain bears a close resemblance to 
Todites Williamsoni from the English Oolitic rocks.' 



GERMANY. 

The chief developments of Jurassic rocks in Germany are referred 
by Kayser * to three principal areas : 

1. Franko-Swabian area, forming a large curve, "one arm of 
which extends with a south-easterly strike from the region 
of Coburg to Regensburg, whilst the other stretches thence 
in a south-westerly direction to the foot of the Black 
Forest. " The passage - beds between the Keuper and

24 rNTKODUCTION. 

Liassic rocks of the north arm of this area have afforded 
a particularly rich flora, which has been described in 
detail by Schenk ^ ; this flora is referred to later. 

2. North-West Germany; from Helmstedt and Quedlinburg to 

the Teutoberger Wald. Several Wealden species have been 
described from this region.* 

3. Upper Silesian Jura. A belt thirty miles long, from Cracow 

to Kalisch. 

Kurr^ has described a few species of plants from the Swabian 
Jura, "vyhich suggest a Liassic horizon ; a few of these may be 
compared with East Yorkshire species : 

Zamites Mandelslohif'KvucT; cf. Otozamites parallelus (PYxUl.). 
Zamites gracilis, Kurr ; cf. small forms of Williamsonia pecten (Phill.). 

From the Solenhofen beds in Franconia,* which are classed with 
the Upper or White Jura, several plants have been recorded, 
especially species of conifers. 

The fossil flora of Bamberg, Bayreuth, and other localities in the 
Franconian area is one of the richest in Europe. Plants from these 
localities have been described by Sternberg, Goppert, Braun, and 
others, but it is to Schenk ^ that we owe the most complete account 
of this Rhaetic-Lias flora. Attention has been called by Braun, * 
and more recently by Nathorst, to the close agreement or even 
identity of many of the Franconian plants with species of Lower 
Oolite age from East Yorkshire. The following list includes such 
species as illustrate most clearly the marked Lower Oolitic facies 
of the Keuper and Lias flora.

AUSTKIA. 

Jurassic plants are poorly represented in the Austrian Empire. 
The well-known floras of Lunz in Lower Austria and Raibl in 
Carinthia belong to an earlier epoch, and present but few points of 
contact with the Lower Oolite flora of England. 

From Steierdorf in Banat in the south-eastern part of Hungary, 
Ettingshausen ' described a few plants in 1852; but this flora has 
been more fully dealt with by Andrae,* who recognized nine species 
as identical with Lower Oolite types from the Yorkshire coast. As 
a few only of Andrae's plants are figured it is impossible to express 
any opinion as to the identity of some of the species with Lower 
Oolite types.

In 1888 Stur'^ described several species of Jurassic plants from 
Grojec in Galicia, and more recently Eaciborski ^ has published an 
important memoir on the fossil flora of the Cracow district obtained 
from the mines of Grojec and other localities. Many of Eaciborski' s 
species are undoubtedly identical with East Yorkshire plants ; and 
the flora as a whole presents a closer agreement with that of the 
Inferior Oolite than with any other period. Eaciborski recognizes 
the correspondence between the Cracow plants and those from the 
Yorkshire coast, but from the presence of Thinnfeldia and some 
other Ehsetic types he concludes that the flora he describes is 
slightly older than the English flora.

ITALY. 

By far the most important contribution to the Mesozoic Botany 
of Italy is that by Zigno, published in parts between 1856 and 
1885.'' In a preliminary paper published in 1853, Zigno' drew 
attention to the close similarity of the recently discovered Lower 
Oolite (Bathonian) plants of the Venetian Alps with those from

Saporta' have described several species of plants from strata of 
Jurassic age, some of which are probably identical with English 
species. Several of the ' species ' founded by Saporta on extremely 
small fi'agments possess but little value as definite specific types, 
and it is impossible to form any accurate estimate of the number of 
East Yorkshire types which may be represented in the Portuguese 
flora of Jurassic age. 

Eguuetum lusitanicum, Heer, figured by Heer and Saporta, may 
be identical with Equisetites columna/ris, and Ototamites angusti- 
folius, Heer, agrees fairly closely with some of the English examples 
of Williamsonia pecten (Phill.) ; among the fragments referred by 
Saporta to Sphenopteris there are some which recall Coniopteris 
hymenophylloides and C. quinqueloba ; but it is useless to attempt 
to base any detailed comparisons on such imperfect data. 



SCANDINAVIA. 

The Rhsetic flora of Scania, in Southern Sweden, contains several 
species which are closely allied to Lower Oolite types. Nathorst's 
memoirs on the plants from Palsjo, Bjuf, Helsingborg, and other 
localities in Scania, are among the most important contributions 
to our knowledge of Lower Mesozoic floras, and they enable us 
to obtain a fairly comprehensive view of the characteristics of 
Rhaetic vegetation. Nathorst has himself drawn attention to the 
numerous points of contact between the Rhaetic flora of Sweden 
and the later flora of East Yorkshire.^ The following list includes 
such species from Nathorst's lists as best illustrate the existence 
of a Lower Oolite facies in the Swedish flora ; for further 
information regarding the Scanian plants reference must be made 
to Nathorst's memoirs, from which the following species have been 
selected : — '

BORNHOLM. 

Jurassic plants from Bomholm have long been known through the 
description of a few species by Pingel, Brongniart, Forchhammer, 
and Nathorst, but it is only recently that any complete account of 
the fossil flora of this island has been attempted. Bartholin's 
investigations '^ clearly demonstrate the occurrence of several 
Inferior Oolite species in the Bornholm fossil flora ; he concludes 
that rather less than half of the species are identical with or closely 
allied to Rhaetic plants, while about one-third agree with Inferior 
Oolite types. The species enumerated below afford strong evidence 
in favour of the existence of a well-marked Oolitic facies in the 
Bomholm flora ; in fact, I am disposed to consider that the Inferior 
Oolite types predominate over the Rhsetic and Wealden species.

The Mesozoic plants obtained from Advent Bay and Cape

of uppermost Jurassic age.^

Araucarioxylon and two species of Cedroxylon from the plant-beds 
of Green Harbour ; the specimens were originally described by 
Cramer under the generic name Pinites?

Among the Mesozoic floras of the far North the most important, 
from the point of view of the distribution of Lower Oolite species, 
is that which Heer has described from material collected by 
Czekanowski, Hartung, and others. The principal localities at 
which these Jurassic plants were discovered are Ust-Balei, in

In 1879 and 1881 Schmalhausen ' published a memoir on the 
Jura- Flora of Russia, in which he described plants from the coul- 
basin of Kusnezk in the Altai Mountains, in West Siberia, from 
the valley of the Petschora River in North-East European Russia, 
and from the lower Tunguska River in Northern Siberia. From 
these regions he recorded certain species of plants indicative of 
a Jurassic age, such as Ginkgo digitata, Cukanowakia rigida, 
Thyrsopteris prisca, Heer, and other ferns. It is, however, very 
probable, as Zeiller' has shown, that these plant-beds should be 
referred to a Permian horizon. The reasons for this conclusion 
and the correctness of Schmalhausen's determinations are discussed 
at length in Zeiller's paper.

coast of Greenland; he considers the flora to he of Rhsetic or 
Ehaetic-Lias age, hut he expresses his opinion cautiously, and 
points out that the evidence is hardly sufficient to admit of 
accurate determination of the geological horizon. Some of Hartz' 
plants are no doubt identical with Inferior Oolite species.

A few somewhat fragmentary plants have been collected by

a comparison with members of the Inferior Oolite flora of England ; 
but the specimens are hardly numerous enough and sufficiently 
well preserved to afford certain evidence of geological age. 

The plants obtained by Nansen were examined by Nathorst,* 
and compared by him with the Upper Jurassic flora of Spitzbergen. 
Among the specimens mentioned by Nathorst the most interesting 
is a leaf of Ginkgo, very similar to some of the smaller examples

of G. digitata (Brongn.), from the Yorkshire coast, which is 
referred to a new species, G. polans, Nath. ; this might perhaps 
be designated G. digitata, var. polaris. Some of the Jackson- 
Harmsworth plants have been figured in a recent paper by 
I^ewton & Teall.^ The specimens described by the latter authors 
are referred to the genera Ginkgo, Thyrsopteris, Baiera ?, Fieldenia ?, 
Podozamites ? ; but the material is insufficient to enable us to do 
more than express the opinion that the Cape Flora beds may be 
best compared with Oolitic or Wealden strata of other regions. 

Messrs. Newton & Teall have also described some plant remains 
from Cape Stephen, about twenty miles west of Cape Flora, which 
they compare with Schmalhausen's species from Petschora and 
Tunguska. It is very probable that these Franz Josef plants may, 
like Schmalhausen's, be referred to a Penuian horizon. 



NORTH AMERICA. 

1. United States. 

Fontaine's monograph on the older Mesozoic flora of Virginia 
contains several illustrations which forcibly recall Lower Oolite 
plants. It is to be regretted that the drawings of the fossils have 
not been executed in more detail ; they are often too sketchy, 
and presumably somewhat inaccurate, to enable one to feel mucli 
confidence in the nature of the plants represented. Fontaine thus 
concludes the discussion on the age and affinities of the flora : — 
"Eui'opean authors, and especially Schimper, often call attention to 
the strong resemblance between the Rhaetic and Lower Jurassic 
floras, the likeness to the Lower Oolite of England being especially 
striking. In accordance with this fact, the presence of a marked 
Jurassic element in the flora of these Mesozoic beds, both in 
Carolina and Virginia, is of itself an evidence that they cannot 
be older than Rhaetic. We are, then, I think, entitled to consider 
that the older Mesozoic flora of North Carolina and Virginia is 
most probably Rhaetic in age, and certainly not older." *

Stur ' has pointed out the close similarity between the Lunz flora 
of Austria and the Ehaetic flora of Virginia. Perhaps the most 
striking example of a type identical with, or at least very nearly 
allied to, a Lower Oolite species is afforded by some fronds referred 
by Fontaine to the genus Acrostichites. In his description of 
plants fi'om Virginia, Bunbury ^ expressed the view that as regards 
the evidence afforded by the fossil plants the strata might be 
referred with almost equal plausibility to either the Triassic or 
Jurassic series.

The numerous plants described by Fontaine in a later monograph 
on the Potomac or younger Mesozoic flora* consist for the most 
part of Wealden and other Lower Cretaceous species, but Jurassic 
forms are also represented.^ The ' Potomac flora ' of Virginia 
and Maryland is in reality made \ap of floras varying in age fi'om 
Upper Jurassic to the upper members of the Lower Cretaceous, 
and does not represent a single flora marking one definite geological 
horizon. It is unnecessary to attempt a detailed analysis of the 
species described by Fontaine. Several of the plants agree with 
European "Wealden types, others point to a higher horizon, and 
there are a certain number which may be compared with Lower 
Oolite species. It is very difficult to institute any exact comparison 
between the Virginian and the East Yorkshire plants without 
access to the specimens themselves ; the illustrations in Fontaine's 
monograph hardly do justice to the rich material, and the excessive

of the elements of these two floras renders their separation a matter

CHINA. 

Among the Mesozoic plants recorded from China there are some 
species which appear to be identical with Lower Oolite forms. 
Our knowledge of the fossil flora of China is based chiefly on the 
work of Newberry,^ Brongniart,'' and Schenk.'

species of Mesozoic plants from Japan, some of which appear to 
be of Wealden age,* while others from Central Japan indicate an 
Inferior Oolite flora similar to that of East Yorkshire.

INDIA. 

It has long been recognized that some of the Upper Gondwana 
floras of India present several features in common with European 
Jurassic floras. Feistmantel and others have identified various 
plants of the Kach and other Indian floras with Lower Oolite 
species from East Yorkshire, hut it is very probable that the 
correspondence between these widely separated floras has been 
rather underestimated than exaggerated. Eossil plants of the 
Kach (Umia) flora were first described by Morris ^ in Captain Grant's 
Geology of Cutch, published in 1840, and in more recent years 
numerous species have been described by FeistmanteP and 
others,^ The Jabalpur flora, so called from the town of Jabalpur, 
also contains several elements of a marked Lower Oolite facies. 
Both the Jabalpur and the Umia floras appear to be approximately 
of the same age ; in the recent edition of the Geology of India * 
the latter is compared with the Middle and the former with the 
Upper Oolite. Several species of the Eajmahal flora also bear 
a striking resemblance to East Yorkshire types; this flora has 
been referred to the Liassic period. 

In the following list are included such species as appear to be 
identical with or at least closely allied to British Inferior Oolite 
types ; a more detailed comparison is made in several instances 
in the descriptive part of the Catalogue : —

AUSTRALIA. 

A valuable summary and critical review of the " Fossil Flora 
of Australia," by Dr. Feistmantel, was published in 1890 by the 
Department of Mines, New South Wales.'' This work, which was 
based on a memoir previously published in the Faleeontographica 
(1878-79), contains a comprehensive historical sketch of palaeo- 
botanical literature relating to Australia, and a revised list of 
fossil plants from various geological horizons. 



^ Identified by Schenk (83), p. 253, as Asplenium whitbierue.

Since the publication of Feistmantel's work several species of 
Queensland plants have been recorded by Jack 8c Etheridge ^ 
in their Geology of Queensland and New Guinea. More recently 
specimens have been collected by the staff of the Geological 
Survey, and some of these are described by Shirley* in a paper 
contained in Bulletin No. 7 of the Queensland Geological Survey. 
Some of the species of Ginkgo and Baiera instituted by this author 
are founded on imperfect specimens hardly worthy of being raised 
to the rank of type -specimens. Among the leaves referred to 
these two genera there are some examples which bear a fairly 
close resemblance to Baiera gracilis, Bunb., e.g. Ginkgo bidens 
(Ten.- Woods) and Baiera ipsviciensis, Shir. A fragment named 
Dictyophyllum Bremerense may be compared with D. rugosum, 
L. & H., and a leaf figured as Sagenopteris rhoifolia recalls 
S. PhilUpsi (Brongn.). The specimens described as Beania 
geminata afford little or no evidence of generic identity with 
Carruthers' genus. Some of the fossils figured by these authors 
are referred to in the descriptive part of the Catalogue.
