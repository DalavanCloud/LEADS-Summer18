PREFACE. 



An endeavour to preserve sonic memorial of the brilliant and fugitive beauties, 
of a |mrtieularly splendid ami elegant ItiIk* of plants, Hrst gave rise to tin* 
work; and having cnjovcd considerable* perhaps unusual, advantages, in the verv 
great lihcralitv with winch s|hn imca* were supplied* both from public, and private 
collections, it became a favorite recreation, in describe them as simply ami naturally 
OH |Hi»ihh\ with both pen ami pencil. Flattered by the opinion of her friends, 
and encouraged by competent judge* of the fidelity of the Portraits, Mrs. Kdward 
Burv hus yielded) to their wishes, and ventured to lav them before the public. 
To render them more worthy, she has availed herself of the help and instructions 
of I be Messrs, Shepherd. Curators of the Liverpool Botanic Imrden, in examining 
the Plants themselves with reference to the l*est Authorities within her reach; 
these she has freely quoted from* or cited its synouynics whenever their application 

appeared to Iter plain and distinct; when* doubt* or intricacy seem to exist* she 
leave* it for wiser heads to unravel. Having no pretensions whatever* either to 

scientific knowledge, or extensive research* any attempt at lengthened technical 
descriptions, is purposely avoided; hut for this defect some congelation may he 
found in Sir J, li Smiths opiuou on tins subject, that " Truth does not require 
hard words," Following therefore the advice of that enlightened, and highly dis- 
tinguished Benefactor of Natural Science* she has uicrelv "aimed at writing common 
sense in plain English." and relies on the indulgence and courtesy of those more 
able and learned promoters, or generous admirers of botanical pursuits, who may be 
induced to patronize the feeble attempts, of an Amateur. 

Far liettcr thanlis than she well knows how to express, are due to many Iriends 
(some atas! to whose cherished ntetnortf only, the tribute euu now be paid, 
for the great assistance and support which has been conferred during the progress 
of the undertaking, particularly to Itichard Harrison, Iwp; to Mr, Shepherd, and 
Mr. Henry Shepherd; also for the kind approbation of the President of the Horti- 
cultural Society, T. Knight. Eso;. ; and it is a proud distinction to be permitted to 
record, the liberal and valued encouragement and information, so kindly given at 
its commencement, by that bright example in the [>aths of Literature and Science, 
the late William RoscOCj Ksip The Work has caused many hours of delightful 
occupation, and the labours of the |H?ncil have been skilfully seconded by those of 
the Kngraver. Indulgence is again entreated for all errors and imperfections, 
art she has been able only to glean a few cars, from a harvest so rich, « arrayed 
in all the glory' 1 of rainbow hues.

Ploweh-btbm aboul sixteen inches high, much striated wilh dark purple, 
and very glaucous — leave* dnrk, luxuriant, autl a good dual variegated, 
operiully Inward* the points— corolla of a dark blood-red colour, with a 
fringed ucctarv in I he throat spallie brown -number of flowers varying from 

four to eight* 

Tins Lily is sufficiently vvorlhy of distinction from its splendid appear- 
ance, Imt Mill more so, as being the tirst hybritl Amaryllis on record* and 
having caused many learned disputes on the subject, for the investigation of 
which, those who are interested arc referred to a Paper by .1- It. Gowen, 
Esq. published in the Horticultural Transaction$ $ ml 4. />. 498 ; to the 
several J2**«f/* by the* Honourable W. Hkrhkkt: and a Paper by .Mr. 
LcfpLEY, Horticultural Transaction*! ruL'y.p. 337. Hybrid plants of every 
possible degree and variety of mixture are now become so general and nume- 
rous, that it seems equally vain and useless to attempt to trace their parentage 
in every instance; and runny seedlings from Amaryllis Regime ami others have 
obtained the appellation of "Johnsonian." The prototype is said to have been 
tirst raised about the year I7!M>, from the seed of Vittata impregnated with 
Formosis*ima, by Mr Johnson, a maker of gold hands for watches, hi the 
town of Present, ami the present specimen is from one of the Original bnlhs. 
presented by Mr, Johnson to the late Edwahd Fw.knick, Esu. of Fairfield, 
near Liverpool. The striped markings of the stem and leaves OW ft pretty 
constant characteristic of the true tlolmsuni.

L ILIUM JAPONICUM. 



Nat. OiemiB— LI LI AC K. Lindlky. 



This Lily has been generally described and figured as one*flontore& In 
the Horticultural Transactions col 4. p- 553; it is stated that our know- 
ledge of l-iliuni Japonicum as a native of Japan, was derived Hrsl from 
K buffer (Amcenilate* eoofttttf, /«w S7ty ft,1, l ftfterwards from Thuwbjrbc 
'Flora JaponicGi page 133J; from the accounts of both these writers it 
appears l<> produce only one flower on a stem in its native country, but under 
the cultivation of Mr. Baoorbs it had produced three dowers on one stem. 
The specimen from which this drawing waa made grew in ihe Liverpool 
Botanic Garden, in u plot of liu'ht black loam, shaded by hiirh hed«o>— there 
they have flourished lor a series of years with such strength and luxuriance 
of growth, thai many stems riae to four *>r five feet in height, producing five 
or six (lowers on each— U Japoaicum is a larger, and may perhaps be 
designated a coarser plant than Candidum <>r Longiflorum to both of which 
it is nearly allied. The purple marking on the buck, together with the 
tinge of Limeric tan colour diffused through the petals especially on their 
Hrst expansion! give u charming richness of appearance^ which is enhanced 
by the deep shade of the tinn hollow bellfl, and massive looking pistyfe 
and stamens-

Ihe Liverpool Itotanic Cinrden on the l'iih May, ISjl), afforded an excellent 
opportunity uf examining the reeorded disiiurljotiM between these two very 
similar, and equally noble and beautiful rivals. The proportionate length of 
Ihe nigh* and Jihtnwufrt, varied eoiisideraldy in different (lowers on Imtli 
plants, ilu* majority probably being of about equal length. The potafa of 
nugu&tum were generally somewhat broader ami of a brighter and redder hue, 
out tin* also appeared to rary a good dealj according 10 the slate of expansion 
and perfection of growth of the individual (lower. The principal difference 
seems to enusi<*t in Hie /e//rey, whieh in ainalnle are broader and *liorter, while 
in augustum they taper oil" more gradually to a point The accompanying 
drawing was from a plant in the Hothouse of It. ILueiuson Esq. in August.
