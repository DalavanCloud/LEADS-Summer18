PREFACE 

TO THE FIRST EDITION. 



Now that the work is just ready to appear, I am thankful 
to him [the Publisher] for the opportunity of saying in this 
prefatory page, with what pride and pleasure I have looked 
over the accessories and embellishments with which, by his 
zeal and spirit, and by the admirable co-operation he has 
been so fortunate to secure, my humble work is elevated 
to a quality of real importance. ^ ^ * If my 
gratitude to my coadjutors causes me to overrate the product 
of our labours, I shall not at least be mistaken in saying 
that we have all done our best to set forth a true present- 
ment of the land we love, in the hope of inducing and 
enabling those who live in town or plain to know and love 
it as we do. If any think that we have painted it too fair, 
and that we love it fanatically, let them come and see. 

H. MARTINEAU.

THE RAILWAY APPROACHES. 

The mountain-region of Cumberland and Westmorland and that 
part of the County of Lancashire which lies north of the Sands 
and embraces the fair and wealthy region of Furness, has for its 
nucleus the cluster of tall mountains of which Scawfell is the 
highest. There are the loftiest peaks and deepest valleys. 
These are surrounded by somewhat lower ridges and shallower 
vales ; and these again by others, till the uplands are mere hills 
and the valleys scarcely sunk at all. It is into these exterior 
undulations that the railways penetrate. If the time should 
ever come when iron roads intersect the mountainous parts of 
Westmorland and Cumberland, that time is not yet, loud as have 
been the lamentations of some residents.* It is a great thing 
that steam can convey travellers round the outskirts of the dis- 
trict, and up to its openings. These openings are numerous ; 
and we therefore give a few hints as regards the Lines and the 
points at which passengers are deposited. This will be much 
facilitated by reference to our Maps and * Bradshaw.' 

The *XSMantl * Railway, (as viewed by the traveller from the 
south or east), makes its inroad into our precincts, by sending out 
its long arm (The * Furness' Line) from Carnforth, stretching 
over Morecambe Bay and round the lower hills to the foot of 
Winandermere. As the name of this railway implies, it passes 
through the midst of England, on its route northward from St. 

* Mr. Wordsworth, the late poet laureate, remonstrated against the 
intrusion of the railway.

Pancras Station, London. Besides the Metropolis itself, the 
cities and towns of Bedford, Northampton, Cambridge, Leices- 
ter, Birmingham, Worcester, Cheltenham, Lincoln, Peterborough, 
Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield, Rotherham, Wakefield, Leeds, 
Bradford, and Skipton, send their inhabitants to Lakeland by 
this Line. The traveller passes through some of the towns and 
sees important manufactures carried on close by the train. 
Sheffield and Leeds are perhaps the most remarkable examples. 
Here are innumerable furnaces, with tongues of flame stretching 
out greedily, one thinks, to set on fire the whole neighbourhood ; 
there is a perfect forest of gigantic chimneys, — monuments of 
manufacturing industry ; and there also are the factories them- 
selves, some of which are of mighty proportions and, by their 
beautiful architecture, suggest palaces rather than workshops. 
Witness also, about Leeds, the wilderness of railway-carriages, 
engines, and other vehicles, giving but faint idea of the enormous 
traffic to and from this wonderful focus of lines. The train glides 
steadily through, however, with huge mills and machine-works on 
either hand. When the open country is again reached, here, by 
the very side of the railway, we see quarried the beautiful free- 
stone of the region, which, besides supplying the demands of the 
locality, is conveyed hundreds of miles to form the important fea- 
tures of our best buildings. Now the railway runs in a fertile 
valley, and a fair view is obtained of the ruins of Kirkstall Abbey. 
Higher up, on the slope, are the estates, homes, and mansions 
of the wealthy of the neighbourhood, — such a panorama of the 
kind as we have seen from no other railway. At Keighley we 
are within three and a-half miles of Haworth, where dwelt the 
three Brontes in the rectory of their father, and between here 
and our destination the famous and most interesting Cave-dis- 
trict of Ingleborough is passed, which has been very graphically 
described by Mr. Payn in his ' Leaves from Lakeland.' Carn- 
forth, with its large iron-works, is soon reached by our express 
train ; then Morecambe Bay, which the railway crosses by some 
marvellous engineering works, before reaching Grange, a thriv- 
ing, and the traveller will say, as he views it from the carriage- 
window, attractive spot. Indeed, we may say, in passing, that 



we know of no sea-side resort which has, besides its first attrac- 
tions, rock, hill, and charming woodland in such abundance and 
variety as ' Grange-over-Sands/ We shall, of course, have to 
visit it after our devotions have been paid to the peerless lakes. 
For many miles we have the sea as our close companion ; now 
we cross its bays, now we skirt the shore ; then the hills begin 
to rise about us, the foliage to thicken, even the rugged rocks 
which are peeping out seem to bid us welcome ; and so, after a 
short tunnel or two, we are brought face to face with the * Queen 
of the Lakes/ It is true she is tame here ; but, as a general 
rule, lakes should be approached from the foot, that the ridges 
may rise, rather than sink, before the observer's eye. The 
steamer is alongside the station, waiting our arrival ; we step on 
board and in a few minutes are steaming on our northward 
course. Fell Foot, on our right, is a charming residence ; and 
about us, on the water, are numerous sailing, steaming, and row- 
ing boats indicating the occupant's aquatic tastes. Between this 
and Storrs, is the least interesting part of Winandermere, a dis- 
tance of about four miles ; but it is everywhere beautiful and 
will, even here, give great pleasure to the eye fresh from scenes 
less fair. We shall have to revert to Storrs and its memories in 
a future page ; also to the Ferry Hotel and its surroundings. 
Meantime the visitor may very distinctly note from the deck of 
the steamer the road climbing the hill behind the latter, which is 
the nearest way to Esthwaite Water and Coniston. Now we 
skirt the south-eastern margin of Belle Isle, and almost immedi- 
ately turn sharply upon the busy scene in Bowness Bay. The 
steamer winds its way through the smaller craft, and we are de- 
deposited on the landing-stage. Whether our destination be 
Bowness or Windermere Village, abundant means of transit will 
be found. The latter is a mile and a-half distant ; but the two 
are so intimately connected, that it will best answer the purpose 
of this book if they are taken as one, which certainly they shortly 
will be if building continues at its present rate in the gap be- 
ween them. Our ' Midland' tourist, then, has arrived either at 
Bowness or Windermere, and will look for further instructions 
at a future page. 



4 ^ailbjag ^^pproari&es, 

<^0nfst0n is reached by the Midland and Furness Lines ; and 
325? astinater is only seven miles from Drigg Station on the latter 
railway ; but the number of tourists entering the district from 
these latter points is inconsiderable. 

The * Jlionbon ant( 'Jg^ort^f "^M'estetn * was the first to 

reach the Lake Country (in the year 1847) and consequently its 
matured connections, in and about the district, make it a most 
desirable route. Since that time Windermere, at the terminus 
of the railway, a place rapidly rising to the dimensions of a town, 
has been built, and from thence run Coaches and other public 
conveyances which penetrate almost every part of the region. 

In coming from London (Euston Station), we pass through 
the bright sunny fields of Hertfordshire and away on to Rugby, 
part of the town being visible on the left ; Stafford, Crewe (the 
depot of the Company for locomotives, &c., in the construction 
and repair of which a large portion of the {)opulation is em- 
ployed) ; Warrington ; Wigan (an important coal-field) ; Preston 
(cotton manufactures) ; Lancaster ; Kendal (famous for its rail- 
way rugs, horse-cloths, &c.) ; and then up the Valley of the 
Kent to the hills. The train is pulled up before reaching the 
terminus, and here the traveller gets his first peep of the river- 
lake. If he be going to Bowness (a mile and a-half distant), 
by the margin of the lake, carriages, omnibusses, coaches, and 
other vehicles are waiting to convey him to his destination ; other- 
wise, this new Village of Windermere, standing on high ground 
and commanding nearly the whole length of the lake, will afford 
him abundance of the best accommodation. 

The next important railway-entrance to the district is by the 
new branch line out of the L. & N. W. from Penrith to Keswick. 
This route will, of course, be taken by passengers from the north 
and some from the south who wish to commence their tour at 
Keswick. Many of the latter, however, prefer leaving the railway 
or steamer at Windermere or Bowness, as the case may be, and 
taking the charming drive by coach from thence to Keswick, 



which occupies about an hour longer than going direct from the 
south by railway. Keswick is also reached from the west, via 
Cockermouth and Bassenthwaite ; but this route is by no means 
a frequented one. 



Supposing that the traveller desires to see the lakes and 
mountains thoroughly ; having now shown him the way thither, 
we shall divide our further directions into Districts round the 
towns and villages best suited for the purpose ; yfn-/ giving short 
instructions how to get direct thence to other important places ; 
and then describing fully what is to be seen within a moderate 
Walk ; and thirdly, guiding him over the Drives and Mountain 
Trips which may be easily taken in a day. The ^ MILES ^ 
given by the side of each page are reckoned from the starting- 
point of the Walk or Excursion to which they are subjoined ; 
and the figures refer to the places alluded to in the line opposite. 

The Plans of Towns and Villages, Mountain OutHnes, and 
Maps, especially those showing the ways up the principal moun- 
tains, will materially assist the traveller in his rambles. The 
utility of these will, however, be greatly increased by the posses- 
sion of a pocket compass, without which no novice should at- 
tempt mountaineering. We need hardly suggest a satchel, a 
flask ^ with something in it ' a light waterproof, and a stout stick 
or alpenstock, or, if preferred, a strong umbrella, which will be 
found serviceable in a scorching sun or as a shelter from the 
downpour which occasionally surprises the traveller in this 
region.

Thirty-five years ago, ""SSTinantiermere was so secluded 
that it was some distinction even for a travelled man to have 
seen it. Now there is a Windermere Railway Station, and 
a Windermere Post-office and Hotel, — a thriving "yiTillage of 
"ySSTintiermett, with good inns, and many excellent Lodging- 
houses. The village occupies a commanding yet sheltered 
position, 300 feet above lake-level, on the western slope of 
Orrest Head, — well raised above the damp and mist that 
often overhang the lake; hence the climate is salubrious. 
The natural advantages, coupled with the possession of that 
most important of modern indispensables, — a * first-class' 
railway station, with coaches starting therefrom to all parts 
of the district, have induced many families to settle here. 



12 "55?al{t0 at "ySaTintiermere* 

The neighbourhood is dotted with numerous villas, nearly all 
of which command charming views of lake and mountain. 
The new buildings (and all are new) are of the dark grey- 
stone of the region ; several of them in the medaeval style of 
architecture. The Rev. J. A. Addison, who built the church 
and was the first clergyman here, had a passion for ecclesias- 
tical architecture; and his example has been a good deal 
followed. There is the ©Ti^urcji of St. Mary, and there are 
the schools belonging to it with their steep roofs of curiously- 
shaped slates, both of which the vicarage overlooks. There 
is also the ©'olleije of St. Mary, standing in a fine position 
between the main road and the descent to the lake. This 
college — which may be distinguished by its square tower, — 
was originally intended as a place of education for the sons 
of the clergy ; but, proving unsuccessful in that form, is now 
a flourishing first-class school. 



ORREST HEAD.* 

The hill rising behind the hotel, called Orrest Head, is 
approached by a lane adjoining the house of that name. 
The traveller should by no means miss the walk. All the 
way up, the views are exquisite : but that from the summit, — 
above 650 feet above the lake, — is one of the finest the 
district can show. The whole length of "^iSJinantiermere ex- 
tends below, with its enclosing hills and wooded islands ; and 
towards the head, most of the highest peaks and ridges may 

* It is necessary to say that ^his description of the walk to Orrest 
Head is as it was written in 1852, by the authoress of this guide. The 
path was then, and had for years previously, been used, without hinder- 
ance, by residents and tourists ; but, in' 1873, on the property changing 
hands, gates were locked and stiles walled up, and therefore the visitor 
must be apprised of these obstacles ; but the editor thinks it right, 
under the circumstances, that the original description, with this explana- 
tion, should remain in the volume.
