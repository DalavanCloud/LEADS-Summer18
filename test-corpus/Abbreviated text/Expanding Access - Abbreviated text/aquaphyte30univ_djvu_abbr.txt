News from APIRS 

By Karen Brown 

T he Aquatic Plant Information Retrieval System (APIRS) continues to grow, with the number of 
annotated records now exceeding 80,000. As longtime contributors to APIRS know, the database has 
been in service since the mid-1980s, providing access to the collective literature on aquatic plant species. 
The original mission of the database was to aid aquatic weed managers in developing countries. Prob¬ 
lems included stranded villages, inaccessible fishing areas, impassable waterways, disease transmission, 
clogged reservoirs, weed-choked irrigation and drainage canals, and more. Initial APIRS funding was 
provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). As the database grew to include 
a wider geographic range (worldwide) and a broader scope (riparian, wetland, salt marsh, macroalgae, 
some seagrasses, Florida mangroves, and more), the workload grew. Primary financial support shifted 
to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Aquatic Plant Control Research Program (APCRP), the agency 
charged with maintaining federal navigable waterways, including weed control. One of Florida’s own 
federal waterways, the St. Johns River, has a colorful history that includes the lavender fiowers of water 
hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes) covering the water surface from shore to shore. The University of 
Florida also supported one full-time position. Meanwhile, computer technology was evolving to enable 
easier and faster searches of the APIRS database. Original searches were performed in overnight batches 
at the University’s regional data center, using complex Boolean search strings. Resultant bibliographies 
were printed and mailed to researchers. No fees were charged as the database grew largely from con¬ 
tributions of articles by researchers. We enjoyed colorful stamps from around the world and friendly 
correspondence from scientists, libraries and research institutions. 

The advent of the Internet made the Center’s website possible in 1995 and allowed online access 
to the database shortly thereafter. The commercial search software used was extremely expensive and 
required upgrades we were unable to afford. Search commands were still complex. Although access 
was now available to all, in reality, only two of us knew how to effectively search APIRS. By 2005 
and with primary funding now coming from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, 
Invasive Plant Management Section (previously the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 
Bureau of Aquatic Plant Management), APIRS had become part of a broader range of services. Thanks 
to the creative energy of its founder, the late Vic Ramey, APIRS had been Joined by an expansive 
website and many educational materials such as original video productions on aquatic plant identifi¬ 
cation and management, botanical drawings, photographs, and a companion website. Plant Manage¬ 
ment in Florida Waters . A second companion website, the Florida Invasive Plant Education Initiative , 
was developed to help school teachers introduce this topic to young students. To incorporate these 
expansions and clarify our larger purpose, we became known simply as the Information Office of the 
Center for Aquatic Plants. The Center, too, ultimately expanded to become the Center for Aquatic and 
Invasive Plants (CAIP), as invasive terrestrial (or upland) plants in Florida’s public lands had grown 
to frightening proportions. In addition to our lakes, rivers and wetlands, gems such as Everglades Na¬ 
tional Park were threatened with loss of their native vegetation and alteration of ecosystem functions 
from encroachment of invasive plant species. Many seasoned aquatic biologists and natural resource 
managers shared their expertise and expanded their work into upland areas because the overall goal 
was the same—to control invasive plant infestations and protect natural resources. APIRS staff

At the Center 2010-2011 

By Dr. William T. Haller, Acting Director 

T he faculty and staff at the UF/IFAS Center for Aquatic and 
Invasive Plants (CAIP) were very active this past year con¬ 
ducting research and educational programs on invasive plant biol¬ 
ogy and control. Major cooperative programs are conducted with 
numerous partners including, but not limited to, the Invasive Plant 
Management section of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conserva¬ 
tion Commission (FWC), Osceola County, the St. Johns and South 
Florida Water Management Districts, and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers Environmental Research and Development Center. A 
highlight in 2010 was the release of the Aquatic Weed Control Best 
Management Practices manual, edited by Dr. Gettys, Dr. Bellaud, 
and myself, and published by the Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration 
Foundation tAERFf More than 20 authors contributed chapters 
to the manual. The first printing of 12,000 copies is nearly deplet¬ 
ed. The manual can be viewed or downloaded from the CAIP or 
AERF websites. 

The CAIP was formed within the University of Florida’s Agri¬ 
cultural Experiment Station by the 1978 Florida Eegislature. The 
mission of the CAIP is to provide support and coordination to the 
UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Science (IFAS) faculty and 
staff working on developing environmentally-sound management 
practices for aquatic and natural area weeds. The CAIP is also re¬ 
sponsible for extending information on the benefits of native plants 
and the impacts of invasive weeds to the public. This is accom¬ 
plished by providing written information ( edis.ifas.ufl.edu ), online 
communication materials, and training courses. 

The annual Aquatic Weed Short Course was presented in May 
2011 in Coral Springs, FE with over 400 attendees. The course 
is designed in cooperation with the Florida Department of Agri¬ 
culture and Consumer Services (FDACS) to provide Continuing 
Education Units (CEUs) to licensed pesticide applicators and pro¬ 
vide basic training for those (>150) taking pesticide certification 
exams for the first time. The Southeast Herbicide Applicators Con¬ 
ference (SEHAC) is planned for North Florida (Panama City) in 
early October 2011. More conference information is available at 
the website. 

The annual PEANT CAMP workshop for school teachers, pro¬ 
duced by CAIP Education Initiative Coordinator Amy Richard, 
was held June 11-15 in Gainesville. Twenty-four teachers attend¬ 
ed, representing school districts and environmental centers from 
around the state. PEANT CAMP is part of the CAIP’s Invasive 
Plant Education Initiative that provides training, field experience, 
plant identification, interactive activities, communication materi¬ 
als, and full curriculum (that meets Florida’s Sunshine State teach¬ 
ing standards) to teachers. They are encouraged to use the materi¬ 
als in their classrooms and share them with other teachers within 
their districts. PEANT CAMP is an extensive four-day expense- 
paid training course; teachers must apply and are selected based on 
subjects taught, previous experience, letters of recommendation, 
and more. 

Graduate Students 

Dr. Atul Puri completed his doctoral program at the CAIP and 


has been working for DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware for sev¬ 
eral months. Graduate students Sushila Chaudhari and Court¬ 
ney Stokes have completed their M.S. degrees and moved into 
Ph.D. programs at North Carolina State and Cornell University, 
respectively. Sarah Berger (M.S.), Brett Bultemeier (Ph.D.), and 
Abhishek Mukherjee (Ph.D.) are finishing their degrees this sum¬ 
mer. Dr. Jeff Hutchinson completed his doctoral program and is 
now conducting research in a post-doctoral position with Dr. Ken 
Eangeland. 

New M.S. students include Eeif Willey from Indiana work¬ 
ing with Dr. Michael Netherland (Agronomy), and Kate Wilson, 
formerly of Washington State and Idaho, working with Dr. Tracy 
Irani in the Department of Agricultural Education and Communi¬ 
cation on natural resource communication and outreach.

in mid-summer. 


Other Accomplishments 

Amy Richard has taken the lead in representing the CAIP in de¬ 
veloping the role and mission of the newly formed North Ameri¬ 
can Invasive Species Network . The purpose of this network, 
which includes invasive species centers in Mexico and Canada, 
is to provide greater access to, and coordination of. North Ameri¬ 
can invasive species information and research activities. 

From a personal standpoint, our several years of research with 
new aquatic herbicides has paid off nicely in 2010-2011 with 
the U.S. Environment Protection Agency’s registration of fiumi- 
oxazin (Clipper'^^ and bispyribac-sodium (Tradewind'^^ from 
Valent Corporation. The registration of several new aquatic her¬ 
bicides in the past decade now provides us with several modes- 
of-action which will help in managing the potential development 
of herbicide-resistant populations of aquatic weeds.

Applications In Plant Invasions: 
From A Center Newcomer 


By Colette C. Jacono, Ph.D 


O n joining the Center in 2009, I might never have predicted 
the variety of problems and possibilities in plant invasions 
awaiting in Florida, nor imagined their broader-reaching effects on 
other beings and environments on our planet. Research projects in 
natural area wetlands have been my primary focus; however, the 
strong extension directive maintained by the Center has presented 
a wide conduit through which new invasion scenarios continue to 
be presented. 

Under a research grant from the South Florida Water Manage¬ 
ment District, the agency that oversees water resources in the 
southern half of Florida, we are using seed storage and greenhouse 
regeneration trials to understand the early life history processes 
crucial to the establishment and persistence of Tropical American 
watergrass (Luziola subintegra). Although Neotropical in origin, 
the endemic distribution of this “rice-related” species is not clear 
because, based on botanical records, it has moved significantly 
in recent decades in the greater Caribbean Basin. Since its 2007 
discovery in Florida, and despite a concerted regimen of herbi¬ 
cide treatment. Tropical American watergrass has spread in Lake 
Okeechobee, and invaded a restoration wetland on the eastern mar¬ 
gin of Everglades National Park. We are learning how hydrology 
interacts with seed survival in the soil and with seedling regenera¬ 
tion in the colonization of new sites. At the same time we are iden¬ 
tifying and monitoring the response of associated plant species at 
the Everglades site, in order to better guide restoration processes. 
These applied studies focused on providing immediate informa¬ 
tion needed by land managers to accurately predict population dy¬ 
namics in conjunction with their ongoing herbicide applications 
for management purposes. 



DNA “fingerprint" analysis was used to clarify the endemism of 
this water clover fern (MarsileaJ which was previously considered 
introduced in central Florida. 


Through research funding from the St. Johns River Water Man¬ 
agement District, the agency responsible for water resources in 
northeast and east-central Florida, we are refining an integrated 
approach for the long-term control of Wright’s nutrush {Scleria 
lacustris) in seasonal wetlands. Our aim is to deplete the extensive 
seed bank existing in marsh soils while preventing continued seed 


A Short-Term Retrospective 


production in recurring populations. By timing significantly re¬ 
duced herbicide dosage with plant growth stage, we can minimize 
non-target damage to native species while still achieving control of 
Wright’s nutrush. Our current recommendation was released this 
month as part of a fact sheet for resource managers thttp://edis. 
ifas.ufi.edu/ag352 T Such recommendations are based on extensive 
findings produced while I was with the United States Geological 
Survey and are detailed in the fact sheet. 

The St. Johns River District also sponsored the final leg in our 
collaborative project with the Florida Museum of Natural History 
on the taxonomy of water clover ferns (Marsilea). We utilized DNA 
sequencing of several plastid regions to “fingerprint” Marsilea spec¬ 
imens from around the world in order to provide an identification 
and source of origin for unknown plants that have been expanding 
at several locales in central Florida. Molecular sequencing was ex¬ 
pected to resolve not only the question of Marsilea's endemism, but 
also whether weed management or conservation protection should 
be employed. Our results concluded the specimens are an un¬ 
described species that is native in Florida and identical to a col¬ 
lection made over 100 years ago. Its return to the Emeralda Marsh 
Restoration Area could refiect the restoration of more natural hydro 
periods in the greater Eake Griffin ecosystem as its occurrence can 
be expected to increase following events that open the vegetative 
canopy and incorporate fiuctuation into surface waters. 

Several important invasion scenarios have arisen through Cen¬ 
ter extension, all of which bear broad-reaching impacts. Aroma 
(Dichrostachys cinerea subsp. africana) has now been found at 
multiple sites in the Florida Keys and in central Florida. A thorny, 
thicket-forming Old World legume. Aroma is internationally rec¬ 
ognized as a high-risk species for its invasive tendencies. In re¬ 
gions as near as Cuba, it is cited as an introduced weed of national 
significance. In Florida, two Cooperative Invasive Species Man¬ 
agement Areas (CISMAs) are willing to contribute labor to tackle 
the thorny thickets; nevertheless, it is anticipated that the CISMAs 
will fall short of an eradication goal. Aroma has broad climate and 
soil suitability, fixes nitrogen, tolerates mutilation, and re-sprouts 
from the base as well as from extensive root structures and seeds. 
Eittle is known about its invasion ecology and management pro¬ 
grams are non-existent. While our immediate efforts in obtaining 
grant funds for a Joint eradication/research program have failed, 
we hope that such an effort will be forthcoming. 

Applied science in the ecology of invasions is an increasingly 
pressing need as climates change and human exertions on the en¬ 
vironment become more severe. The discovery of science-based 
solutions for invasion management hinge on our ability to apply 
ecological approaches to understanding why species interact as 
they do with their introduced environment. I only hope that closed 
budgets and tight belts will not diffuse mankind’s responsibility 
for alleviating his heavy footprint in the realm of plant invasions.

Professor Ken Langeland at the Center for Aquatic & Invasive 
Plants, recently took a position with the U.S. Department of Agri¬ 
culture in Gainesville.

Clearing a Trail for the Next Generation 

By Amy Richard 


F or six years the UF/IFAS Center for Aquatic and Invasive 
Plants (CAIP) has been leading a concerted outreach effort for 
educators in Florida. The short-term goal of the Florida Invasive 
Plant Education Initiative is to raise awareness among upper el¬ 
ementary, middle, and high school teachers about invasive plants, 
and to inspire them to bring this important topic into their class¬ 
room and to fellow educators. The long-term goal is to bolster our 
next generation with tools and the desire to become responsible 
environmental stewards. 

Toward this end, UF/IFAS CAIP collaborated with dozens of 
teachers to develop curriculum about aquatic and upland invasive 
plants in Florida. Several audio-visual presentations and a host of 
learning materials have been developed for use in the classroom 
as a result. The on-going project has been made possible through 
a collaborative effort of CAIP and the Invasive Plant Management 
Section of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
(FWC). 



PLANT CAMP participants visit Lake TohopekaJiga (Toho) in Osceola 
County—a “quintessential ” multiple-use Florida waterbody that sup¬ 
ports eco-tourism (airboat and binding tours); bass fishing, and duck 
hunting, while also serving as a federal flood control project. The arrival 
of endangered snail kites a few years ago further complicated large- 
scale hydrilla management. The snail kites depend on an invasive apple 
snail for food, which in turn feeds on the invasive aquatic plant, hydrilla. 

A major component of the Education Initiative is an annual in¬ 
vasive plant teacher-training workshop, one of the first of its kind 
in the country, hosted by CAIP and FWC each June. The 5-day 
PLANT CAMP workshop includes field trips, rigorous hands-on 
plant identification activities, and classroom lectures—all designed 
to provide teachers with greater background knowledge and first¬ 
hand experience with large-scale invasive plant infestations. More 
than 160 teachers have been formally trained at these events. 

Recently, the CAIP outreach team developed an evaluation in¬ 
strument to determine the effectiveness of these efforts. In August 
2010, the survey was distributed among former participants to de¬ 


termine (1) if they are using their training and materials, and (2) 
if they experienced an increased awareness, understanding, and 
acceptance of the plant management practices they learned about 
during their training and use of materials. 



PLANT CAMP participants compete in a hands-on plant identification 
quiz to sharpen their observation and identification skills. 


The following highlights are encouraging: 

• Nearly 85% of respondents have been teaching their students 
about invasive plants since they received training, represent¬ 
ing a 47% gain from those who taught the subject before re¬ 
ceiving training. The same gain was achieved with regard to 
teachers training fellow teachers. 

• 98% of respondents agreed (i.e., “agree” and “strongly agree” 
combined) they are now more aware of the need to manage 
invasive plants. 

• Nearly 97% say the workshop made them more aware of the 
high financial costs of managing aquatic invasive plants. 

• As a result of their learning, 66% of respondents agreed (i.e., 
“agree” and “strongly agree” combined) the use of herbicides 
is necessary. 

• Even higher percentages of respondents agreed that biologi¬ 
cal, mechanical and physical control methods were neces¬ 
sary—over 83% for each. 

• More than 90% “strongly favored” and “somewhat favored” 
(combined) physical control methods. 

• Nearly 13% “strongly oppose” the use of chemical control. 

• Biological control and mechanical control both received fa¬ 
vorable responses from more than 85% of respondents. 

• PLANT CAMP graduates have trained or introduced the topic 
of invasive plants to an estimated 1,169 teacher-colleagues 
and an estimated 17,679 students as a result of these efforts.

Adding to the restoration toolbox: identifying widely 
adapted biotypes of eelgrass 


By Lyn Gettys, PhD 

adapted to the less-than-ideal conditions at many restoration sites 
to increase the likelihood of successful establishment of newly 
planted vegetation. 

Here at the Center, we are currently conducting a screen¬ 
ing program to identify biotypes (similar to botanical varieties) 
of eelgrass that tolerate and thrive in sediments with high levels 
of organic material and nutrients. Plants are grown under “com¬ 
mon nursery” conditions in sediment types ranging from pure 
sand to pure peat, and under nutrient levels ranging from none 
to high (4 g of controlled-release fertilizer per liter of sediment). 
We have evaluated plants from commercial sources and from a 
number of lakes throughout Florida where populations of eelgrass 
naturally occur. Some of these lakes have the sandy, nutrient-poor 
sediments typically preferred by eelgrass, but others have mucky, 
nutrient-rich sediments. We have thus far identified several bio¬ 
types of eelgrass that are highly productive regardless of sediment 
conditions. One of these biotypes is from a commercial source, 
but the others are field-collected plants from Florida lakes (includ¬ 
ing Lakes Seminole and Okahumpka) with the “hostile,” mucky, 
nutrient-rich conditions common at many lake restoration sites. 
These widely adapted biotypes of eelgrass may be very useful in 
lake restoration projects and give restoration managers another 
tool to increase revegetation success at sites where most eelgrass 
fails to establish. 

Lyn Gettys is a Research Assistant Scientist at the Center for 
Aquatic & Invasive Plants.

americana, in Lake Okeechobee, Florida.

lake a number of years ago but volunteer

M any lake restoration projects begin with the removal of inva¬ 
sive plants, muck, and accumulated detritus. The resulting 
habitat is often devoid of submersed aquatic vegetation, thereby 
lacking the underwater plant communities needed to provide 
ecosystem functions such as structure for fish and other aquatic 
animals. Therefore, an important part of many lake restoration 
projects is the introduction of native submersed plants. Most res¬ 
toration ecologists agree that the best plant material for these proj¬ 
ects is vegetation collected from areas near the restoration site. 
However, this is not always feasible for a number of reasons. For 
example, there may not be adequate source populations of suit¬ 
able plants near the restoration site, or conditions at nearby sites 
may be quite different from the lake targeted for restoration. As 
a result, it may be necessary to obtain plant material from other 
sources. 

Eelgrass {Vallisneria americana) is widely used in Florida lake 
restoration projects because the species is a native submersed pe¬ 
rennial plant that grows in water up to 10 feet deep. It also toler¬ 
ates a wide range of environmental conditions, including low light 
levels. The majority of naturally occurring populations of eelgrass 
are found in lakes with sandy, nutrient-poor sediments; however, 
many lakes targeted for restoration have sediments that are mucky 
and high in nutrients. A number of restoration projects have been 
unsuccessful because, despite significant inputs in labor and plant 
material, self-sustaining populations of eelgrass failed to become 
established. Therefore, it is important to use plant material that is

Glistening Carnivores—The Sticky-Leaved Insect-Eating Plants 

By Stewart McPherson. 2008. 392pp. ISBN 978-0-9558918-1-6. Redfern Natu¬ 
ral History Productions, www.redfernnaturalhistorv.com 

No less than 278 color photographs illustrate this unfettered book that describes 
the seven genera of sticky-leaved insect-eating plants {Byblis, Drosera, Droso- 
phyllum, Ibicella, Pinguicula, Roridula and Triphyophyllum). Ethnobotanical uses 
and botanical history are reported throughout, with extensive and numerous ex¬ 
cerpts from historical and modern sources, especially Charles Darwin, to whom 
the book is dedicated and whose work on insectivorous plants is documented in 
the first chapter. According to the author, Darwin’s “meticulous studies first estab¬ 
lished the carnivorous nature of Drosera and other sticky-leaved plants.” Other 
references provide such entertaining gems as “.. .much esteemed by medieval al¬ 
chemists and herbalists who claimed that it would burn off warts and excite lust in 
cattle.” Of particular interest was the story of Carolus Linnaeus who, upon receiv¬ 
ing a sketch of the trap of Dionaea muscipula together with plant material (1769), 
responded that the idea of an insect-eating plant was “.. .ridiculous and that it was 
contrary to the God-given rules of nature.” He reportedly referenced Genesis I, 
29-30 and declared the notion blasphemous. Charles Darwin published his own 
book. Insectivorous Plants, more than 100 years later (1875). Glistening Carni¬ 
vores reads like a personal journal of the daily explorations and nightly readings of 
a scientist singularly obsessed with these fascinating plants. And no wonder! 

A Guide to the Control and Management of Invasive Phrag- 
MiTES - Second Edition 

By B. Avers, R. Fahlsing, E. Kafcas, J. Schafer, et al. 2009. 38 pp. Michigan 
Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Available as a 



PDFfile from www. michWan. 20 v See DNR, Wildlife & Habitat, Plant Species. 


“An aggressive, nonnative variety of phragmites (Phragmites australis), also known as common reed, is threatening the ecological 
health of Michigan wetlands and coastal shorelines. This invasive variety of phragmites is becoming widespread throughout the Great 
Lakes and is displacing the native variety of the same species, as well as many other native plants.” The goal of this guide is to provide 
information about effective methods to control and manage Phragmites. Because the guide discusses tools that are not typically applied 
by the average landowner, it is intended primarily for land or resource managers from agencies, professional organizations, and busi¬ 
nesses; extension agents; or others in a similar profession. Control methods are described and include herbicide treatments, prescribed 
fire, mechanical treatment, and water level management (fiooding). Three management strategies are described, and long-term manage¬ 
ment and monitoring are discussed. 


A Book of Reed {Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel, Eormerly Phragmites communis Trin.) 
By S.M. Haslam. 2010. 261 pp. ISBN 978-0-9564692-0-5. Forrest Text, Cardigan, UK. 


This esteemed author considers common reed a remarkable plant and thoroughly explores its life history, pattern and growth, genetic 
and clonal variations, and physical and economic impacts. We are told that “Because of its cosmopolitan distribution, its fascinating 
biology, its uses to people and its responses to so many habitat factors, Phragmites is indeed a plant worth studying and reading about.” 
This book is your opportunity to do Just that. 


A Selection of Plants for Greening of Waterways and Waterbodies in the Tropics 


ByJ.W.H. Yong, TP. Yok, N.H. Hassan, and TS. Ngin (eds.) 2010. 480pp. ISBN 978-981-08-5086-9. National Parks Board, Nanyang 
Technological University, Public Utilities Board, Singapore. 


This book is a practical guide to using aquatic plants in urban settings, including landscaped ponds, planted edges of stormwater sedi¬ 
mentation basins, naturalisation of canals and river banks, constructed wetlands, “cleansing biotopes” and floating vegetated islands in 
reservoirs or waterways. The book is luxuriantly illustrated with color photographs of the various applications for greening waterways 
and waterbodies, and of the 114 plants selected and grouped by type (rheophytes, floaters, floating-leaf plants, submerged and emergent 
plants, and mangroves and other plants of coastal habitats). It aims to reach a diverse audience, including urban planners, hydrological 
engineers, architects, landscape designers, and horticulturists. The book is part of a larger effort to develop a “Periodic Table of Plants” 
that will serve as a reference to plants best suited to absorbing chemical elements or compounds from the environment. Where pollutant 
uptake (phytoremediation) capacity for specific plants is known, the relevant information has been included in the plant descriptions.

The Global Diversity of Taro—Ethnobotany and Conservation 


By V. Ramanatha Rao, P. J. Matthews, P. B. Eyzaguirre and D. Hunter (editors) 
This book begins with a consideration of taro’s history as a food and then travels 
from Ghana, through Indonesia, Vietnam, China and Cuba, finally finishing up 
in the Pacific Region. Taro is one of the world’s oldest food crops, dating back 
over 9,000 years. First domesticated in Southeast Asia, it has spread throughout 
the world and is now an important crop in Asia, Pacific, Africa and the Carib¬ 
bean. Farmers and communities have depended on taro cultivation to meet their 
daily needs for millennia and have nurtured and adapted the crop. However, they 
face many risks because of taro’s vulnerability to biotic and abiotic problems, 
and global climate change. Worldwide, taro ranks fourteenth among staple veg¬ 
etable crops with approximately 12 million tons produced globally from about 2 
million hectares, with an average yield of 6.5 t/ha. (FAOSTAT 2010 estimates). 
Taro is also a sacred plant in many cultures, with high prestige and strong cultural 
and symbolic importance. This book on taro is among the first to offer a global 
approach, covering all regions, disciplinary perspectives and uses of the plant. 
Contributors from different disciplines and geographic regions offer a multidis¬ 
ciplinary and evolutionary perspective on taro that shows how one of the world’s 
oldest domesticated plant species continues to evolve and acquire new uses. The 
book also demonstrates how the story of taro can serve as a model for the in situ 
conservation and use of a staple crop whose global importance is evidenced at the

Cryptocoryne of Peninsular Malaysia 

ByA.S. Othman, N. Jacobsen, andM. Mansor. 2009. 102pp. ISBN978-983-861-377-8 (hard cover), -4 (soft cover). University Sains 
Malaysia Press, Pulau Pinang. 

“The aquatic and amphibious genus Cryptocoryne, popularly known as Water Trumpet, is a very characteristic plant component when 
you visit the forest streams in Peninsular Malaysia, where each species in shape, size, and fiowering is adapted to exactly those circum¬ 
stances under which it is found in the forests. The ultimate experience is when you explore the forests and come upon a stream which which 
is fully covered with leaves of a Cryptocoryne species.... The book is the result of many years of research and cooperation regarding the 
Water Trumpets of Peninsular Malaysia.” These charismatic plants are popular among aquarium enthusiasts due to the variable shapes and 
attractive colors of their foliage. They are entomophilous (pollinated by insects), with male and female fiowers hidden within a “kettle”. 
Chapters include an overview of the genus, morphology and cytology, evolution of the genus (using evidence from chromosome numbers 
and molecular DNA analysis), and systematic treatment, as well as a discussion of the conservation needs for each species. Although some 
photographs are less than sharp, the book is nicely illustrated overall with color images of the species. 


NEW JOURNAL 

Inland Waters: Journal of the International Society of Limnology is a new, international, peer-reviewed journal for original papers 
that advance our understanding of inland aquatic ecosystems and their management. 

Inland Waters replaces the SIL (International Society of Limnology [formerly International Association of Theoretical and Ap¬ 
plied Limnology; Societas Internationalis Limnologiae, SIL]) Proceedings (Verhandlungen), but will remain as faithful as possible, 
with encouragement of a worldwide set of authors and short (except for papers arising from named and plenary talks at Congresses), 
rapidly-published papers. The scope of the journal includes all aspects of physical, chemical, and biological limnology, as well as 
applied and regional limnology. Publication in the journal is not restricted to SIL members. 

Inland Waters is an “online first” journal, publishing papers online as they are accepted, and then in four print issues per year. The 
first issue was published in April 2011. The journal is available through membership of SIL, with free online access to SIL members, 
and by subscription. Visit www.limnologv.org

Blanco, S. & Ector, L. (2009) Distribution, ecology and nui¬ 
sance effects of the freshwater invasive diatom Didymosphe- 
nia geminata (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt: a literature review. 
Nova Hedwigia 88:347-422 

Didymo, short for Didymosphenia geminata, is an invasive 
microalgae with massive proliferation, which forms conspicu¬ 
ous growths in streams. In this bibliographic study, accord¬ 
ing to Blanco and Ector, “a near exhaustive investigation was 
performed in the scientific literature, phycological inventories, 
technical reports and internet databases” to account for present 
records. “This paper investigates the historic and current bio¬ 
geographic range of this invasive species (and varieties) based 
on 1,000 citations collected mainly from the scientific literature. 
The locations where this diatom has appeared, including both 
fossil and recent records, are presented in world distribution 
maps. Our results confirm that the native range of D. geminata 
is almost restricted to the Holarctic region, though its distribu¬ 
tion area is broader than usually reported in the literature. The 
ecological profile of this alga, along with its nuisance effects, is 
also discussed.” 

Chaplin, G.I & Valentine, J.F. (2009) Macroinvertebrate Pro¬ 
duction in the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation of the Mobile- 
Tensaw Delta: Effects of an Exotic Species at the Base of an 
Estuarine Food Web. Estuaries and Coasts 32(2):319-332 

Chaplin and Valentine report the first estimates of the effects 
of the proliferation of Myriophyllum spicatum, an exotic sub¬ 
merged aquatic vegetation (SAV) species, on macroinvertebrate 
production in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, a tidally infiuenced es¬ 
tuary of the northern Gulf of Mexico. They do this by compar¬ 
ing the secondary production occurring on two native SAV spe¬ 
cies, Heteranthera dubia and Vallisneria americana. 

Annual macroinvertebrate production of crustaceans, gastro¬ 
pods, bivalves and insect larvae on these three dominant SAV 
species was estimated. Production was greatest on M. spicatum 
and H. dubia and least on V. americana, however, the research¬ 
ers report that the production on M. spicatum was three times 
greater than on either of the two native SAV species. 

Regarding this high productivity on a non-native plant, the 
authors say, “From this limited comparison made within a single 
trophic level, it could be argued that the spread of M. spicatum 
within the Mobile-Tensaw Delta is one example of an exotic 
species benefiting an open coastal ecosystem...we believe that 
assessments of the impacts of exotic SAV species on coastal 
food webs, including our own, remain too simple and that there 
is a need to make these assessments from a broader perspec¬ 
tive.” 

The authors conclude: Based on no-choice palatability tests, 
it is probable that the high production within the structurally 
complex M spicatum and H. dubia was the result of reduced 
predator foraging efficiency. Thus, they contend that “it is pre¬ 
mature to conclude that the extraordinary production measured 
on M. spicatum is responsible for the persistence of higher order 
consumers in the Delta food web.” 


Coates, C. (2009) Aquatic Plants Surviving in the Acidic Lakes 
of the Ocala National Forest. Aquatics 31(2): 15-16 

The Ocala National Forest sits atop ancient sand dunes that 
played a key role in the development of 600+ highly acidic lakes 
that are unique to this national forest. Coates states, “... the lakes 
with pH ranges between 4.1 and 4.4 are of particular interest and 
have been classified by the Forest Service as highly acidic.” Fakes 
Clay, Gobbler, Mary and Fawbreaker have pH values of 4.4, 4.1, 
4.4 and 4.3, respectively. Factors contributing to the acidity of the 
lakes include surface water as the sole source of recharge; three of 
the lakes are seepage lakes with no stream flow into or out of them; 
and, lack of natural buffering. 

One effect of the acidic water is to slow the decomposition rate 
of organic matter, reducing nutrients available for plants. None¬ 
theless, according to Coates, “In the lakes of the Ocala Nation¬ 
al Forest aquatic plants survive and even thrive in these highly 
acidic conditions,” including Fuirena scirpoidea (rush fuirena), 
Leersia hexandra (southern cut grass), Nuphar luteum (spatter- 
dock), Utriculariafloridana (Florida yellow bladderwort), Utricu- 
laria purpurea (eastern purple bladderwort), Panicum hemitomon 
(maidencane), Nymphaea odorata (fragrant water lily), and Web¬ 
ster ia confervoides (algal bulrush). 

The author says further questions remain: Are the pH levels in 
these lakes stable or are the levels slowly decreasing? If they are 
decreasing, what are the implications? When the pH level in a lake 
reaches 4.3 or lower, aquatic plant coverage and species diversity 
appear to decline. If that is the case, at what pH level does aquatic 
plant life disappear? Will the lakes of the Ocala National Forest 
ever reach that point? 

Meyerson, L.A, Voila, D.V., & Brown, R.N. (2010) Hybridiza¬ 
tion of Invasive Phragmites australis with a Native Snbspecies 
in North America. Biol. Invasions 12(1): 103-111 

Both native and introduced lineages of Phragmites australis oc¬ 
cur in North America so there is an excellent opportunity to in¬ 
vestigate intraspecific hybridization. According to Meyerson et af, 
“The major goals of this research were to demonstrate coincident 
flowering phenologies of multiple populations of native and intro¬ 
duced Phragmites collected from a broad geographic range and to 
prove that hybridization between the native and introduced strains 
of P. australis was indeed possible.” 

The authors report for the first time in this article, “that native 
and introduced populations of Phragmites can hybridize. There is 
substantial overlap in flowering period between native and intro¬ 
duced populations from the same geographic locations.” 

Their “data demonstrates the ability of the native and introduced 
lineages to interbreed, but successful crosses were highly depen¬ 
dent on the identities of the parent populations. Furthermore, only 
crosses with introduced Phragmites pollen donors and native re¬ 
cipients exhibited seed set, suggesting gene flow is unidirection¬ 
al.” Nonetheless the concern is, “If hybridization is occurring in 
the field, it will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the native 
subspecies through genetic swamping and, potentially, through in¬ 
creased competition if hybrids exhibit increased vigor.”

Joyeux, M., Vincent, O. & Marmottan, P. (2011) Mechanical 
Model of the Ultrafast Underwater Trap of Utricularia. Physi¬ 
cal Review E83, 021911 

Joyeux et al. offer a fascinating look at the mechanism enabling 
the underwater traps (bladderlike organs) of bladderworts to catch 
their prey. The model they propose combines two phases: repeti¬ 
tion of an “active slow deflation followed by passive fast suction” 
sequence. 

During the first, slow step, the door is indeed closed and the con¬ 
cave wall curvature, due to the lower internal pressure, results in 
elastic energy being stored in the walls. The second, ultrafast step 
begins when a potential prey touches one of the trigger hairs and 
is engulfed when the walls of the trap release the stored energy. 
Both experimental results and theoretical models are presented in 
an effort to understand this mechanism. A combination of high¬ 
speed video imaging, scanning electron microscopy, light-sheet 
fluorescence microscopy, particle tracking, and molecular dynam¬ 
ics simulations was used to visualize the motion of the door and 
propose a plausible mechanism. 

The authors propose a mechanical model that describes both 
phases and strongly supports the hypothesis that the trap door 
acts as a flexible valve that buckles under the combined effects 
of pressure forces and the mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs, 
and not as a panel articulated on hinges. 

Nesom, G.U. (2009) Assessment of Invasiveness and Ecological 
Impact in Non-Native Plants of Texas. J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas 
3(2):971-991 

Nesom’s method, titled “Fundamental Invasiveness Index”, 
serves as a framework for assessment and ranking of each of 
the non-native species of Texas according to their invasiveness 
and ecological impact. The Index is based on knowledge of the 
species from held, herbarium, and literature, according to four 
criteria: 

FI: Invasive in both disturbed and natural habitats, negatively 
affecting native species or natural biodiversity by altering native 
vegetation and habitats or by outcompeting or hybridizing with 
native species; or, invasive into agricultural habitats and causing 
significant economic damage; including woody, herbaceous, and 
aquatic species. 

F2: Abundant in number and widespread; commonly invasive 
in disturbed habitats, much less commonly in natural habitats; 
subdivided into woody, herbaceous, and aquatic species. 

F3: Relatively few in number, known from relatively few lo¬ 
calities, usually in disturbed habitats; subdivided into woody and 
herbaceous species. 

F4: Status unknown. 

The 812 non-native species growing outside of cultivation in 
Texas have been documented. A preliminary list of non-native 
species in Texas was developed by the author from the USDA 
PLANTS Database. Journals and other literature were reviewed 
for possible additions, and, he notes, a number of species were 
excluded. “Only plants that are naturalized have been included 
in the assessment.” Nesom’s method “emphasizes simplicity, al¬ 
lowing assessment of the large number of non-native species (all 
that are known to occur in the state).” Of the entire list, 25 are 
aquatic (9 classified as FI, 16 classified as F2). Four Appendices 
list the plants and their rankings, including a Watch List with 


a section of “Potential and expanding new arrivals with global 
warming in south and coastal Texas.” 

Pemberton, R.W. & Bodle, M.J. (2009) Native North Ameri¬ 
can Azolla Weevil, Stenopelmus rufinasus (Coleoptera: Curcu- 
lionidae). Uses the Invasive Old Azollapinnata as a Host 

Plant. FI. Entomol. 92(1): 153-155 

Azolla pinnata, a tiny aquatic fern native to a large area of the 
tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate regions of Africa, Asia, 
and Australia, was found to be naturalized in waterways of south¬ 
ern Florida near Jupiter, in May 2007, by Bodle. The fern is classi¬ 
fied as a Federal Noxious Weed and was found to be naturalized in 
North Carolina in 1999, where it continues to persist. 

Pemberton and Bodle contend that “because of the difficulty in 
eradicating A. pinnata, it is prudent to consider other potential con¬ 
trol approaches. Biological control appears feasible for a number 
of reasons.” Two insect herbivores are Azolla specialists in North 
America: one is a flea beetle, Pseudolampsis guttata (LeConte), 
occurring in the eastern U.S. and using A. caroliniana as its host 
plant; the other is a weevil, Stenopelmus rufinasus Gyllenhal, oc¬ 
curring in the western and southern U.S. 

According to the summary, the native weevil, Stenopelmus ru¬ 
finasus, a specialist herbivore on North American mosquito ferns 
(Azolla spp.), has adopted Azolla pinnata, an incipient invasive 
weed in Florida from the Old World. This situation, in which a 
weed has invaded the native area of a successful biological control 
agent of a congeneric weed in another region, is unique. Should 
A. pinnata escape eradication, S. rufinasus may prove useful as a 
control agent.

es in a Pond Ecosystem cansed by Grass Carp (Ctenopharyn- 
godon idella Val.) Low Stocking Density. Czech J. Animal Sci. 
54(l):31-45 

Pipalova, Kvet and Adamek looked at direct and indirect con¬ 
sequences of stocking a pond with grass carp. No previous stud¬ 
ies used real control ponds. The purpose of this experiment “was 
to identify (1) changes in nutrient concentrations particularly 
of phosphorous and nitrogen in the water and sediment; and (2) 
changes in phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos biomass 
and abundance after a moderate stocking rate of grass carp in a 
small and shallow pond.” 

The study was conducted at the experimental facility of the Re¬ 
search Institute of Fish Culture and Hydrobiology in the Czech 
Republic, from 1998 to 2000. Direct consequences of grass carp 
stocking on the biomass of aquatic macrophytes was measured in 
a pond, resulting in the biomass of Cladophora globulina, Eleo- 
charis acicularis and Potamogeton pusillus being significantly 
decreased. Cladophora biomass was impacted the most. Indirect 
consequences of grass carp stocking on water chemistry were lim¬ 
ited, with only the concentration of nitrogen increasing significant¬ 
ly. This was also true of sediment nutrients. The authors conclude 
that “the changes in water and sediment chemistry were greater in 
the pond without grass carp due to the presence and subsequent 
dieoff of the filamentous alga Cladophora globulina and thus the 
changes caused by grass carp stocking were not statistically sig¬ 
nificant.”
