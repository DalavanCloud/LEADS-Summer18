PREFACE. 



The general utility of Horticulture, or the art of improv- 
ing every kind of soil; of producing a plentiful supply oi 
wholesome vegetables and fruits, so necessary to health in all 
countries, especially in warm climates; of cultivating the 
various plants designed by infinite goodness to minister to 
the comforts of animal life, by correcting the divers maladies 
to which it is subject by nature, and still more so, in the human 
race, by intemperance; of raising many articles of luxury and 
commerce, as well as materials for ornamenting the whole face 
of the country — is too obvious to render any arguments neces- 
sary in favour of an attempt to facilitate the general acquisition 
of that useful branch of knowledge; but more especially, in a 
country which has not yet made that rapid progress in Gar- 
dening, ornamental planting, and fanciful rural designs, which 
might naturally be expected from an intelligent, happy and 
independent people, possessed so universally of landed property, 
unoppressed by taxation or tithes, and blessed with consequent 
comfort and affluence. 

The neglect in these respects is, no doubt, to be attributed 
to various causes, among the most prominent of which is the 
necessity of having reference for information on those subjects 
to works published in foreign countries, and adapted to climates 
by no means according with ours, either in the temperature or 
course of the seasons, and in numerous instances differing 
materially in modes of culture from those rendered necessary 
here by the peculiarities of our climates, soils and situations. 
And however excellent and useful these works are in the 
regions to which they are adapted, they tend to mislead and 
disappoint the young Jimerican Horticulturist, instead of 



yj_ PREFACE. 

affording him that correct, judicious and suitable instruction, 
the happy result of which would give impulse to his perse- 
verance. 

To obviate this necessity, as much as is in my power, and to 
contribute my mite to the welfare of my fellow citizens, and 
to the general improvement of the country, I have undertaken 
this work, and arranged the matter according to the seasons of 
the year, that the reader may have an easy reference to the 
particular business to be performed in every month. By this 
means the subject becomes a daily amusement and study, 
applicable at the moment, and consequently leaving a lasting 
impression on the memory; which, if attended to for a few 
years, may make any person who has a taste for admiring and 
enjoying the magnificence, beauties and bounties of Nature in 
its vegetable productions, a complete Master of the Art, and if 
he pleases, his own Gardener. 

In writing this treatise, I have had recourse to the best pub- 
lications, American, English, French and Latin, lest any useful 
suggestions or modern improvements in the art should escape 
my notice or recollection; still keeping in view, not only the 
difference of climate, season, and the necessary modes of cul- 
ture in foreign countries, but also in the extensive region of 
which the United States are composed. It is, however, prob- 
able, notwithstanding all my assiduity and care in collecting 
as much information as possible with respect to the most proper 
seaso7is for sowing particular kinds of seeds, &c. in the remote 
parts of the Union, that I have fallen into some mistakes; for 
these, as well as typographical errors, to which a work of this 
kind is unavoidably subject, I solicit the reader's excuse; and 
shall consider myself under serious obligations to those whose 
personal friendship or patriotism shall induce them to inform 
me of any horticultural errors which I may have committed 
or improvements that may be made, in order that the former 
be corrected, and the latter, if justified by experience, published 
in some future work, or edition of this. 

The culture and management of Grape-Vines, and all other 
kinds of fruit trees which can be cultivated with us to advan- 
tage, or even to indulge curiosity; the raising and planting of 
Thorn Quicks and other plants suitable for Live Hedges; the

Paper Mulberry, Mulberry-trees for feeding Silk-worms, (and

which appeared to me of sufficient importance, either in a 
commercial, manufacturing, or ornamental point of view, or as 
affording any of the luxuries or necessaries of life, have been 
treated of with due attention: and in order to accommodate the 
Agriculturist, I have given a classical catalogue of the most 
important and valuable grasses and other plants used in rural 
economy; and likewise pointed out the particular kind of soil, 
in which each plant cultivated as a grass, or exclusively on 
account of its foliage, has been found, upon repeated trials, to 
succeed best. 

From an experience which I have had of near thirty years 
in PRACTICAL GARDENING, on a general and extensive scale; 
the particular pains which I have taken, not only to designate 
the necessary work of every month, but also the best methods 
of performing it; the avoiding of all unnecessary repetitions, 
so frequent in works of the kind, in order to render it as full 
of important matter as possible; the assiduous endeavours to 
make it useful in every state of the Union, and to induce an 
association of the science of Botany with practical horticulture, 
without which the latter can never be so advantageously con- 
ducted; it is hoped that this will be found to be the most useful 
and valuable Gardener's Calendar hitherto published in 
any country, but more particularly so to the citizens of the 
United States, for whose use it has been written, and to whom 
it is respectfully inscribed by the Author.

JANUARY. 



WORK TO BE DONE IN THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 



Preparations for Early Crops. 

In such parts of the Union where the ground is not at this time 
bound up with frost, continue to dig the waste quarters of your 
kitchen garden, first giving them such manure as thej require; lay- 
ing them in high sloping ridges, to sweeten and be improved by the 
frost, &c., more especially if the soil be of a stift" nature; by which 
method, its adhesion is destroyed, the pores are opened for the 
admission of air, frost, rain and dews, all of which abounding with 
nitrous salts, contribute, in a high degree, towards its melioration 
and fertility; and besides a great quantity of ground thus prepared, 
can be soon levelled in the spring for sowing or planting; which, if 
neglected, would require much time to dig in a proper manner, and 
that at a period when the throng of business requires every advan- 
tage of previous preparation. 

When the ground at this time is frozen so hard as not to be dug, 
which is generally the case in the middle and eastern states, you 
may carry manure into the different quarters and spread it, repair 
fences, rub out and clean your seeds, prepare shreds, nails and twigs, 
for the wall and espalier trees, which are to be pruned in this and 
the next month; get all the garden-tools in repair, and procure 
such as are wanting; provide from the woods a sufficient quantity 
of pea-rods, and poles for your Lima and other running beans; 
dress and point them, so as to be ready for use when wanted. 

Here it may be well to remark, that many people who neglect to 
provide themselves with pea-rods at this season, when it can be so 
conveniently done, are necessitated, when the hurry of business over- 
takes them in spring, to sow their peas and let them trail on the 
B 



IQ THE KITCHEN GARDEN. [Jan. 

ground^ in which situation they will never produce, especially the 
tall growing kinds, one third as many as if they were properly 
rodded. 

The various kinds of Early-Hotspur Peas will require I'ods from 
four to five feet high; the Marrowfat, Glory of England, White and 
Green Rouncival, Spanish Morotto, and other tall growing kinds, 
will require them to be from six to seven feet high, exclusive of 
the part to be inserted in the earth; they ought to be formed or 
dressed fan-fashion, the lower ends pointed, for the ease of pushing 
them into the earth, and laid by, either under some shed, or in any 
convenient place, till wanted; one set of rods will, with care, last for 
three years. The same kind of rods that the tall growing peas re- 
quire, will answer for the generality of running Kidney Beans; the 
Lima-Beans require strong poles from eight to nine feet high. 

If in this, and the next month, you neglect forwarding every thing 
that can possibly be done, in and for the garden, you will materially 
find the loss of such inattention, when the hurry and pressure of 
spring business overtake you. Every active and well inclined 
gardener will find abundant employment in the various departments 
of the garden at this season, and need not be idle, if disposed to be 
industrious, or to serve either himself or his employer. 

Fraining. 

Many will think that the instructions hereafter given for the 
raising of early Cucumbers and Melons, in frames, are too diffuse; 
especially in a country which abounds in these kinds of fruit, pro- 
duced in such quantities, in summer and autumn, without artificial 
heat, or very much trouble. 

The remark may be just, but the principal motive forgiving these 
lengthy instructions is, to exercise the young gardener in the art 
of managing Garden-Frames in general; an art absolutely essen- 
tial to every good Gardener, and which cannot be better exemplified 
than in the raising of early Cucumbers and Melons. And besides 
these fruits coming into use at an early season, will be much valued 
and esteemed. 

As several other kinds of kitchen-garden vegetables are desirable 
at an early season, such as cresses, rape, lettuce, mustard, radishes, 
&c., to cut while young; asparagus, radishes, peas, kidney beans, 
&c., to be forwarded in early perfection; cauliflower and cabbage 
plants, to succeed those sown in September, and to produce a prin- 
cipal crop for early summer use; you should now provide the ne- 
cessary supplies of hot stable dung, rich earth, and other requisites 
proper for their cultivation in hot beds, as explained for each, under 
its respective head. 

Hot-bed Frames and Lights. 

If not already provided with hot-bed frames and lights, you may 
get them made agreeably to the following instructions. Large 
frames ought to be made of inch and half, or rather two inch plank. 



Jan.] the kitchen garden. jj 

of the best yellow pine, nine feet two inches long, four feet ten inches 
wide, as high again in the back as in the front, to give the top a due 
slope to the sun and a proper declivity to carry off the wet when 
covered with glass lights, to move off and on occasionally; every 
joint ought to be tongued, the better to prevent the admission of 
cold air into, or emission of warm air out of the bed, but in such 
manner as the Gardener may think proper. The back and front 
are to be nailed to corner posts, so as to admit the ends to fit in 
neatly, which ends are to be made fast to the posts by iron bolts 
keyed in the inside, for the greater facility of taking the frame 
asunder when necessary; each end must be made one inch and a 
half higher than the back and front, so as that one half its thickness 
may be grooved out on the inside, for the sash to rest and slide on, 
and the other half left for its support on the outside; when finished 
give it two or three good coats of paint before you use it, and with 
a little care and an annual painting, it may last you twenty years. 

These frames will take three lights of three feet wide each, each 
light containing five rows of glass panes, six inches by four, over- 
lapping one another about half an inch, which of all other 
sizes is the most preferable, on account of their cheapness in the 
first place, the closeness of their lap, their general strength and 
trifling expense of repairs; however, each person will suit his own 
convenience as to the dimensions of glass. Where the sashes when 
laid on the frame meet, a piece of pine about three and a half inches 
broad and near two thick, should run from back to front, morticed 
into each, for their support, and for them to slide on; in the centre 
of which, as well as in the ends of the frame, it will be well to make 
a groove five-eighths of an inch wide and near a quarter of an inch 
deep, rounded at bottom to receive and carry off any wet which may 
work down between the sashes. 

But with respect to particular dimensions of frames, they are dif- 
ferent, according to the plants they are intended to protect, but ge- 
nerally from nine to twelve feet long, from four feet eight inches to 
five feet wide, from eighteen inches to three feet six inches high in 
the back, and from nine to eighteen inches in front, being for the 
most part twice as high in the back as in front, if not more. 

The common kitchen garden frames may be of three different 
sizes, that is, for one, two and three lights; the latter of which, how- 
ever, are the most material, and which are employed for general 
use: but it is necessary also to have one and two light frames, the 
former as seedling frames, and the latter as succession or nursery 
frames, to forward the young plants to a due size for the three-light 
frames, in which they are to fruit. 

Early Cucumbers and Melons. 

As it is generally the ambition of most gardeners to excel each 
other in the production of early cucumbers, &c.,all necessary pre- 
paration should be made this month for that purpose, by preparing 
dung for hot-beds, in which to raise the plants; for they, being of a 
tender quality, require the aid of artificial heat under shelter of 



J 2 THE KITCHEN GAilDEN. [Jan. 

frames and glasses, until the middle or latter end of May, especially 
in the middle and eastern states. 

But by the aid of hot-beds, defended with frames and glasses, we 
obtain early cucumbers, in young green fruit, fit to cut or gather in 
February, March and April, &c., and ripe melons in May and June. 
The proper sorts of cucumbers for the early crops are the early 
short prickly, and long green prickly; of which the first sort comes 
earliest; but the latter is considerably the finest fruit, and greatly 
preferable for general culture. 

And if early melons are also required, there are several varieties 
of the fruit: the Cantaleupe is one of the best for its handsome 
growth, good size, and superior flavour; and is in much estimation. 

The true Cantaleupe or Armenian warted Melon, is very scarce in 
the United States; its fruit is large, roundish and deeply ribbed, a 
little compressed at both ends, the surface full of warted protube- 
rances, like some species of squash, the flesh reddish, firm, and of 
a most delicious rich flavour; of which there are several varieties, 
dittering principally in colour, and commonly called black rock, 
golden rock, &c. 

This variety of melon derives the term Cantaleupe, from a place 
of that name near Rome, where it was first cultivated in Europe — 
brought thence from Armenia, a country of Asia, in which is situ- 
ated the famous Mount Ararat. 

But it may also be proper to raise some of the others for variety; 
the Romana is a great bearer, comes early, but the fruit much 
smaller, though well flavoured; the Polignac, Nutmeg and Minorca 
are also fine melons; but it may also be eligible to raise two, three, 
or more of the best approved different sorts. 

Observe, that in procuring these seeds for immediate sowing, both 
of cucumbers and melons, it is adviseable to have those of two, three 
or four years old, if possible, as the plants will generally show fruit 
sooner, as well as prove more fruitful than those of new seeds, which 
are apt to run vigorously to vine, often advancing in considerable 
length before they show a single fruit; but when seeds of this age 
cannot be procured, new seeds may be improved by carrying them 
a few weeks previous to sowing in your waistcoat or breeches 
pocket. 

In order to raise early cucumbers and melons, you must provide 
a quantity of fresh hot stable-dung, wherewith to make a small 
hot-bed for a seed-bed, in which to raise the plants to a proper 
growth for transplanting into larger hot-beds next month to remain 
to fruit; for this purpose a small bed for a one or two light frame 
may be sufficient, in which case two cartloads of hot dung will be 
enough for making a bed of proper dimensions for a one-light box, 
and so in proportion for a larger. 

Agreeably to these intimations, provide the requisite supply of 
good horse-stable-dung from the dung hills in stable-yards, &c., con- 
sisting of that formed of the moist stable litter and dunging of the 
horses together, choosing that which is moderately fresh, moist, and 
full of heat — always preferring that which is of some lively, warm, 
steamy quality; and of which take the long and short together as it 



Jan.] the KITCHEN GARDEN. J3 

occurs, in proper quantity as above. And being thus procured, 
proceed to making the hot-bed, or previously to forming it into a 
bed, if the dung is rank, it would be proper to prepare it a little to 
an improved state, more successful for that purpose, by forking the 
whole up into a heap, mixing it well together, and let it thus remain 
eight or ten days to ferment equally, and for the rank steam and 
fierce heat to transpire, or evaporate in some effectual degree; and 
by which time it will have acquired a proper temperament for 
making into a hot-bed, by which treatment the heat will be steady 
and lasting, and not so liable to become violent or burning, as 
when the dung is not previously prepared. 

Choose a place on which to make your hot-bed, in a sheltered dry 
part of the framing ground,* &c. open to the morning and south 
sun; and it maybe made either wholly on the surface of the ground, 
or in a shallow trench, of from six to twelve inches deep, and four 
or five feet wide, according to the frame; but if made entirely on 
the surface, which is generally the most eligible method at this early 
season, it affords the opportunity of lining the sides of the bed with 
fresh hot dung, quite down to the bottom, to augment the heat when 
it declines, and also prevents wet from settling about the bottom 
of the bed, as often happens when made in a trench, which chills 
the dung, and causes the heat soon to decay. 

Then according to the size of the frame, mark out the dimen- 
sions of the bed, either on the ground, or with four stakes, making 
an allowance for it to be about four or five inches wider than the 
frame each way; this done, begin to make the bed accordingly, ob- 
serving to shake and mix the dung well, as you lay it on the bed, 
and beat it down with the back of the fork as you go on: but I 
would not advise treading it, for a bed which is trodden hard 
will not work so kindly, and be more liable to burn that which 
is suffered to settle gradually of itself: in this manner proceed 
till the bed has arrived at the height of four feet, which will not 
be too much; making an allowance for its settling six or eight 
inches, or more, in a week or fortnight's time; and as soon as 
finished, let the frame and glass be put on: keep them close till 
the heat comes up, then raise the glass behind that the steam may 
pass away. 

The next thing to be observed, is about earthing the bed, in which 
to sow the seed; and for which occasion, should have a proper sup- 
ply of rich, light, dry earth, or compost, ready at this season, under 
some airy dry shed, or hovel, covered at top to keep out rain, that 
the earth may be properly dry; for if too moist or wet at this time, 
it would prove greatly detrimental both to the growth of the seed and 
young plants, as well as be very apt to cake and burn at bottom next 
the dung, by the strong heat of the bed: therefore, observing, that 
for early hot-beds of cucumbers and melons, should generally depo- 

* Framing Ground is a part of the Kitchen Garden, well defended from 
cutting winds, and well exposed to the sun; particularly intended for 
framing of all kinds, and generally enclosed with live or reed hedges, or 
board fences, the former being the most preferable. 



14 THE KITCHEN GARDEN. [Jan. 

sit a necessary quantity of proper earth, under some cover as above, 
either the beginning of winter, or at least a fortnight or three or 
four weeks previous to making the hot-bed, in order to have it in 
the dry, mellow state above mentioned, ready for immediate use 
when wanted. 

Three or four days after the bed is made, prepare to earth itj 
previously observing, if it has settled unequally, to take off the 
frame and glasses, and level any inequalities^ make the surface 
smooth, put on the frame again, and then lay therein as much of 
the above mentioned earth as will cover the whole top surface of 
the bed, about three or four inches thick, then fill two, three, or 
more middling smallish garden-pots with more of the aforesaid rich 
earth, place them within the frame on the hot-bed, put on the glass 
or glasses, and continue them till the earth in the pots is warm; 
and when that is effected, sow the seeds in the pots, both of cucum- 
bers and melons, each separately, more or less in each pot, accord- 
ing to the quantity of plants required; but generally considerably 
more of cucumbers than of melons at this season, covering in the 
seeds near half an inch deep with the same earth. 

This done, place the pots towards the middle of the bed, plunging 
the bottom part a little into the earth, drawing some of the same up 
round each pot at the same time; or in two or three days after, may 
sow a few seeds in the earth of the bed, to have a chance both ways; 
but by sowing in pots, if the beds should heat too violently, as is 
sometimes unavoidably the case, the pots can be readily drawn up 
more or less, out of danger of burning the earth, &c. therein; and 
thus, the sowing in pots in a new made hot-bed in full heat may 
prove of greater advantage than sowing in the earth of the bed, with 
regard to more probable safety from burning. 

After sowing the seeds, put on the lights or glasses close; but 
when the steam from the heat of the bed rises copiously, give it 
vent by raising one corner of the upper ends of the lights, half an 
inch or an inch, which is also necessary in order to prevent any 
burning tendency from the great heat of the bed in its early state. 

Continue now to cover the glasses of the hot-bed every evening, 
about an hour before sun-setting, if mild weather, but earlier in pro- 
portion to its severity, with garden mats; and uncover them every 
morning, not sooner than between eight and nine o'clock, at this 
season; and observe, in covering up in the evening, that as the bed 
will at first have a strong heat and steam within the frame, it may 
be advisable to cover only a single mat thick for the first three or 
four nights, as a thicker covering in the early state of the bed might 
be apt to occasion a too violent internal heat and steam of a burn- 
ing nature; but as the great heat decreases, augment the covering, 
being careful not to suffer the ends of the mats to hang down con- 
siderably below the frame, over the sides of the bed, except in severe 
weather, which would draw up a hurtful strong steam from the 
dung, as well as confine the steam and heat too much, and keep the 
bed too stiflingly close from the external air, which would weaken 
the germination or sprouting of the seed, and the plants would come 
up weak and of a sickly yellowish hue: observe, therefore, these 



Jan.] the KITCHEN GARDEN. 15 

and the following precautions, in order both to prevent too great a 
heat in the bed, and that the plants may rise with a proper degree 
of strength and healthful growth. 

Likewise observe, on the above considerations, that in covering 
up, or applying the night covering of mats over the glasses, during 
the time the strong heat and steam continue in the bed, it would 
be proper when the mats are put on in the afternoon to raise the 
upper ends of the glass or glasses, a quarter of an inch or a little 
more or less, occasionally, both to give vent to the internal rank 
steam, and to admit a moderate degree of fresh airj and in which 
may fasten one of the covering mats to hang down a little over the 
part where the lights are occasionally opened to prevent the cutting 
external air from rushing immediately into the frame, especially 
after the plants are advancing; but this, necessary as it is, cannot 
be done with safety in very severe weather. 

Great care is requisite that the earth in the pots have not too 
much heat, for the bed is yet very hot, and therefore let the degree 
of internal heat in the bed be daily examined; and, if any thing of 
burning should appear, you can conveniently raise the pots farther 
from the dung, from which the danger proceeds, without disturbing 
the seeds or plants, and thereby prevent all injury from too much 
heat, provided you examine the bed every day, and give proper vent 
to the rank steam within the frame, while of a burning quality. 

In two, three, or four days after the seed is sown, you may expect 
the plants to appear; when it will be proper to admit fresh air to 
them, by raising the upper end of the glass a little every day: and 
if the earth in the pots appears dry, refresh it moderately with a 
little water that has stood in the bed all night, just to take oft' the 
cold chill; applying it about eleven or twelve o'clock of the day, 
and principally only to the earth, about the roots, not over the tops 
of the plants; which done, shut down the glasses close for about half 
an hour or an hour, then opened again a little, and shut close to- 
wards the evening; when continue to cover the glass every night 
with garden mats. And at this time also, if the heat of the bed is 
strong and the weather not very severe, raise the glass a little behind 
with a prop, when you cover up in the evening, to give vent to the 
steam; and nail a mat to hang down over the ends of the glass that 
is raised, to break off the sharp edge of the external cold night air 
from the plants; but when the heat is more moderate, the glasses 
may be shut close every night, observing to uncover in proper time 
every morning, to admit the essential benefit of day-light, sun, and 
air, to the plants; being careful to continue the aclmission of fresh 
air at all proper opportunities in the day-time, to promote strength 
in the plants, otherwise they would run weak, and very long and 
feeble-shanked; raising the glass as before observed, and if Avindy 
or very sharp air, to hang a mat before the place as above. 

On the day that the plants appear, sow a little more seed in the 
same bed, in the manner before mentioned; for these tender plants 
being liable to suffer by different causes at this season, it is proper, 
therefore, to sow a little seed at three or four different times in the 



IQ THE KITCHEN GARDEN. [Jan. 

same bed, at short intervals; for if one sowing should miscarry, 
another may succeed. 

When the plants, however, both of the first and succeeding sow- 
ings, are two, three, or fou-r days old they should be planted in 
small pots, which pots must be placed also in the hot -bed, in the 
manner following: 

Observe to fill the pots, the day before you intend to remove the 
plants, with some rich, dry earth, and set them within the frame till 
the next day, when the earth in the pots will be warm; then pro- 
ceed to planting, take the plants carefully up in the seed-pots, 
raising them with your finger, &c. with all the roots as entire as 
possible, and with as much of the earth as will readily adhere about 
the fibres; and thus, the pots of earth being ready, and forming the 
earth thereof a little concavely hollow a small depth, place the 
plants in the hollowed part of the earth slopingly, with their roots 
towards the centre, and earth over their roots and stems near an inch 
thick; observing to plant three plants in each pot; and if the earth 
is quite dry, give a very little water just to the roots of the plants 
only; and directly plunge the pots into the earth on the bed, close 
to one another, filling up all the spaces between with earth; and let 
every part of the bed within the frame be covered with as much 
earth as will prevent the rising of the rank, steam immediately from 
the dung, which would destroy the plants. 

Be careful to examine the bed every day, to see that the roots of 
the plants do not receive too much heat; if any thing like that ap- 
pears, draw up the pots a little, or as far as you see necessary for 
the preservation of the plants, re-plunging them again to their rims 
when the danger is over. 

Two or three days after planting, if the bed is in good condition, 
the plants will have taken root; though that is eftected sometimes 
in twenty-four hours. 

When the plants are fairly rooted, if the earth appears dry, give 
them a little water in the warmest time of the day; and if the sun 
shines it will prove more beneficial: let the watering be occasion- 
ally repeated very moderately, according as the earth in the pots 
becomes dry, and appears in want of a little moisture: and for this 
purpose always have some soft water set within the frame a few 
hours, to be ready to water the plants as you shall see occasion; 
but always with very great cautious moderation at this season. 

If there is now a brisk growing heat in the bed, you should, in 
order to preserve it as long as possible, apply some outward pro- 
tection of long stable-litter, straw, waste hay, dried fern, or leaves 
of trees, round the sides of the bed, raising it by degrees round the 
outsides of the frame. 

This will defend the beds from cold piercing wind, heavy or 
driving rains and snow, if either should happen; for these, if suf- 
fered to come at the bed, would chill it, and cause a sudden decay 
of the heat, whereby the plants would certainly receive a great 
check. 

If a lively heat be kept up, you may admit air to the plants every 
day, to strengthen their growth, by tilting the glasses in proportion

to the heat of the bed, and temperature of the external air: gene- 
rally observing, in this case, that when there happens a sharp cold 
air, or cutting wind, it would still be advisable to nail a garden-mat 
to the upper end of the glasses, to hang down over the place where 
the air is admitted, supported a little hollow or detached under- 
neath, two or three inches from the frame; and it will thus break, 
oflfand prevent the cutting external air from entering immediately 
into the frame upon the plants, and at the same time admit a proper 
degree of mild fresh air to greater advantage: however, in calm, 
moderate weather, this precaution is not materially necessary. 

About a fortnight, or a little more or less time after the bed ia 
made, you will carefully examine the heat thereof, to see if it wants 
augmentation; and when the heat begins to decline considerably,, 
remove the temporary protection of straw, hay, fern, or leaves from 
the front and back of the bed, if any was laid round it as before add- 
ed; then apply a lining of fresh hot horse-dung, close to one or both 
sides, as it shall seem necessary, by the heat being less or more 
decreased; for a constant regular degree of internal heat must be 
supported, to resist the external cold, and continue the plants in a 
proper state of advancing growth; but if the heat is not greatly 
declined, it would be advisable to line only one side first, applying 
it to the back of the bed; and in a week or fortnight after, line the 
front, &c., forming the lining about fifteen or eighteen inches wide; 
but raise it very little higher than the dung of the bed, lest it throw 
in too much heat immediately to the earth and roots of the plants; 
covering the top with earth two inches thick, to preserve the heat, 
and prevent the rank steam of the new dung from coming up, and 
entering into the frame, where it would prove destructive to the 
plants; the lining will soon greatly revive the declining heat of the 
bed, and continue it in good condition a fortnight longer. 

Ten or twelve days after lining one side, proceed as before, re- 
moving the protection of straw-litter, &c., if any, from the other 
side, and applying a lining of hot dung as above, afterwards to 
both ends; — ^and these will again revive and augment the heat for 
another fortnight, or more. 

After performing the lining, if very cold, wet, or snowy weather 
prevail, it may be proper to lay a quantity of dry long litter all 
around the general lining, which will protect the whole from driv- 
ing cold rains and snow, and preserve the heat of the bed in a fine 
growing temperature. 

By applying these linings of hot dung in due time, and renewing 
them as there shall be occasion, you may preserve the bed in a pro- 
per temperature of heat, of sufficieut duration to continue the plants 
in a free growing state in the same bed, until of due size for ridging 
out into the larger hot-beds, finally to remain to produce their fruit. 

Observe, however, that where there is plenty of hot dung, and 
every proper convenience, you may, in order to forward the plants 
as much as possible, prepare a second hot-bed, by way of nursery, 
about a fortnight after making the seed-bed, in order to receive the 
plants therefrom in their pots, when the heat begins to decline, 
plunging the pots in the earth, as above directed; continuing to sup-

port the heat of this bed, as already explained, and in which the 
plants may be nursed and forwarded, till they acquire a proper 
size for transplanting finally into the fruiting hot-beds. — See next 
month. 

When the plants have advanced in growth with their two first 
rough leaves, about two or three inches broad, and have pushed 
their two first running buds in the centre, or are a little advanced 
in the formation of one or two short runners, they are then of a 
proper size for ridging out into the large hot-beds, where they are 
finally to remain, which perform in proper time, according to the 
directions given in February, under the article Cucumbers, 

But in order to strengthen the plants in a more firm stocky 
growth, and to promote a production of fruitful runners, each plant 
must be stopt (as the gardeners term it), or topped at the first or 
second joint j i. e. the top of the first advancing runner, when form- 
ed in the centre like a small bud, should be pinched or cutoff close 
to the joint, as directed in February (which see), where the method 
of performing it is more fully explained. 

Care of the various sorts of Lettuces. 

If you have lettuce plants in frames, or under hoop-arches de- 
fended with mats, let them enjoy the open air at all opportunities, 
by taking the glasses, or other shelters, entirely off, when the 
weather is mild and dryj but if the plants are frozen, let them, 
while in that state, be carefully protected from the hot sun, which 
would materially injure them. 

In very wet weather, and when sharp cutting winds prevail, keep 
the glasses over them, observing however, to raise the lights or 
glasses behind, two or three inches, in mild days, to admit air to the 
plants: for, if they are kept too close, they will be drawn up weak, 
and attain to but little perfection; but let the glasses be close shut 
every night. In severe frosty weather keep them close night and 
day, and cover the glasses with mats, or straw, &c., both of nights, 
and occasionally in the day-time, if the frost is rigorous,: also let 
the same care be observed to those under hoop-arches; but let them 
have the full air in mild open weather. 

Or where any lettuces are planted in a south border, close under 
a wall or board fence, &c., it would be advisable, in hard frost, to 
cover them as above. 

In the above lettuces, in general, pick off all decayed leaves 
when any appear, keep them always cleared from weeds, and de- 
stroy slugs, which often greatly annoy them; and in mild weather 
stir the surface of the earth between, which will much enliven the 
plants. 

Sowing Lettuces. 

When lettuces have not been sown in autumn for early spring 
use, you may now sow any of the cos or cabbage kinds, on a slight 
hot-bed under glasses, to be planted out in spring; the young plants 
may be greatly forwarded, if pricked into another fresh hot-bed
