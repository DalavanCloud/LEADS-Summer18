PREFACE. 



Horticulture is one of those subjects which teem with endless variety. 
The raising of new Flowers, Fruits, and Vegetables — the importation of 
strange Exotics — the alterations in Practice, and the improvements in Culture, 
— furnish from time to time a continuous source of important and highly- 
interesting matter, well worthy of recording, and not less worthy of being 
studied. 

To collect, and concentrate in one Annual Volume, all matters of 
practical utility that have occurred during the year, has been the object of 
this Work ; and the success of the Volumes for 1846 and 1847 amply testifies 
that our labours have not been lightly appreciated — a compliment which we 
gratefully acknowledge. 

The subjects of every year are novel ; and, therefore, however much the 
several Volumes may assimilate in general character, the Contents of each are 
widely different, and replete with original and practical lessons ; — in fact, 
the " Annals of Horticulture " literally form a comprehensive History of 
Modern Gardening, and an Encyclopaedia of Horticultural Information for the 
time being. 

As heretofore, the Work will be continued in Monthly Parts, as the 
"Horticultural Magazine;" and at the close of the year will be bound up 
as the " Annals of Horticulture," in a Volume similar to the present.

THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



BY GEORGE GLENNY, F.H.S. 



This plant derives its chief attraction from 
the particular season in which it blooms. It 
is showy and varied, but it has neither ele- 
gance of habit, nor symmetry of form, nor 
fragrance to recommend it. The most remark- 
able of the flowers are notorious for their de- 
formity, and although we have now British 
seedling varieties coming something nearer to 
a proper standard, we are far from attaining 
what must be the character of the plant and 
flower before it can be ranked among the bet- 
ter class of Florists' flowers. 

Although a Chinese plant, our English 
varieties will soon outnumber and excel the 
original, and it will be, like the Camellia 
japonica, essentially English, or, at least, 
European, before many years pass over our 
heads. The plants are valuable as out-of- 
door ornaments in mild autumns, for they suc- 
ceed the dahlia ; and although a very severe 
frost will destroy foliage and flowers, they 
will live through a frost which will cut off the 
dahlia past recovery. They are, strictly speak- 
ing, half-hardy, but their beauty is frequently 
spoiled just as they are commencing their 
bloom. The plants, if grown in the ordinary 
way, are too tall to be handsome, and the 
lower leaves wither and turn brown before 
the blooms come to perfection, even when the 
season is suitable. This can only be coun- 
teracted by means of particular culture, and 
49. 



we can only accomplish an improvement in 
the habit by carefully counteracting the 
general tendency of the plant to grow lanky 
and talh In herbaceous borders, where the 
subjects are allowed to spread and throw up 
annually large bundles of stems, and where 
thegeneral collection of masses bloom yearafter 
year in large heads, the appearance of the 
Chrysanthemum is very showy ; and in such 
places they are undisturbed three or four years 
together ; but this can be hardly called culti- 
vation, — a hundred subjects that make very 
striking flowers under high culture, are but 
rough, though showy masses of bloom, when 
allowed to take their own choice. The carna- 
tion, pink, picotee, auricula, polyanthus, 
primrose, hyacinth, tulip, narcissus, and many 
other subjects which are noble under rich 
and judicious growth, spread and become 
large masses when left a few seasons, and, how- 
ever pretty in these wilderness-like borders, 
possess no claims to notice for their individual 
flowers, nor for the form of their plants ; yet, 
propagated yearly, or separated every season, 
or dug up and replanted properly and perio- 
dically, they preserve a character which is as 
superior as it is unlike the diminutive blos- 
soms that come in hundreds. The Chrys- 
anthemum, then, has to be looked upon in 
different stations ; first, as a perennial herba- 
ceous plant, in common borders, growing in 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



masses ; secondly, as a dwarf showy plant, 
sufficiently protected to preserve its foliage 
in choice clumps or flower borders ; thirdly, 
as a pot plant, to bloom under cover, and be 
removed wherever flowers are wanted. 

AS HERBACEOUS PLANTS. 

In all large concerns there are portions of 
the ground, especially distant from the dwell- 
ing, laid out as rough borders, in which her- 
baceous plants that require no culture are 
planted, to grow, spread, and bloom, year 
after year. Hollyhocks, Michaelmas daisies, 
Aaron's golden rod, perennial lupins, ever- 
lasting peas, early primroses, monk's-hood, 
digitalis, and a hundred other plants that die 
down and come up again, are planted and left 
without any other culture than forking the 
borders after they begin to grow, and giving 
an occasional dressing of some kind of manure. 
The Chrysanthemum ought to be among them, 
and form no small proportion of the whole. 
The yellow, primrose, white, red, brown, 
purple, and various other shades, may be 
planted in the spring. The ground ought not 
to be rich ; vigorous growth is very much 
against hardiness. The plant that will live 
through a frost in poor ground, will perish in 
the same temperature if the land be rich. 
This has been found by the growers of bro- 
coli. In hard winters acres have been cut. off 
in rich ground, while that in less exciting soil 
has escaped. If the border is anything like 
good ordinary loam, it is better merely to see 
that it is well drained, and plant without any 
dung or dressing. As the plants advance in 
height stakes should be placed to tie them up 
to, so that they may not be broken by high 
winds, and in due time, if frosr does not inter- 
vene, they will flower the first year, though 
not very strong. After the bloom is fairly 
off, and the beauty of the plant gone, they 
may be cut down to within four inches of the 
ground, and, if the weather be very severe, 
and litter can be had handy, a little thrown 
over the herbaceous border will protect many 
half-hardy subjects from damage. But there 
are many who do not think it worth the 
trouble, and therefore let all things take their 
chance. In the spring the plants shoot up 
much stronger, and require the same care as 
to tying to stakes ; but in these rough borders 
a single stake is generally all that is bestowed, 
thebranches being merely tied somewhatloosely 
together, something like a wheatsheaf, for 
the head of bloom covers all over the top, and 
looks best in a mass, besides being less damaged 
by hard weather. In this way, year after year, 
the plants will grow up and spread until they 
form huge bunches, with great masses of 
flowers ; and, when they become too large, 
*hey may be lessened by taking some of the 



roots away, all round, with the plants attached 
to them. This may be done by chopping off 
with the spade ; the pieces chopped off may 
be planted out elsewhere, or be used to make 
good any that are damaged or have died. 
The same management would apply also to all 
the other herbaceous plants of the kind, but 
our business is with the Chrysanthemum. 

AS DWARF PLANTS IN BORDERS. 

To make a naturally tall plant grow dwarf 
is not always an easy matter, but the facility 
with which the Chrysanthemum strikes en- 
ables us to take the tops off when they have 
made a considerable part of their growth, and 
thus produce the bloom -upon a stem half the 
length that it would have been. "We have 
always allowed the plants to grow as fast as 
they would, in a pit or greenhouse, or the open 
ground, but it is far better in the pit or 
greenhouse. In the months of June, July, 
and August, we have taken the tops of the 
strongest shoots, about three inches in length ; 
these should be cut up to a joint, and the lower 
leaves cut off, so as to leave half to three quar- 
ters of an inch of bare stem. Now prepare 
some wide-mouthed pots, by putting one-third 
of crocks, and fill up within three quarters of 
an inch of the edge of the pot, tapping the 
bottom on the potting-table to settle the soil 
moderately close, and make it quite level. 
The soil ought to be half loam, one-fourth 
turfy peat rubbed through a coarse sieve, and a 
fourth rotten cow-dung, also rubbed through 
the sieve. Fill up the pot with silver sand, 
which will be, of course, three quarters of an 
inch thick on the other soil, and with a very 
gentle watering saturate the sand and the soil. 
Then take a bell-glass, that will just fit a little 
within the edge of the pot, and, having first 
made a mark by pressing the edge into the 
sand, stick in the cuttings, ^o that the bottoms 
touch the soil through the sand, and not more 
than an inch apart. A gentle watering will 
settle the sand down close to the stems, and 
the glass should be then covered over, pressed 
into the sand a little to exclude the air, and 
the pot should be placed in a slight hot-bed, in 
a propagating-house, or in a cool part of the 
stove, and be shaded from the rays of the 
sun by a paper over the bell-glass. Whether 
there be one or twenty pots is immaterial — 
the same process must be gone through with 
each and all. Every morning the glasses 
should be wiped dry and bright ; cleanliness 
is everything with cuttings. The sand must 
be moistened whenever it gets nearly dry, and 
if any one of the cuttings exhibit anything 
like mildew or damping, remove it imme- 
diately from the pot, as there is nothing sooner 
caught than mildew or damp. In the course of 
a few days, comparatively, the cuttings will

begin to grow, and they are then in a fair way 
of striking. Continue your watchfulness, the 
drying of the glasses, the moistening of the 
sand, and removing any that appear inclined 
to damp off ; and when they have grown, and 
exhibit any appearance of having struck, pre- 
pare for potting them off. Use pots of the 
size of forty-eight to the cast, or large sixties. 
Put crocks at the bottom enough to ensure good 
drainage. Use nothing but loam from rotted 
turves if you can get it. You do not want to 
excite rapid growth ; on the contrary, the 
slower they grow the better, so that they keep 
growing in a healthy state ; put some of the 
loam, say half or two-thirds full, and then turn 
out the ball from the cutting-pot, or hold them 
sideways, and strike them gently sideways ; 
the sand will fall out, and the ball may be so 
loosened, that withdrawing the pot with a 
jerk will leave it on the bench. By pressing 
the ball it will part a little, so as to enable 
you to take the cuttings away one by one with 
earth about their fibres. Hold them upright 
in the pot, and place them so that the soil will 
come fully as high as the sand was. The 
earth should be pressed all round the root, 
moderately close, but not hard, and the pots 
knocked gently on their bottoms to settle the 
earth properly. After watering them, they 
should be placed in a frame, and the light 
covered down close the first day or two, and 
they must be properly shaded, or they will 
droop. Indeed they ought, if it were conve- 
nient, to be a little while in gentle heat, but 
this is rarely practicable, unless slight hot- 
beds were made on purpose. After the first 
day or two they must have plenty of air, and 
as soon as they have recovered the check they 
receive by transplanting, they may be removed 
to the open air on a hard bottom of pavement, 
or some contrivance which they cannot root 
into, for they will soon protrude their roots 
through the bottom of the pot, and strike them 
into a hard gravel walk if they are allowed to 
do so. They may have all the sun but an 
hour or two of the hottest in the middle of 
the day, but even this will not hurt them if 
they are kept well watered. The only danger 
is that, if they are neglected, the soil very 
soon bakes dry, and they then begin to suffer, 
and the leaves turn red or yellow. The best 
situation is a border which is protected from 
the midday sun, and made hard by paving, 
or having slates or wooden planks laid on ; in 
a very short time the pots will be filled with 
roots, and a change will be required, but the 
plants will be just ready to turn out in the 
clumps, borders, &c, whei*e they are to be 
flowered in their dwarf state. They may be 
planted out without dressing, three feet apart, 
to allow room for other subjects between them. 
They will flower at less than half the height 



they would have attained without cutting and 
striking, besides which they will not have lost 
their foliage nor their colour. The plants 
that are put out thus, would the next year be 
just as tall as any other ; and the only way to 
make them otherwise, is to take off the tops 
as we have described. 

IN POTS AS DWARF FLOWERING PLANTS. 

We have already described how the cuttings 
are to be taken and treated up to the filling of 
the first pots with roots. At the time when 
they are turned out as we have described for 
the beds and clumps, when dwarfing is an 
object, a certain portion may be continued in 
pots, but they will at that period require to be 
shifted into other pots a size larger. Nothing 
more need be done than striking the edge of 
the pot against the potting-table, while held 
the wrong way upwards ; the ball wall leave 
the pot whole. The crocks need not be dis- 
turbed, but a few being placed at the bottom 
of the new pot, and enough earth to just cover 
them, the ball may be placed in whole, as deep 
as may be, and the soil filled in all round, up 
as high as the edge of the new pot ; if the soil 
come higher up the plant than before, so much 
the better ; a gentle watering to settle the 
new earth round the ball will be necessary, 
and they may be then placed again in their 
out-of-door locality, attention being paid to 
their occasional moisture. They will all be 
more or less dwarf, according to the season, 
but in the general w r ay they require no other 
attention. We have already stated that the 
time to take these cuttings may be June, 
July, or August ; some, indeed, may be taken 
as late as September. It would be always 
found that the latest struck cuttings were the 
most dwarf when they bloomed, but it will be 
sometimes found difficult to strike the latest, 
and this is our chief reason for striking at 
different seasons. There will be no difficulty 
in procuring cuttings from the pots or out-of- 
door plants, but they answer better from 
potted plants, because they are always for- 
warder. They may again fill their pots with 
roots, and require a shift, but they ought to 
bloom in thirty-two sized pots, that is, pots of 
thirty-two to the cast, and technically called 
thirty-twos, and if they fill ever so much with 
roots, they must not be shifted into any larger, 
because you rather wish to check the growth 
than encourage it. In September the frost may 
come pretty sharply,and damage potted plants, so 
that about the middle of that month they should 
be placed in frames, and carefully closed and 
covered at night, on the least sign of severe 
weather ; but if this be not expected or likely, 
the glass is covering enough. The latest 
struck cuttings may be kept under glass all 
through, for as they may be potted off the

first time as late as the end of August, they 
cannot draw up much, but they ought to have 
all the air that can be given in mild weather, 
and only be closed in cold winds, and of even- 
ings towards the middle or end of September ; 
after this period they will show their bloom- 
buds, and when these once appear the plants 
do not grow materially. If fine flowers are 
the object, they must not be checked with 
cold, and many persons make up a house full 
of them, and regulate the temperature with 
great exactness. It will, however, always be 
found that the less artificial heat they have, 
the better will be the colour of the flowers 
and foliage, and the latter will be retained 
best on the stems ; which, in spite of the best 
management, will shrivel, turn yellow, or fall off 
altogether, when the plant is attempted to be 
forced, or, by the neglect of the watering, gets 
starved. It has been the custom of many 
nurserymen to take off cuttings as soon as 
they were strong enough ; but the great object 
of taking cuttings is lost under this treatment. 
The plants run up nearly as tall as if they 
were not taken off at all, but were left to grow 
their full height ; whereas, when their growth 
is half made, or even more than half, the tops 
have so much less to do, that they form really 
dwarf specimens when of the tallest kinds. 
Some, who appear to lose sight of the object 
in view, or, perhaps, never thought of it 
seriously, recommend cuttings to be taken in 
April, fancying, perhaps, they have made a 
great discovery, when they find that April 
cuttings strike more freely ; but they answer 
no purpose, because in April they are scarcely 
any length, while the June, July, and August 
cuttings are taken from the top of shoots two 
feet long. Now, we will not say that the top 
of a shoot two feet long, that would only grow 
to three feet if left on, would only grow the 
other foot, because fresh impulse gives vigorous 
growth ; but they will not grow one-half the 
length that April cuttings would, nor be half 
the trouble. The flowers as they advance and 
begin to open, become still more susceptible 
of damage by frost, and the prevention of this 
is the only care required at this late period of 
their cultivation. The nurserymen put them 
in houses, and give them a little heat, but the 
object is to bring them into flower earlier than 
they would come otherwise, and not with any 
hope of bringing them finer. Those in 
houses will commence flowering in October 
and November, and continue until some un- 
lucky frost gets to them, or they may be 
removed from time to time into the places 
their flowers may be wanted in. But the 
culture of Chrysanthemums may be considered 
complete, up to the period when the huds 
swell, and the flowers are opening ; the plants 
seldom grow much after that, unless they are 



in heat, and shaded, and this should always be 
avoided as much as possible, for the stems by 
elongating throw the leaves farther apart, 
and destroy the shrubby habit, which is, whe- 
ther natural or artificially produced, essential 
to the beauty of the plant. 

INCREASING THE BUSHY HABIT. 

Although we may obtain from cuttings 
much more free growth and larger flowers, 
and by taking them late keep the plants very 
dwarf without topping, they may also be 
dwarfed a good deal more by topping the 
strong shoots, and encouraging laterals. This 
is resorted to chiefly for large specimens, but 
the small potted plants that we have been 
treating of may be topped as soon as they are 
fairly established, and the side branches grow 
more numerous, and get forwarder than they 
would otherwise. The plant becomes more 
bushy, but the foliage and flowers come 
smaller. In short, we obtain more branches 
and bloom, but we sacrifice size to number, 
and sometimes it will be found necessary to 
top the laterals as well, for they would grow 
nearly as long as the original shoot would, 
and we have known plants so managed diffi- 
cult to bloom at all until very late in the 
winter. The way to manage these with the 
best chance of success, is to take one of the 
plants from the July cuttings, and as soon as 
it is planted out from the cutting-pot, and well 
established again, take off the top, leaving 
three inches, or if the plant be as short as that, 
merely pinch out the heart : as the laterals 
come out to the same length as theohdplantwas, 
they require to be stopped in the same manner, 
and in their turn will give out their laterals ; 
and where these cross one another, or are in 
the way of each other, or are too thick for 
their general appearance, they should be re- 
moved entirely ; but this may be continued 
so as to prevent flowering altogether, so that 
when the plant has become moderately bushy, 
all the shoots should be allowed to go up to 
bloom, and that without forcing, or heat of 
any kind, but merely protected from the 
weather by a frame and glass, and allowed all 
the air. 

DWARFING LARGE SPECIMENS WITHOUT 
STRIKING. 

We cannot prevent large plants from grow- 
ing to a considerable height, but we can at least 
check them a third of the elevation they 
would acquire in an ordinary way. The pots 
which have contained the plants of last year 
are at the close of the bloom placed in winter 
quarters, and the plants are cut down to 
within a little of the soil. In the spring, 
when these begin to grow, they should be 
turned out of these pots, trimmed, the top 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



surface of the soil taken away, pots a size 
larger should be procured, fresh drainage and 
fresh soil applied to the plants, the soil pressed 
well round the ball of earth, which if much 
bound should be loosened ; the whole should 
be well watered to close the earth about the 
roots, and the pots should then be replaced in 
the pit or frames they were in before ; these 
plants will in general throw up more shoots 
than are wanted, a selection of the strongest 
and best should be made after they have grown 
up a little, and all the lanky ones should be 
removed altogether. As they all advance 
they may be allowed to grow until the earliest 
cuttings are wanted, and the strongest shoots 
may be topped for that purpose. The length 
to which the shoots are shortened should be dif- 
ferent ; and in proportion to their strength the 
strongest should be left a good deal longer than 
the weakest, because they are capable of support- 
ing the greater number of lateral branches, 
but the tallest should not be more than six or 
eight inches high, and the weaker ones not 
more than half the height ; they may now be 
put out of doors, in the same way that young 
plants are, in the shade a little, and watering 
must be attended to. These plants will be 
considerably shorter, and more bushy in their 
habit, and bear a great many more flowers. 
But there is no way of producing the Chrys- 
anthemum so well, so elegant, in such good 
colour and condition as to foliage and flower, 
as that of taking the tops of the shoots at 
different seasons, and growing them without 
heat. 

CHRYSANTHEMUMS FOR SHOWING CUT 
BLOOMS. 

The system of culture for growing the best 
show blooms to cut, must be totally different 
from that which we have recommended for 
showing the whole plant. In the one case 
we want to exhibit a handsome bushy plant, 
with as many flowers as it will carry well and 
bring to an ordinary size ; in the other 
we care nothing about the plant, and only 
want an out-sized bloom to be cut off and 
shown in a stand. For this last purpose 
select a few of the best sorts, strike a portion 
in autumn, and another portion in early 
spring, in thumb-pots ; as soon as the roots 
reach the side change them to large sixties ; 
when the roots fill these change to forty-eights. 
All the while they are growing keep them out 
of doors in a sheltered situation and tied up to 
a stick but not too tight ; when their roots 
have filled the forty-eight sized pot, prepare 
the blooming-pots, size sixteen ; let there be 
a good two inches of crocks at the bottom and 
prepare a good rich compost, one-third good 
loam from rotted turfs, one-third turfy peat 
earth broken small, one- third well- rotted cow- 



dung, or dung from an old melon bed ; let 
this be well mixed and laid together a little 
while before using. When you shift, put 
upon the crocks that are for the drainage as 
much soil as will make the top of the ball of 
earth even with the top of the pot, and having 
taken the ball out whole with the plant un- 
damaged, fill up all round with the prepared 
soil, pressing it down between the ball and the 
pot. Take off all the side shoots all through the 
culture, from the time the cutting is first 
struck till the period of bloom. When the 
plants are shooting up pretty strong, take out 
the small stick to which they were tied, put 
regular carnation sticks and let them run up 
in the same way, be ready with the same kind 
of shade as the carnation. Besides having 
these in pots, plant some out of doors, but do 
not let the side shoots grow, and in other re- 
spects treat them as if they were in large 
blooming-pots. When the buds show them- 
selves, reduce them to the best two, and as 
soon as you can determine which is the most 
likely to answer your purpose, remove one of 
these, that all the strength may be thrown into 
one flower only : the plants in pots should be 
put into the greenhouse, or for want of that 
into a deep pit, or even into a dwelling-house, 
as soon as the weather becomes uncertain, 
because, as there is no succession of blooms, 
a frost would settle these altogether. Those 
in the ground may be bloomed upon tables 
like the dahlia, and covered with flower-pots 
in the night and during bad weather ; the 
bloom when once opening will not be improved 
by rain, nor by the sun when it is too power- 
ful, but covered over during the bad weather, 
and in the night, there may be a tolerably 
sharp frost without injuring the flower, and 
the plant stands a good deal of rough weather. 
Those who grow tulips under an awning will 
find the frame closely covered, protection 
enough for pots, and on taking the tulips up 
in June, the bed itself would carry the chrys- 
anthemums to a very good bloom, if they were 
planted out a foot apart, the dwarf ones out- 
side, the taller ones in the middle ; but only 
one shoot must be allowed to grow, and all the 
side shoots from that must be removed as fast 
as they grow. In the middle of September 
the side-cloths must be put up, and the top- 
cloth be put on, that they may be all made 
close in case of frost, and every night. They 
will have done their bloom in time for the 
tulips again, for as there is but one bloom, or 
two at the most, they will come earlier and 
be done with by the first or second week in 
November, which is time enough for the 
tulips. Those in the house will come the 
finest because they will have received no 
check. Those in the open ground will, how- 
ever, do well, and the lot flowered in the tulip

bed, will, if well arranged according to their 
heights, in five rows, a foot or a trifle less 
apart, form quite a handsome object during 
the greater part of October. If, however, 
they are not to be cut, but merely bloomed as 
a collection, three blooms may be left on each, 
to last so much the longer in flower. Chrys- 
anthemums are packed for showing the same 
as dahlias are, in tubes, with the stems through 
a stopper made of wood, cork, turnip, or 
potato, and so kept from bruising their under 
leaves by the height of the stopper, above the 
stand in which the tube is dropped, or some- 
times fixed. 

PROPERTIES OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM. 

"We expect a sort of remonstrance against 
the properties which we shall set down as 
desirable in the Chrysanthemum, because the 
forms of the present varieties are as numerous 
as were those of the dahlia when the published 
rules first st-t to rest the properties of that 
universal favourite. There were among them 
at that time anemone-flowei*ed, China-aster- 
flowered, globe-flowered, single, and semi- 
double, flat, starry, and ragged flowers, to say 
nothing of colours. In the Chrysanthemum, 
we are told in a very recent publication, that 
there are the ranunculus-flowered, the in- 
curved, the China-aster-flowered, the marigold - 
flow T ered, the clustered, and the tasselled, all 
of which, except the ranunculus-flowered, are 
untidy and flimsy. Great efforts have been 
made to bring these flowers into notice, and 
shows have been established at which the 
judges have not known by what rules to award 
the prizes, or which flower was the best. We 
affirm with great submission to those who 
pride themoelves on this flower, that it is im- 
possible to select one less fit to exhibit, cut 
from the plant, and that individually there is 
nothing to hope for in the bloom itself that 
should raise it to the dignity of a florist's 
flower; but as there is great merit in growing 
the plant well in pots only, and as the plant is 
showy when there is a scarcity of bloom in a 
house, they ought always to be shown in pots 
only, and the merits of the plant be taken 
into account quite as much as that of the 
bloom, and as such we shall notice both. 

1. The plant should be dwarf, shrubby, 
well covered with green foliage to the bottom, 
the leaves broad and bright, the flowers well 
displayed at tie end of each branch, come in 
abundant quantity, and be well supported by 
the stems. 

2. The flower should be round, double, high 
in the crown, perfect in the centre, without 
disk or confusion, and of the form of half 
a ball. 

3. Tiie individual petals should be thick, 
6mooth, broad, circular at the ends, according 



with the circle of the flower, the indentations 
where they meet hardly perceptible. 

4. The petals must not show their under- 
sides by quilling, and should be of such firm 
texture as will retain them all in their places. 

Size of bloom to be large in proportion to 
the foliage, but the size only to be considered 
when plants are in all other respects equal. 

The properties we have described bring a 
good flower under one of the two classes, 
ranunculus-flowered, or marigold-floAvered, 
and therefore we pronounce the tasselled, the 
quilled, the incurved, and all ragged and con- 
fused varieties, as well as all those which ex- 
hibit a disk, to be inferior to the other flowers 
in all the points in which their deficiencies 
can be recognised, and sincerely hope that 
there may in a few seasons be a sufficient 
number of good ones to enable us to banish 
them altogether as show flowers. 

A FEW OF THE BEST CHRYSANTHEMUMS. 

A society has at length been formed in the 
Metropolis for the encouragement of this 
autumnal visitor, and we have been gratified 
with a sight of Chrysanthemums as large as 
medium-sized dahlias. The capabilities of 
this flower are but little known by ordinary 
dealers ; for we have been to the advertised 
collections of Messrs. Chandler, said to be the 
best, and we are bound to say that we there 
saw nothing to tempt us to grow the Chrysan- 
themum, except as an out-of-door subject to 
prolong the lively appearance of the garden 
after the dahlias are over. The lanky branches, 
only half furnished with discoloured leaves, 
even in the best we saw, rendered them very 
ugly in pots, and those who do not see them 
grown as they may be grown, will not be 
tempted to adopt them as a stock flower in 
collections. Since the properties of the Chrys- 
anthemum were laid down a few years since, 
the foreigners appear to have chosen their new 
varieties better, and there are some approach- 
ing the standard. As a proof of the difference 
between well-grown and ill-grown specimens : 
we had made a descriptive list for the purpose 
of publication from the collection at the Vaux- 
hall Nursery, and after attending the show of 
the Chrysanthemum Society, held at the 
Rochester Castle, Stoke Newington, we threw 
our list into the fire ; we will give a specimen 
of the discrepancy. 

The Clustered Yellow. — "Bright 
yellow, flow r ering in clusters, with soft quilled 
i petals, standing out like irregular rays ; these 
! in some places thick ; in others thin, so that 
! the flower never forms a circle ; hard, con- 
, fused eye, with petals undeveloped ; abundant 
j bloom." 

Perhaps the above description, taken honestly 
[ from scores of plants at Vauxliall, is as unjust 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



as could be written ; but it seems that the Chrys- 
anthemum, like many other subjects, wants 
more care than nurserymen will bestow. 
Clustered yellow was in all the winning 
stands, and there were many pots of it besides, 
and our description from well-grown speci- 
mens would be thus : — 

Clustered Yellow. — A noble round 
bright yellow flower ; very full on the face 
with exceedingly good centre petals, inclined 
to cup, and altogether one of the best show- 
flowers, according to the properties laid 
down. 

Goliah, another grand flower, was ex- 
hibited, as large as a middling-sized dahlia. 
The petals of this flower curl upwards and 
turn over inwards, showing the back of the 
petal, but very uniformly closing into as 
splendid a bloom as ever we saw, forming 
almost a cone, but rounded. The colour is 
pale, but it is darkened gradually on one side, 
like an apple or other fruit ; the shading is so 
gradual though it deepens. The centre of 
this flower is good, though made up as it were 
by the curling petals meeting in the middle. 
We are quite within bounds in saying that 
Goliah was four inches across, and beautifully 
formed, the outline as true as a drawn circle. 

Two coloured incurved is a noble flower, 
the front of the petals one colour, the back 
another, and all the petals sufficiently incurved 
to show the backs. The face is rather hollow, 
but it is a bright-looking flower in a stand. 

One of the neatest and best formed of all is 
Annie Salter ; a small flower, bright yellow, 
with reflexed petals, laying well, and forming 
two-thirds of a ball. There is nothing among 
the whole tribe so completely a show-flower 
as this little pet, though it is very small com- 
pared with many favourites. 

Most of the Chrysanthemums in present 
cultivation, even the best, have curled, or, as 
they are called, incurved petals ; generally 
loose and irregular ; but there are a few and 
very few, that make up well, that is to say, 
that are symmetrical when full bloomed, and 
form a sort of half-globular flower, close 
enough to pass well in a stand. The publica- 
tion of the names of these will give our Con- 
tinental friends a good notion of what will pass 
current among florists; and we strongly advise 
all who intend to commence the cultivation 
of this flower, to confine themselves entirely 
to those we mention until they see something 
better, for the descriptions now publishing are 
altogether false, and we in vain, in a very 
large collection, sought for more ; we proceed, 
however, to describe them. 

Campestroni, purplish red, very full, toler- 
ably round ; a good full size, showing the 
dull underside of the petal by reason of its 
curling, the centre full of petals, but sunk. 



Beauty is after the fashion of Goliah, but 
not so compact. The flower forms well, be- 
cause, although the centre is thin, the petals 
curl over, and make up a nice globular and 
somewhat rich-looking flower. 

King is blush pink, curling like others, but 
making up into a showy, bold, round, good 
flower ; centre pretty round, and general 
appearance rich. 

Aristides is a fine orange-coloured medium- 
sized flower, very bold and full, desirable on 
account of its being the best of its colour, and 
showable. 

Defiance, large white, forms a good round 
flower by the petals curling inwards, so that 
the outside of them is shown ; the petals are 
not so thick as some, but the style is very 
pretty. 

Lucidum, a blush white; made up much in 
the same way by the petals curling inwards ; 
full-sized, and very pretty. 

Formosa is also a very pretty white, but 
not so large as some others ; forms a nice 
globular flower, although the petals are not so 
full as many of the sorts. 

These few are all that we should grow of 
the great number we have seen, and all we 
should recommend others to grow. There 
may be some new ones to come out in the 
season, and one especially that we at present 
do not know the name of, but which we mean 
to recommend to make up a dozen. It is of 
no use recommending a parcel of misshapen 
flowers that present no good qualities. It is 
wasting ground, and pots, and house-room to 
cultivate them. As, however, there are some 
who may wish to buy less than a dozen, the 
principal object will be to judge from the 
above descriptions which are the best, regard 
being had to diversified colours. The general 
management of the Chrysanthemum for the 
year round may be thus laid down : — 

January. — In this month most of the flowers 
will be gone, and the plants may be cut down to 
within three inches of the pot, and placed in the 
pits, where they can be covered up, or plunged 
in rows in the ground, to be hooped over, or 
covered with dry loose litter. Those which 
have not done flowering should have decaying 
blooms removed as fast as they decline. If 
the soil has wasted in the pots so that they 
are not full, fresh earth may be put to fill the 
pots, as the earth is some protection to the 
crowns of the roots, and it prevents water from 
lodging in the pots. 

February. — Continue as in January, 
taking out and providing for the bloomed 
plants, protecting against hard weather : the 
pits, or frames and lights should be left open, 
and the plants on all occasions uncovered in 
mild weather. 

March. — The balls may be turned out of 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



the pots, the top surface rubbed off, some of the 
spent mould shaken out of the roots, which may- 
be slightly trimmed, the plants repotted in the 
same size or larger pots, with fresh compost, 
new drainage, and so forth, and may be 
replaced where they were taken from ; only 
remember that when plants are plunged, the 
hole in which the pot is placed ought to be 
carried down lower than the bottom of the 
pot, narrow enough to prevent the pot from 
going down, but sufficient to hold the water 
which runs through the pot, instead of pre- 
venting its egress, which would be the case 
were the pot fitted to the solid bottom. 

April. — The shoots come up thick now, and 
those who propagate for sale take them off as 
fast as they come, and continue striking them 
under a bell glass in sand and soil, and with 
a little bottom heat ; rub the glass dry e,\ery 
morning inside ; shade the cuttings from the 
sun by means of paper which does not exclude 
the light. Those plants which are to be 
grown for specimens are not to lose any of 
their tops, but may have all superfluous shoots 
removed to strike for young plants. Continue 
protection through the month, and when 
necessary give them moderate waterings. 

Mat. — The plants may now generally be ex- 
amined and removed to a sheltered and shady 
place, where they are to make their summer 
growth. You may continue to remove super- 
fluous shoots and branches for propagation, and 
strike them as before directed* At the end of the 
month some of the struck cuttings may require 
potting off, and they should be continued in 
the heat they were struck in until the plants 
have recovered their check. You may begin 
now to trim the large specimens, leaving no 
more main shoots than you require. 

June. — Top some of the longest of the shoots, 
but not generally, as July and August cuttings 
make shorter and better plants ; but, where 
quantity is required, we cannot be too much 
upon the alert ; strike them as before. Pot 
off struck cuttings, and those which have be- 
come established and got over the potting may 
now be placed out where they are to grow ; 
some may be left to grow naturally, others 
may have the tops taken off to throw out late- 
rals. The large ones must be looked to and 
treated as required ; if they are to be grown 
as specimens, they must be shortened and 
trimmed out ; if destined to supply late cut- 
tings for dwarf plants, they may go on grow- 
ing. See to the watering, which must never 
be neglected with growing pot plants, because 
they dry rapidly. 

July. — Take off more cuttings from the tops 
of the strong shoots of the plants left for the 
purpose, and strike them as before. Pot off all 
those that are struck, and shift some of the 
earliest that have filled the pots with roots. 



Give also all the specimen plants a shift, if 
they have filled their pots with roots. Look 
well to the watering; top any of the small 
plants intended to be made bushy ; and place 
out those plants which have been potted off 
and have recovered themselves. 

August is a continuation of the same events, 
and, therefore, requires a continuation of the 
same treatment as tbat for July, Take off the 
last cuttings. Let them be from the tallest 
shoots, for they will, in the end, make the short- 
est plants. Strike them with great care and 
attention, because they are naturally the most 
obstinate. Pot off struck cuttings ; shift 
plants which have filled their pots from one 
size to another ; and look well to the specimen 
plants, which require thinning out, topping, 
removing, or shortening, the growing shoots 
to give something like symmetry to the plant, 
So with the young ones. If they are not 
growing handsome, and are getting lanky, 
shorten them also, always excepting those to- 
be grown naturally, but from cuttings ; tie up 
the specimens out of doors. Plant out some 
in the open ground. 

September. — Some of the plants are indi- 
cating flower, and all have, by the end of this 
month, come pretty well to their growth. Now 
they must be taken to their several places, ac- 
cording to their purpose, some into a warm 
greenhouse to bloom, and be drawn up, and 
spoiled ; some to the conservatory, to figure 
among the few autumn flowers ; but the mass 
to cold pits, where they are protected from 
frost, but can have all the air in mild weather, 
even by the entire removal of the glass all 
day. In all their stations they will require 
occasional watering ; fasten any of the loose 
shoots of these in the open ground. 

October and November is a mere con- 
tinuance of their approach to, or their com- 
pletion of bloom ; and they merely want the 
same treatment. Some apply liquid manure 
to them instead of plain water. It is a wrong 
notion, spoiling the texture, the colour, and the 
endurance of the bloom. 

December., — The bloom of the early ones 
begins rapidly to decline ; and, as this occurs, 
cut down the plants, and remove them into cold 
pits, or plunge them in the open ground where 
they can be protected by hoops and mats, or 
litter. See that the place be well drained, and 
have the pots filled with compost, that no water 
may lodge. Keep off the heaviest rains, if 
possible. Those in the open ground may be 
flowering half through this month, if the wea- 
ther has been mild ; but when the frost finishes 
the bloom, they may be cut down and cleared, 
and left to take their chance, or be covered up 
with rough litter. All the plants are to be 
removed from their various flowering places 
to their resting quarters, and be tended during

the rest of the winter as plants at rest ; very 
little water, very little care, an occasional 
inspection to see that the draining is clear, is 
all they want. 



MANAGEMENT OF GARDEN ALLOTMENTS. 

Those who will allot ground to poor cotta- 
gers at a moderate rate are real benefactors ; 
and those who are ignorant of the means by 
which ground is made profitable should be 
instructed by a supply of some plainly written 
book, that they may read, or have read to them, 
or, to make the work of benevolence more 
complete, they should be instructed. Economy 
in the management of an estate turned into 
allotments is a first consideration, and were we 
to attempt anything of the kind we should do 
it effectually. Let us first consider, then, 
what is necessary to a garden ? First, good 
ingress and egress by well-made paths and 
roads ; second, a supply of water within reach. 
We will suppose fifty acres of land to be 
adopted, from its situation, for the use of the 
cottage population of a village or town, and 
that the ground is worth 3/. per acre as a 
rental. To this fifty acres of land there 
should be a road or roads, so that there might 
be no difficulty of approach in bad weather. 
The number of allotments should be two 
hundred, which would allow of forty rods to 
each person, and the holding should be limited 
to the forty rods until a man could show the 
managers or the owner that his family was 
large enough to render him a proper object for 
more. The forms of these allotments should 
be, as near as may be, ten rods long and four 
wide, and as many of them squared properly 
as the form of the entire space will allow. Of 
course, some will be w r orse than others. We 
would have a range of pig-styes in the most 
convenient part, for the purpose of being let at a 
trifling rent to such allotment holders as choose 
to keep pigs, that they might have on the spot 
the means of using their waste profitably, and 
supply themselves with manure. There could 
be no difficulty in this arrangement, and many 
ways there are of carrying it out. On these 
fifty acres there should be placed a creditable 
man, whose cottage should overlook the whole 
plot, and who should have the following duties 
to perform : — He should keep the public roads 
in order, that is to say, the main roads that 
lead to all the allotments, but not the private 
paths ; he should be an inspector, to see that 
each allotment holder does not damage or 
infringe on his neighbour, or commit any nui- 
sance, or suffer weeds to seed in his ground 
and blow over other people's ; he should collect 
the rents weekly, and keep a record of all the 
occurrences of note ; he should keep a supply 



of appropriate seeds, purchased wholesale by 
the managers, and retailed at cost price to the 
holders ; and he should be in authority, as 
constable, to apprehend any trespasser or 
person committing wilful damage ; he should 
also keep spades, rakes, hoes, and other useful 
garden tools, bought wholesale and sold at the 
cost price to the allotment holders, or for a 
weekly payment instead of money down. We 
reckon this office at a cost of 20s. per week, 
or less, including his rent. So that let us 
charge the roads and repairs, and the pro- 
viding of proper wells or supplies of water 
at 1/. per acre, the overseer at 11. per 
acre, and the land 31. per acre. Let the 
charge for each allotment be 6d. per week, 
or twenty-six shillings per annum for each 
quarter of an acre, being at the rate of 
five pounds four per acre. The effect of 
allotments like these would be like magic on 
a rural population ; for it cannot be denied 
that in too many cases the prices have amounted 
to extortion. Five pounds per acre is enough, 
in all conscience, for a poor man to pay : but 
in scores of places there is more than double 
the rent charged ; in some places it has 
amounted to twelve pounds per acre. Here 
we have the means of providing two hundred 
poor men with each a garden large enough for 
his family purposes for sixpence a week; and it 
should be the study of the managers to draw 
up such rules as might prevent the holders 
from extravagance or waste by restricting 
them to the articles they should grow. These 
rules might extend to an obligation to grow so 
many rods of potatoes every year, and no more, 
because the first object should be the ensurance 
of food for the family, and preventing them 
from growing too much of a lazy crop. A 
few stringent regulations as to the disposal of 
so much of the land in useful food, and ju- 
dicious restriction of the quantity that might 
be used for flowers and useless or extravagant 
crops, would be as necessary to the well- 
being of the holder as the land itself. Sup- 
pose there were none, a man naturally idle 
might plant all his plot with potatoes, leave 
them to take their chance till earthing up 
time, and then leave them till the time for 
taking up, when, having more than he can 
possibly use, he would have to sell them, and 
the money might possibly be expended badly; 
whereas, if he were obliged to have different 
crops in about the proportion that families 
consume vegetables, he would be obliged to 
work at his garden continuously, and provide 
wholesome changes in the vegetable diet of his 
family, and sell the surplus if he please. We 
have especially mentioned potatoes, because we 
should not like to see our rural population 
become lazy. Ireland gives us too fatal a 
result for us to adopt potato culture as the 



10 



MANAGEMENT OF GARDEN ALLOTMENTS. 



dependence of our working classes. It has 
been, in our opinion, the ruin of the people 
there, as far as the total prevention of honest 
industry can be so called. If a family there 
could secure a piece of ground planted with 
potatoes, and take up the crop, it was all they 
cared for, the labour was nothing ; the crop 
was their food, and so without any incitement 
or encouragement to work, and enough potatoes 
to keep them from starving, they were alike 
reckless of every thing beyond the mere pos- 
session of their store to last the season. The 
failure of their crop, therefore, was the failure 
of every thing. To find them labour and pay 
them well for it was forcing them into active 
exertion, which they could not brook, and 
making them work or starve ; this un- 
fortunately put the whole population out of 
the way ; their discontent was manifest, — 
their idleness a downright firmly- rooted vice. 
They would understand nothing in the way of 
relief except finding them food, while they 
indulged, as heretofore, when their pits were 
full of potatoes ; and unless there were certain 
restrictions in the mode of cropping, the allot- 
ment of land among the rural population of 
England might in some degree awaken notions 
by no means beneficial to their morals or their 
social condition. There is as much to guard 
against in one extreme as the other. Give 
the poor gardens that shall enable them to use 
their over hours, and by means of increased 
industry procure a greater plenty of good 
wholesome vegetable food, and you teach them 
the value of labour by the double operation of 
profitably filling up their leisure time, and 
keeping them out of some other, and in all 
probability costly occupation. Nothing in our 
experience tends so to demoralize men as idle 
time on their hands : the mind must be 
amused ; the less mind a man has the more 
easily is he induced to go astray. What is the 
ordinary consequence of a man coming from his 
daily labour with three hours daylight on his 
hands before bed-time ? He and his com- 
panions, with no profitable object in view, — 
nothing to tempt them to advantageous occu- 
pation, go and take — we are putting the most 
favourable construction on the thing — go and 
take their social pipe and pint of beer at the 
ale-house ; suppose this to be done, and no 
more, the man has expended at the week's end 
one shilling for beverage in which his wife 
and children participated not, and goes home 
to bed to get up to his daily labour in the 
morning and repeat the same in the evening; so 
that instead of adding one iota to his resources 
by the three hours of his own time, he uses 
them to lessen his income, if nothing worse. 
But suppose — and this applies to a large por- 
tion of the rural population — suppose the 
mind is a little more active, and wants a little 



more excitement, — suppose there are games at 
skittles and bowls, and quoits, and other more 
objectionable gambling going forward, and he 
mixes with the throng, it is not one nor two 
pints that will do, and the Saturday night is a 
painful one to the mother and children at 
home ; suppose half the wages have gone to 
pay the ale-house score, and suppose the frugal 
shilling laid by for clothing by the frugal 
housewife is missing, and we gradually see the 
poor creatures worse clad and worse fed : 
what, then, becomes of the man ? He does 
not improve while he has three hours of idle 
time on his hands. He gets from bad to w T orse; 
he begins to see griping poverty at home. 
He has seen enough to feel acutely now and 
then the mischief he has done ; but, with no 
path pointed out for him, and no apparent 
means to recover himself, he flies to the ale- 
house to dissipate the gloomy picture, and 
makes bad worse; perhaps joins some society of 
poachers, and tries to get by these means some- 
thing to make up for the money spent in drink. 
One step only from poaching to less equivocal 
robbing, and the man is lost. How to reclaim 
the thousands of this precise character is 
worth serious consideration. Offer him an 
allotment, as in some places they do now, — he 
has no tools, no money for seed, no means of 
starting fair. Hence the necessity of adopting 
a system. Let the same power that provides 
him with a quarter of an acre of land at six- 
pence per week, provide him with his proper 
tools, seeds, and other necessaries, at sixpence 
a-week more till they are paid for, and the man 
is saved. He will fly to his garden, and feel 
it the greatest relief ; he will feel the good 
effects in an incredibly short time; he will lay 
down on his pillow fatigued, — but to lay down 
with a quiet mind after fatigue is one of those 
luxuries which are valued by all who can 
enjoy it; and who can so well enjoy it as those 
who have been previously in the habit of 
going home to a wretched wife, to ragged 
children, to an empty cupboard, feverish with 
drink, but nevertheless sensible enough to be 
cut to the heart by the sighs of his neglected 
helpmate ? Yet thousands of such men are 
allowed to go step by step to infamy and per- 
dition for want of considerate superiors. All 
men have to pay some sacrifice for the pre- 
servation of the bulk of their property. They 
pay for a watchful police ; they pay an in- 
surance premium to save themselves in case 
of fire ; and if the landed gentry in every 
town would devote the most favourably situated 
fields to give the humble population the benefit 
of a garden, they would be preserving in the 
most effectual manner the rest of their pro- 
perty. They would not be called upon for 
so much poor-rates; they would protect them- 
selves better than the police can protect them
