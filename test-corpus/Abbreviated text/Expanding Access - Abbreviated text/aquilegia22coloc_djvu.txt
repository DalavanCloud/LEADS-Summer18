1998 ANNUAL CoNPS MEETING 
September 18-20, 1998 Gunnison, Colorado 
Save these dates! YOU are invited! 


Are you looking for an unusual 
learning opportunity? Do you need an 
excuse to spend a weekend in peaceful 
and friendly Gimnison country? Has i t 
been awhile since you enjoyed the 
blazing gold of the fall aspens? Do 
you never have enough time to visit 
with your "botany" friends? If so, the 
Plateau Chapter encourages you to 
join us next fall for the Society's 
Annual Meeting! 

With the help of USFS Biologist 
Gay Austin and our local District 
Office, we were very lucky to be able 
to line up two of the West's top 
scientists to help us learn to better 
appreciate and understand sagebrush 
coimtry — a major ecosystem in 
Colorado and the West. Dr. E, Durant 
McArthur, from the USFS Shrub 
Sciences Laboratory in Provo, Utah 
will be our keynote speaker. Dr. 
McArthur has been doing research on 
Artemisia for more than 20 years and 
will help us as we learn to see 
sagebrush with "new eyeballs." In 
addition. Dr. Roger Rdsentreter, 
Plant Ecologist from the state BLM 
office in Idaho, will join us for both 
our annual meeting weekend and for a 
very special one-day workshop and 


field trip the preceding Friday (see 
announcement on page 4). In addition 
to being a noted lichenologist. Dr. 
Rosentreter is widely known for his 
work on microbiotic soil crusts. A 
fascinating mix of lichens, mosses, 
and algae, microbiotic soils are 
becoming known as critical to the 
health of many of the West's 
ecosystems. 

But that's not all! In addition to Dr. 
McArthur and Dr. Rosentreter, a 
talented and knowledgeable group of 
local experts will teach us about 
common wUdflowers of the sagebrush 
in the Gunnison Basin, habitat needs 
of the Gunnison Basin endemic 
sagegrouse, and native plants you can 
use in landscaping. Our own CoNPS 
Vice-President, Dr. David Buckner, 
will share information about how to 
restore disturbed sagebrush 
communities; and Colorado Natural 
Heritage Program Botanist Susan 
Spackman will enlighten us 
regarding those sagebrush ecosystem 
plants that are known to be 
threatened or endangered. Last, but 
not least, we will delve into the 
subjects of paleobotany and 
paleoecology with Dr. Steve Emslie 


from Western State College. Dr. 
Emslie is going to share his 
fascinating research regarding a 
group of people who lived in the 
Gunnison Basin almost 6,00P years 
ago. What plants could they have 
eaten or utilized? 

During the field trip on Sunday (10:30 
AM to 2:30 PM), we are tentatively 
planning to visit several different 
sagebrush community types, see a 
sagegrouse lek (mating ground), 
investigate microbiotic soil crusts, 
and — by very special arrangetnenf — 
be allowed to visit a newly- 
discovered and very important 
archeological site. All of these 
locations are close to Gunnison, but are 
on back roads that make carpooling 
impossible. Therefore, in order to 
protect our natural resources, we are 
asking everyone who wishes to join us 
for Sunday's field trip to sign up by 
August 20, 1998 for the bus that 
CoNPS will provide and for which 
we must ask a $5.00 fee. 

In addition to all of the above, you 
can expect to be able to enjoy our 
CoNPS book sale, posters, displays.
