ANNOTATED LIST OF THE FERNS AND

The aim of the present list of the Ferns and Flowering Plants 
of New York State, is to bring together as complete a list of these 
elements of our flora, both native and naturalized, including those 
which are reported as merely adventive, as the present state of our 
knowledge of them permits. The “ Wild Flowers of New York ” 
records, without definite localities in most instances, only those plants 
which might be classed under the rather elastic term “ wild flowers.” 
There is an apparent need, which this catalog attempts to supply, 
for a complete list of the plants of the State, giving in addition to 
the known list of plants of the State, brief citations of earlier 
notices of those which are regarded as rare or noteworthy or the 
range of which is limited or otherwise deserving of special comment. 
These notes are scattered through the botanical literature of the past 
century, and the annotation of them is urgently needed by the many 
students of our flora in all sections of the State. 

The earliest catalog of the plants of the State of New York was 
published in 1814, by Jacob Green, closely followed in 1819 by 
John Torrey’s catalog of the plants growing within 30 miles of 
-the city of New York. Torrey’s catalog of the plants of the State 
did not appear until 1840 and was the forerunner of his well known 
“ Flora of the State ” in two volumes published by the State in 
1843. This publication was followed by revised lists of the plants 
of the State in 1849 and 1866. 

During this period a few noteworthy local lists of plants were 
published in the annual reports of the Regents of the State of New 
York. Among these lists were those for Aurora, Cayuga county 
• by George W. Schenck (1840) ; Kinderhook, Columbia county, by 
W. V. S. Woodworth (1839) ; Homer, Cortland county, by George 
W. Bradford (1833) ; Amenia, Dutchess county, by A. Winchell 
(1851); Erasmus Hall, Kings county, by John Barrea Zabriskie

(1835) ! Lewis county, by Franklin B. Hough (1846) ; Bridgewater, 
Oneida county, by Asa Gray (1833) ; Onondaga, Onondaga county, 
by J. L. Hendrick (1837, 1^38) ; Seneca and Crooked lakes, by 
H. P. Sartwell (1845) and Ludlowville, Tompkins county, by Henry 
B. Lord (1866). 

Other very early but historically noteworthy lists of plants were: 
“ Plantae Plandomenses ” (Nassau county) by Casper Wister Eddy 
(1807); “ Catalogus Plantarum-Insula Noveboraco,” by John 
LeConte (1811) and “Plantae Coldenghamiae ” (Orange county) 
by Cadwallader Colden (1749-1751). 

The work started by John Torrey was carried forward by the 
late Dr Charles Horton Peck, State Botanist from 1869 to 1913, 
and while each annual report of the State Botanist contained addi¬ 
tions to the known flora of the State, no subsequent complete list of 
the plants of the entire State has been published, although John 
Paine jr, published in 1865 a “Catalogue of the Plants of Oneida 
County and Vicinity,” which was virtually a flora of the entire 
State north of the Hudson highlands. 

Since the publication in 1843 of Torrey’s Flora and in 1866 of 
Paine’s Catalogue, the knowledge regarding the vegetation of the 
State has been richly contributed to, not alone by the work of the 
State Botanist, but also by a constantly increasing number of other 
botanists and scientific bodies with the result that we have today 
numerous authentic and quite complete local floras and lists. In 
nearly all cases, however, these works are somewhat restricted in 
value by tbe absence of annotations covering the work previously 
accomplished. The best known of these local floras are the 
following: 

Beckwith, Macauley & Fuller. Plants of Monroe County and 
Vicinity, with Supplementary lists. 

Clute. Flora of the Upper Susquehanna. 

Day. Catalogue of the Plants of Buffalo and Vicinity. Catalogue 
of the Ferns and Flowering Plants in the Vicinity of Niagara 
Falls. 

Dudley. The Cayuga Flora. 

Burgess. The Chautauqua Flora. 

Fenno. Plants of the Susquehanna Valley and Adjacent Hills of 
Tioga County. 

Gordinier and Howe. Flora of Rensselaer County. 

Hollick and Britton. Flora of Richmond County. 

Hoysradt. Flora of Pine Plains, Dutchess County.

Paige. Catalogue of the Flowering Plants of Schenectady County. 
Peck. Plants of the Summit of Mount Marcy. Plants of North 
Elba (Essex County). 

Markle and Peck. Catalogue of the Plants of Albany County. 
Willis. Report of the Flora of Westchester County. 

Miller and Young. Catalogue of the Plants of Suffolk County. 
Wright and Hall. Catalogue of the Plants in the Vicinity of 
Troy. 

Goodrich. Flora of Onondaga. (The identification of many 
plants reported in this work is obviously incorrect.) 

House. Flora of the Eastern End of Oneida Lake. 

Taylor. Flora of the Vicinity of New York. 

The Vegetation of Montauk. 

Burnham and Latham. Flora of Southold and Gardiner’s Island. 

For a complete list of the published articles on the flora of New 
York the reader is referred to the “ Bibliography of the Botany of 
New York State,” in the New York State Museum Bulletin 188 
(1916). 

During the past few decades our knowledge of the flora of the 
State has increased greatly, both by special studies upon local floras 
and by critical investigations upon certain groups of plants such 
as the ferns, sedges, violets, orchids, thorns and brambles. Most 
of the publications upon these groups do not refer specifically to the 
flora of this State but cover the groups indicated without regard to 
geographical subdivisions, and like many other botanical papers in 
recent literature, are not to be cited in a bibliography relating exclu¬ 
sively to the State of New York. Consequently the following pages 
contain numerous references to botanical literature, which it is 
hoped will be of value and assistance to students of local floras. 
It is felt that there is no need to cite published records of the 
commoner species. In the case of the less frequent or rarer species, 
or those of peculiar distribution, or unsatisfactorily known distri¬ 
bution, the usefulness of the catalog is increased by citing not only 
the published records, but in many cases by also citing herbarium 
specimens. 

A catalog of this scope is not the place to discuss the ecological 
aspects of the vegetation of the State. The composition and 
definitions of plant societies and the complex relationships existing 
between plants and climate and soil factors is a subject which calls 
for special treatment and which bears only an indirect relation to 
a catalog of the plants comprising the vegetation of the State. This 
introduction, however, cannot be complete without a brief mention 


NEW YORK STATE MUSEUM 


of the importance of determining 1 the soil preferences of our native 
flora, and the determination of the effect of soil and length of 
growing season, and other ecological factors, upon the distribution 
and abundance of native species of plants. The opportunities for 
this important work, which has been too long neglected, are rapidly 
diminishing under the changes wrought by clearing, cultivation and 
other changes resulting from human occupation. 

Limestone rock formation and calcareous soils exert a most 
marked influence upon the distribution of plants, and so also do 
acidulous and siliceous soils, and the relation of these formations 
and soils to plant distribution should be more fully investigated.

B. lanceolatum var. angustisegmentum Pease & Moore, Rhodora 8: 229. 1906 
Meadows and moist woods. Infrequent and local. 

First recorded as B. lanceolatum by J. A. Paine (Cat. PI. Oneida 
Co. 179, 186. 1865). Subsequent collections and reports indicate 

that it ranges across the State northward, outside of the higher 
Adirondack^, southward to Rockland county. Typical B. lanceo- 
latum is now regarded as more boreal in distribution and as not 
occurring in the eastern United States.

In low thickets and open shaded soil. Frequent. Sometimes 
quite distinctive in appearance, but often showing intermediate forms 
or gradations with the typical B. obliquum. C. J. Chamberlain (Bot. 
Gaz. 70: 385-398. 1920) suggests that this is a sterile mutant of

B. obliquum, which seems quite likely, as mature spores capable of 
germination apparently are never developed. From the point of 
view of nomenclatorial rules it is unfortunate that this form was 
described 6 years before B. obliquum. That it should be taken up 
as the name of the typical species (Fernald, Rhodora 23: 151. 
1921, footnote) is most incongruous.

of its having been collected in this State since, although more than 
one collector has carefully examined the Little Falls region. The 
specimens by Peck from Lake Avalanche, prove to be W. alpina.
