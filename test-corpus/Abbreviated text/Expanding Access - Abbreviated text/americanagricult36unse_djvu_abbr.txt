We"W South "Wales. — ^We have received a 
email pamphlet on New South Wales, its progress and 
resources, published by authority of the Commissioners 
to the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. The 
pamphlet gives a description of the cotmtry, which is the 
eastern part of Australia, and of which Sydney is the 
chief town and port ; also of its industries, productions, 
climate, and resources. As the country has some fea- 
tures in common with our own great pastoral regions in 
the West, the methods there in use of disposing of and 
utilizing the immense tracts of public pasture lands, are 
interesting to us. One hundred and fifty millions of 
acres of natural pastures are leased at about one cent per 
acre yearly, and $200,000,000 are invested in flocks and 
herds. To divide up our western plains into 640 acre 
tracts, and ofi'er only 160 acres to a purchaser, is simply 
nrohibitory of their settlement, and throws vast tracts 
into the hands of squatters, without benefit to the public. 
Possibly the Australian method might suggest a plan 
ior the definite settlement of our vast pastoral regions.

AMERICAN AGRICULTURIST. 

NEW YORK, JANUAET, 1877. 

The new year opens favorably for the indnstries 
of the country. There is a prospect that all kinds 
of labor will be better remunerated in the future, 
than they have been for some time past. One of 
the most important changes for the better, is in 
our foreign trade. Instead of importing, as we 
have done for many years, a hundred millions of 
dollars worth of foreign goods more than could be 
paid for by our exports, the past year's business 
has been the other way, and we have sold of #ur 
home products considerably over a hundred mil- 
lions worth more than we have purchased. For- 
tunately we have a steady market for all our sur- 
plus farm products, and many of our manufac- 
tured goods, and a fair prospect of firmly holding 
these 'markets against all our competitors, while 
new markets and new articles of export are con- 
tinually being found. The trade in dressed beef, 
for instance, which has sprung up within a year 
past, has become established and promises to grow 
steadily ; this takes only what can be spared, with- 
out advancing prices here. An export trade in 
horses has also commenced, and several hundred 
have been shipped with profit. For fruit, vegeta- 
bles, giuin, dairy and other farm products, we have 
secui'e and growlug markets, and manufactured 
articles from mills, factories, and workshops, have 
not only supplanted imported goods in our own 
markets, but are actually competing 'with them in 
the countries to which we were formerly customers. 
With our wonderful resources, the United States 
promises to become the great gi-anary and factory 
of the world. If this promise is fulfilled, the great- 
est benefits will only be through the successful 
efforts of farmers and artizans to cheapen their 
products, while they at the same time maintain 
the excellent quality which has brought them into 
popularity. To the farmer the great problem to be 
solved is, how to lessen the cost of his produce, or 
increase its amount, and so increase both his gains 
and Ms comforts. To do this he must not only use 
industry, but all the aids which sdience offers him. 
True scientific farming is nothing more than the 
best possible practice. Nearly every farmer now 
understands this, and but very few are now inclined 
to think contemptuously of agricultural science. 
The attainment of this desirable end has been 



greatly helped by the efforts of the American Agri- 
culturist, in popularizing scientific knowledge, by 
showing that this is simply the knowledge of how 
to do things in the best, cheapest, most effective, 
and most profitable manner — in short, how to make 
the most money out of our labor. 



Bints a,1>ont 'Work. 

Seasonable Planting. — While it may seem strange- 
to the Northern farmer, whose fields are bound in 
ice or covered with snow, to speak of planting, it 
wiE be plain enough to his Southera co-worker, 
who works, or may do so, in his fields the year 
round. Bound potatoes planted this month in the- 
Southern States, will make a first crop in time for 
a second to be planted in July. The second crop 
that may now be in the ground, may be left for 
table use, or kept covered with litter or leaves, to 
keep out frost. The newly planted crop should 
be earthed up as they appear above ground, to pro- 
tect the tops from frosts. Oats sown at the Southi 
this month, wUl ripen ahnost as soon as fall sown 
oats, and -will be more likely to escape rust and 
drouth than if sown later. The oat crop may be 
made a very valuable one, and by good manage- 
ment win yield a large quantity of fodder. 

Compost Heaps. — Much may be done in making- 
compost heaps. In the_South there is a greater 
choice of materials than at the North, and anything 
that can be secured to add bulk to stable manure,, 
whether it be cotton-seed, bone-dust, guano, night- 
soil, or other readily fermentable matters, should 
be collected and saved. Where salt-marsh mud, or 
swamp muck can be procured, these make a good 
basis for a compost heap. 

Spreading Manure. — For some years we have 
spread manure during the winter upon meadows, 
clover-sod to be plowed for corn, and ground 
plowed for spring crops. The practice is economi- 
cal of labor, and convenient, and we have no rea- 
son to believe that the manure loses any valuable 
constituent. The ammonia of fresh manure is in a 
nascent or inactive condition, and is not wasted 
during the cold weather. Those who may find it 
convenient to use manure in this manner, can do 
no harm by making the experiment. Dairy farm- 
ers can not do better than spread manure upon 
their meado-n's and pastures as fast as it is made. 

lAve Stock. — Segular attention to all live stock is 
very important. If an animal is only half fed, it is 
better that it be half fed regularly, as it will suf- 
fer less injury than if attended to one day and neg- 
lected the next. But it is poor economy to stint 
food. "The liberal soul shall be made fat," To 
see one's stock contented, comfortable, and happy, 
is not only a happiness to a good farmer, but 
money in his pocket. Regular hours of feeding, 
regular watering, regular rations, and regular rest, 
are conducive to comfort. AVith regularity there 
is no haste, no -waste, nothing is forgotten, and 
nothing is done twice over. Animals then digest 
what they eat, and thrive. 

Ste-bles aiv3 Sheds should be kept dry and clean 
where frost is not severe, and where it is, the drop- 
pings should be removed daily, lest they be fro- 
zen into a mass and become difficult to handle. 
If dry sand or sawdust be scattered over a cleaned 
stall or shed, beneath the bedding, frozen manure 
can be taken up without trouble. It is preferable 
to have the stables so tight and warm that the ma- 
nure will not freeze in them during the night. An 
animal can not rest easily upon a bed of frozen 
dung, nor in a mass of filth. A cold stable may be 
much improved by lining it with rough boards, and 
filling the space between the two boardings -with 
rough litter, buckwheat-straw, or leaves. 

Feed Sacks. — Have a plenty of feed-racks in the 
yards. They save fodder, and prevent the master 
animals from driving weaker ones from their feed. 

Cam-Fodder or Pea-Straw should be passed 
through a feed cutter before feeding it to stock in 
pens or yards where manure is made. The litter is 
then short, and the manure easily moved and 
spread, sa-ving both time and labor. 

SaU should be given regularly to every anim&l

escept poultry. Pigs should have only a very small 
quantity ; one ounce weekly, to each fuU-grown 
one, is sufficient. Horses, oxen, and cows may 
have one ounce daily, and sheep may be supplied 
with aU they will consume. 

Sheep. — A nin in a stubble field when the ground 
is bare, or the snow is only three or four inches 
deep, will be of advantage to the sheep. Any 
weakly ones should be turned out by themselves, 
in a place where they can be looked after. A con- 
stant watch should be kept over the flock, lest one 
should fall into a furrow or drain and be unable to 
recover itself. Ewes may thns be lost if neglected. 
Never fail to count the sheep when they go out and 
come in. Never compel them to jump over bars, 
but remove the lowest one, lest legs be broken. If 
a sheep's leg is accidentally broken, bandage it 
with splints, and keep it by itself for a week or 
two, until the fracture is repaired, which is easily 
done, without any dressing or other treatment. 

FouUnj.—M early eggs are desired, the pullets 
and young hens should be fed in the mornings 
with some cracked corn steeped in boUing water 
until it is only moderately warm. In the afternoons 
some corn warmed in the oven may be given. Be- 
tween these meals some mixed feed of potato peel- 
ings, house scraps, and wheat screenings boiled to- 
gether, and seasoned with red pepper, will be use- 
ful. A cabbage may be hung in the yard for them 
to peck at. Provide a clean, warm, but well ven- 
tilated house, and nests of clean straw. 

Sundry Matters.— 'Se careful of lights in the barns 
and stables. Safe lanterns only should be used. 
We have used the glass globe lanterns, protected 
with wire, for many years without the least acci- 
dent, or breaking one of them. Only perfectly 
safe oil should be used. Devoe's and Pratt's oils 
may be used with perfect safety anywhere. With 
these oils if a lamp should fall, there can be no fire 
If it is picked up again immediately. Choose a 
perfectly solvent Insurance Company in which to 
be insured, and take no risks. Keep roofs, roads, 
and sidewalks clear of snow. Ventilate the cellars 
whenever the weather is sufficiently mild. A tub 
of water placed in the cellar on very cold nights, 
will protect fruit or vegetables from freezing. 
Clean up all machines and tools and oil them, coat 
the bright parts with tallow, and cover them to 
keep out dust and dirt. Prepare for packing ice 
by and by, or pack it now if possible. A few loads 
of saw-dust should be hauled when convenient, so 
that it will be ready when wanted ; when the 
wagon-box is filled, pile on filled bags to complete 
the load. Keep the shoes of horses and oxen 
sharpened or roughened, and do not attempt to 
drive un-shod oxen ; it is poor economy to save a 
set of shoes and lose half of their working power. 



Notes on Orchard and G^arden Work. 



From the questions addressed to us, in cases 
where we know that an answer would have been 
found in these columns, we infer that these notes 
are not read by all for whom they are intended. As 
formerly headed, " Work in the Horticultural De- 
partments," it is likely that many have hastily 
pa,ssed them by as being " Horticultural," and hav- 
ing no interest for them. On this account we 
adopt another heading, which is not open to this 
objection. At the beginning of the year it may be 
well, for the sake of our many new readers, as well 
as the older ones, to say a word about the scope 
and object of these " Notes." Horticulture is, of 
course, only a branch of Agriculture, and it is 
often difficult to draw a line between the two. The 
notes on farm work include all the farm crops, the 
farm buildings, and domestic animals. We expect 
that every fanner will have an orchard and kitchen 
garden ; we would have every one own a fniit gar- 
don ; we hope that every farmer takes sufficient 
pride in the surroimdings of his bouse to be inter- 
ested in the notes of the "Flower Garden and 
Lawn " ; and moreover, that he or some of his 
family will keep a few plants through the winter, 
whether it be only a pot or two in a window, or a 
larger number in a conservatory or a small green- 



house. All these are rm-al matters, they concern 
all who own and cultivate land, and are regarded 
as belonging to horticulture. While some of the 
topics are, or should be, of interest to all farmers, 
all of them are so to some farmers. The point we 
wish to impress is this : the notes xinder these 
heads are intended/of the same persons as are those 
on general farm work, which precede them. Of 
course all are not equally interested in such matters; 
the large grain grower, the dairyman, or cattle 
raiser, cares for fruits and vegetables only so far as 
his family supplies go, though if his sons or daugh- 
ters wish to cultivate choice fruits and flowers, he is 
quite willing, and will often encourage them in it. 
The majority of farmers have small farms, they 
hold high priced land, and they must raise high- 
priced crops. The tendency of farmers in the older 
States, or anywhere near cities or manufacturing 
towns, is to convert theu' small farms into large 
gardens, and raise fniits and vegetables to supply 
the near market. Our letters show that as large a 
number of inquiries are on matters, to which the 
cultivators of large farms scarcely give a thought, 
as they are concerning farm crops proper. These 
notes are not in any manner intended for profes- 
sional gardeners or nui'serymen, but solely for 
farmers, or others who have a garden — small or 
large — and need such seasonable hints as are sug- 
gested by letters of inquiry, or by our own experi- 
ence.. While they must of necessity treat of simi- 
lar subjects year after year, they are always fresh, 
and often embodj" new things, that might form 
topics for distinct articles ; moreover, the answers 
to various letters are frequently included — though 
without so stating — in these notes. No one en- 
gaged in any branch of agi-iculture, can afford to 
do without a book devoted to his pursuits. There 
were never many sneers about book-gardening ; 
even those who ridicule book-farming — a class that, 
we are happy to say, is rapidly diminishing — seem 
to admit that a book on gardening may be useful ; 
" wise in their own conceit ' ' upon farming matters, 
they are quite willing to accept aid in matters 
about which they know nothing. A book — if it is 
one fit to be regarded as a standard — puts the pres- 
ent state of oiu- knowledge upon its subject in a 
compact form, for easy reference, and no matter 
how full we may make the paper, it can never su- 
persede the use of books. It is the business of 
papers to record improvements and progress, and 
they can not consequently repeat first principles. 
Hence we say that, in every and all branches of soil 
cultivation, whether sheep-raising or strawberry 
growing, a book on the subject wull pay for itself 
many times over — provided it is studied and its 
teachings heeded. As this is the season for book 
and brain work, we give under each head the names 
of the most useful works in each department. 



Orcbard and Nursery. 

An orchard is defined as " An enclosure devoted 
to fruit trees," and a nursery as "A place for 
propagating plants — particularly a place for propa- 
gating trees or shrubs for transplantation." — As in 
the poDular idea a nursery is almost exclusively re- 
garded as a place where trees and shrubs are sold, 
no doubt that many, seeing the heading " Orchard 
and Nursery," have supposed that the notes refer- 
red to commercial nurseries, and passed them by 
as of no use to them. We do not presume to teach 
those who are in the nurserj- business, but our 
notes refer to such propagation of trees and shrubs, 
as may be practised by farmers and others. So 
with the orchard : oue whoso chief business is fruit- 
raising, does not look to his agricultural or horti- 
cultural paper for his guide, but in addition to his 
own experience, he has as aids all the standard 
works on fruit, looking to the journals for descrip- 
tions of new varieties and new methods, and the 
experience of others in the s.ime occupation. But 
a dozen trees are as properly an orchard, as are a 
hundred acres in trees, and the owner of the small- 
er number is much more likely to need aid, than 
the regular orchardist. Hence our notes are main- 
ly, though not entirely, intended for the fanner, 
or the one whose orchard is of moderate extent. 

No fruit.— h.5 stnuige as it may seem, there arc 



many farms, and large ones too, on which there is 
no orchard. The settler in a wooded country is 
sure that trees will not grow on new-ly-cleared land • 
and the one who has opened his farm on the prai- 
rie, can notplanthis fruit trees, until he has set a 
wind-break— and there is always something to pre- 
vent that. The years go by, and no trees are plant- 
ed, and the family go without fruit as a necessary 
part of then' daily food, and only know it as a 
luxury seldom to be indulged in, on account of the 
expense. "It should need no argument to induce 
evei7 farmer to have an orchard, large or small, 
and assuming that those who have no orchard will 
plant one, that those whose orchard is superanuat- 
ed wUl set a new one, and those who have already 
a smaU orchard wUl supplement it with another, 
we give a few hints as to 

Orchard Planting. — No one should plant an or- 
chard, unless he can give the land entirely up to 
the trees, when they come into bearing. In the 
older States we hear much about the orchards 
"running out," the trees cease to be productive, 
and we are told that the "climate has changed," 
or that varieties have " degenerated." In all such 
cases it win be found that it is the land that has 
"run out," "changed," or "degenerated," and 
this because the land has been made to beai- two 
crops, oue of fruit, and one of something else ; it 
has been " skinned " so beyond endurance, that it 
yields no fruit, and very poor weeds. Trees plants 
ed at ordinary distances, meet at their tops, and 
the same t hin g takes place with their roots, which 
so occupy the soil that there is not only no room 
for anything else, bnt they will themselves in time 
so exhaust the soil that it must be enriched. 

Neiolij planted Orchards should be cultivated, and 
to secm-e this, crops may occupy the spaces be- 
tween the trees, allowing each full possession of 
as much soil as its size demands, growing only 
such crops as require manure, and will leave the 
land in as good condition as when the trees were 
first set. As the trees increase in size, more space 
must be given up to them, and the strips in cuHi- 
vatioB narrowed. When bearing begins, cropping 
should cease. Turning an orchard into a grain- 
field or a meadow, is a sure way to ruin the soil ; 
turning it into a horse or cattle pasture will as 
surely ruin the trees. The best treatment of an 
orchard is to keep it in clover, and pasture pigs np- 
on it ; this is excellent for both the pigs and the 
orchard. The occasional plowing required to allow 
the clover to be renewed, will turn under a most 
excellent fertilizer, and the land will be kept im- 
proviug. An incidental advantage to both orchard 
imd pigs will be that the fallen fruit will be eatCB, 
and the increase of insects checked. As to the 

Sbleotion of Yabieties. — Do not set too many 
kinds, no matter how highly they are praised by the 
catalogues or the books. Twelve varieties are a 
sufficient number for any fruit, whether for home 
use or market. If of apples, two of these may be 
of the very early, four for autumn, and six of win- 
ter sorts. What these varieties should be, is a 
matter of the greatest importance. It is impossible 
to give a list that wUl suit all over the country. The 
best guide is local experience, and oue about to 
plant, should take time and pains to learn what 
varieties have done well in his locality. In a per- 
fectly now country, it will be safest to plant those 
known to succeed over the widest range. 

Where to Buy. — We are frequently asked this 
question, and our advice is— other things being 
equal — to deal with the nearest uurseryman. We 
have often given our opinion of tree-peddlers, and 
again advise caution. Some good nui-serics send 
out agents or canvassers, and when satisfied that 
one of these is duly authorized by a responsible 
nursery to solicit orders, it may be safe to deal with 
him — but be sure of this first. At any r.ite it Is 
best to send to one orraore nurseries for catalogues, 
to compare prices. If several can combine and 
order together from a nursery, it will save freight 

Wlutt to Buy. — Send orders before spring opens, 
that the trees may not get heated or dried onton 
the road. Should the trees get frozen in transit, 
put the package in a cool cellar, or cover it outside 
with a heap of liay or straw, to thaw gradually. 



AMERICAN AGRICULTURIST. 



[Januabt, 



What to 5«!/.— Planters make a mistake in prefer- 
ring large trees. Overgrown nursery trees are 
usually not worth the cost of freight. KeooUect 
that the larger the trees, the more the roots will be 
injured m taking them up. Many experienced 
planters prefer to set one-year-old trees, and claim 
that they come into bearing nearly as soon as those 
3 or 4 years old, while having control of them from 
the beginning, they can shape them to suit. 

Buying Ifursery Stock.— Those who are not in a 
hurry can purchase root-grafts of apples, and 
pears, and peaches " in the bud," 1. e., the stocks 
were budded last year, have "taken," and will 
grow the coming season. Root grafts have the cion 
inserted on the root of a seedling at the "collar," 



and are offered by many nurserymen. 



In these 



forms trees can be bought very cheaply, and as 
they take but little room, the freight on them is 
low. If set in nursery rows, but a small percent- 
age will fail. The rows should be wide enough 
apart to work between them with a cultivator, and 
the plants one to two feet in the rows, according to 
the time they are to remain. In this way one can 
get trees very cheaply, and by purchasing a large 
surplus, sell to his neighbors young trees, in a year 
or two, for more than enough to pay for his own. 

Varietws.—ln order to aid in a selection, we give 
a list of those varieties of apples, pears, peaches, 
plums, chen-ies, and quinces, that succeed over a 
wide extent of country, hut this is not intended to 
supersede local experience. The varieties of other 
fruits are given under " Fruit Garden." 

Apples.— EsiTly.— 'Red Astrachan, Early Harvest, 
Tetofsky, Golden Sweet, Williams' Favorite.... 
Autumn.— Duchess of Oldenburg, Gravenstein, Jer- 
sey Sweet, Porter, Jeflferis, Keswick Codlin, Maid- 
en's Blush, Chenango Strawberry Winter.— Am. 

Golden Russet, Ben Davis, Bethlehemite, Fameuse, 
Johuathan, Lady, Mother, Red Canada, Wine Sap, 
Bentley's Sweet, Lady's Sweet, R. I. Greening. 

Pears.— EstTlj Summer. —Manning's Elizabeth, 
Doyenne d'Ete, Dearborn's Seedling — Late Sum- 
mer.— Bartlett, Beurre Giffard, Clapp's Favorite.. . . 
Autumn.— Belle Lucrative, Beurre d'Anjou, Beurre 
Hardy,Doyenne Boussock, Duchesse d'Angouleme, 

Howell, Seekel, Urbaniste Winter.— Dana's 

Hovey, Lawrence, Vicar of Wmkfield. For market 
the largest number of trees should he Bartlett. 

JfeacAes.— Beatrice, Early York, Early Crawford, 
Old Mixon Free, George the 4th, Ward's Late 
Free, and Smock, would give early and late. 

Plums. — Unless one will work to keep rid of the 
curculio, it is of little use to plant the finer kinds. 
The improved wild sorts give good cooking frait ; 
the true Wild-goose is regarded as the best of these. 
Cherries. — Where the curculio abounds, cherries 
do poorly. The Early Richmond is generally suc- 
cessful, and excellent as a cooking fruit. Coe's 
Transparent, Black Tartarian, Belle de Choisy, and 
Louis PhiUipe, are amongst the most reliable. 

Quinces. — The Apple, Angers, and Rae'e Seedling 
are all useful and profitable. 

Care of Young Ordiards. — Keep out all stray ani- 
mals by strong fences and closed gates.... Tramp 
the snow hard around the trees, to prevent the 

mice from working Sprinkle blood on the trunks 

to keep off rabbits. Trap or shoot rabbits. Where 
there are but a few trees, tliey may be protected 
from mice and rabbits by putting heavy roofing pa- 
per, or a shield of laths or corn-stalks, or old roof- 
ing tin, around the base of the trunks. 

Insects. — Much can be done to prevent the ravages 
of tent caterpillars, by cutting off the clusters of 
eggs, which may now be seen glued in a band near 
the ends of the twigs. 

Cions. — Cut them during mild weather, label, and 
store in sawdust or sand in a cool cellar. 

Labels. — Renew all that are defaced, but do not 
depend upon them ; they are convenient, but a 
permanent record or plan should always be made. 

Bnoles on Orchard and Nursery. — As a work com- 
prising aU that most farmers would care to know 
about the propagation and management of fruit 
trees, with descriptions of select lists of fruits, we 
especially commend Barry's " Fruit Garden." Au- 



o-ther excellent work of a similar scope, is Thomas' 
"American Fruit Cultuiist." As a work of refer- 
ence, containing descriptions of nearly all known 
varieties, Downing's "Fruits and Fruit Trees of 
America," is unrivalled. Warder's "Am. Pomolo- 
gy " is on apples ; Qulnn's " Pear Culture," and 
Fulton's "Peach Culture," are indispensable to 
those who engage in these fruits as specialties. 
In the Southern States this should be an active 
month in the orchard ; experienced fruit growers 
regard this as favorable a time to plant trees as 
later. Old orchards are to be invigorated by a shal- 
low plowing, and where fertilizers, such as com- 
post, or lime, or ashes are needed, apply them now. 



Xlie Fruit Garden. 

The common method of growing the small fruits 
in the kitchen garden, is better than not growing 
them at all, but there are so many reasons why the 
small fruits should be by themselves, that any one 
who can possibly do so, should set apart a piece of 
land for the small fruits. Our remarks on these 
fruits, given under the head of Fruit Garden, ap- 
ply to the varieties wherever grown. 

Why Ham a Fruit Garden ? — Primarily as a source 
of home eajoyment and health, and secondarily as 
a source of profit. Most of us can recollect when 
a strawberry patch was a rarity, and cultivated 
raspberries and blackberries almost unknown, and 
when even prosperous farmers depended upon the 
pastures and thickets for the few berries they en- 
joyed. While the cultivation of small fruits has 
increased most wonderfully, they are by no means 
gro^vn by all who might have them, if they would. 
The most indifferent as to their cultivation, are re- 
markably appreciative of the fruits themselves. As 
a matter of profit, they save other food, they save 
health, and they make the young people more con- 
tented. Besides these, there is scarcely a locality 
in which a surplus of good fruit wlU not only sell, 
but sell well. The boys and girls can readily earn 
enough to supply them with books, and their pa- 
rents with the Ajnerican Agriculturist and other pa- 
pers besides, and thus pay in a double sense. 

Books. — Barry's, Thomas', and Downing's works, 
referred to under " Orchard and Nurseiy," also in- 
clude the small fruits, and there are works especial- 
ly devoted to them. Fuller's " Small Fruit Cultur- 
ist," and Roe's " Manual of Small Fruit Culture," 
are general works. Fuller's "Grape Cnltifrist," 
and his "Strawberry Culturist," and others, in the 
Publishers' book list, are special treatises. 

Cra7iber>->es do not properly faU under the Orchard 
or the Fruit Garden, they being a special crop, and 
profitable only in peculiar localities. White's 
" Cranberry Culturist," gives the fullest directions, 
and anticipates every inquiry. 

Soil and Manure.— The fruit garden should have 
a rich and well-drained soil, and the spot should be 
selected within easy reach of the house, so that an 
eye can be kept upon trespassers, and the picking 
be readily done by members of the family. Well 
decomposed manure only should be used, and 
abundant materials provided for mulch. In some 
of the Southern States the soil may be made ready, 
and much planting may be done this month, but in 
colder localities this is not pratieable until winter 
is over. It is especially desirable that the sou be 
of such a character, and drained if need be, that it 
may be worked very early, as early planting is es- 
pecially necessary with some fruits. At present we 
enumerate 'the leading varieties, to aid in making a 
selection preparatory to planting. 

Barberries are seldom cultivated for their fruit, 
except by persons from New England, where they 
often line the roadsides, and are both ornamental 
and productive of handsome very acid fruit, which 
makes excellent preserves. There are several 
species and varieties of barberry, but none superior 
as a fruit to the common Barberry. It makes a very 
neat hedge, and may be used to separate the fruit 
garden from the kitchen or other garden. Readily 
multiplied by cuttings. 

Blackberries need abundant room ; 6 feet apart 
each way at least, and 8 feet is better. The best is 
Kittatinny. Wilson's Eariy is early, productive. 



but not quite so good. Dorchester, one of the 
best, but not productive. The New Rochelle is 
large, showy, but very sour unless dead ripe, and 
is less hardy. The plants are propagated from root- 
cuttings, and win bear the next year after planting. 

Currants. — There are many varieties in the cata- 
logues, though the desirable ones are few. None are 
superior in flavor to the old Red and White Dutch; 
if these have rich soU, and are well pruned, the 
fruit will be larger fmd finer than it usually is. The 
Versailles, Red, and White Grape, are larger and 
best for general culture. Black currants are not 
popular in this country, though some value them 
for jam and jelly ; the Black Naples is best. 
Easily grown from cuttings. 

Dwarf Trees. — The only large fruits in place in 
the fruit garden, are those which have been grafted 
upon some dwarfing stock. Except the pear these 
trees have little practical value. The pear is dwarf- 
ed by budding it upon a quince stock. When so 
treated, it bears at an early age, and usually pro- 
duces a good crop, for the size of the tree, of large 
and exceedingly fine fruit. Some varieties do not 
succeed on the quince, while with others the fruit 
is greatly improved. There are but few cases in 
which we would advise planting dwarf pears tor . 
profit, but if one wishes to test many varieties in a 
small space, the dwarfs allow him to do so, and 
they are always beautiful and interesting objects. 
Among those that do so much better on quince 
that they are often planted for profit, are the 
Duchesse d'Angouleme, Beurre d'Anjou, Louise 

Bonne de Jersey, and Howell Dwarf apples, 

grafted on " Paradise " stocks, are charming orna- 
ments ; they may be trained as pyramids or bushes, 
and when well filled with large fruit, are a great 
curiosity to those unfamiliar with such things. 
Some of the so-caUed dwarfs are grafted on " Dou- 
cin " stocks, and grow too large for the fruit garden. 

Grapes are among the easiest grown and most 
esteemed a nong the small fruits ; they would be 
more cultivated than they are, were it not for the 
popular notion that great skill is required to prune 
them. By intelligently following a few simple rules, 
which we give at the proper time, any intelligent 
person can do all that the vine requires. The grape- 
vine is one of the most tractable of plants ;• it may 
be made to fruit within a foot of the ground, at the 
top of a fence, or along the second story of a house ; 
the sides of bams and outbuildings may be covered 
with the foliage and clusters, they may be grown 
on the simjjlest trellis, or even on a rude pole. 
Most of the popular varieties may be grown from 
cuttings set in the open ground ; the plants at the 
nursenes are very cheap, and there is no reason 
why every farmer's family, or every family that 
o\vns an acre of land, or even a village lot, should 
not have all the grapes they can eat. We say to 
every one who owns land, be it much or little, plant 
one vine, if you can do no more, plant ten if you 
can, and as many more as you have room for, so 
that you and your children can daily have your fill 
during the grape season. 

Varieties of Grapes. — ^Afl the Bartlett is the most 
popular and useful among pears, so is the Concord 
among grapes. There are few localities in which it 
will not succeed. It is not of the best quality, but 
whoever has a vine is very sure to have grapes. So 
we say, if but one kind is to be planted, let it be 
the Concord. The Wilder, (Rogers' No. 4), and 
Barry, (Rogers' No. 43), have, with us, all the good 
qualities of the Concord, and larger and better 
frait. The earliest grapes, with us, are the Crevel- 
ing and Eumelan ; not making regular hunches, are 
unsoited for market. Hartford Prolific, not so 
good as these, is early, hardy, and abundant. These 
are black grapes ; the very best hardy black gi'ape, 
we know of, is the Alvey, a poor bunch and poor 
bearer, but we value it beyond all others. Among 
red grapes, Catawba and lona, where they succeed, 
are among the best. Delaware is very sweet, and 
generally liked, and Lindley and Agawam, (Rogers' 
9 and 1.5), are the best of Rogers' of this color. 
White grapes are more sought after than any others, 
but we have few good ones. The hardiest is Mar- 
tha, sickishly sweet and unpleasantly foxy ; Croton 
succeeds in some localities ; Lady and Elvira are of

AMERIC AM AQRIC ULTURIST. 



promise, but are yet to be generaJly tested, Theie 
are new varieties not yet offered, superior to any 
yet in cultivation, but have yet to be tested. 

Oooseberries.—Thesa are propagated and treated 
In the same manuer as currants. While this Is one 
of the most popular fmits in Europe, the kinds so 
successful there are well nigh worthless in our hot 
summers, and we have had to rely on our native 
seedlings. The grafting as standards, upon the 
Missouri currant, promises to allow us to enjoy 
the choicest English kinds ; a full account o£ these 
was given in September last. Of the natives the 
Downing is best ; the Mountain, Houghton, and 
Smith's seedlings are all very productive. 

Baspberries. — The choicest varieties are tender, 
and unless they can be laid down and covered with 
earth for the winter, they should not be planted. 
Brinckle's Orange, Red Antwerp, and Franconia, 
belong to this class. The Philadelphia is a poor 
berry, but gives a large crop, and is quite hardy. 
The Brandywine, Highland Hardy, and Herstine are 
among the best hardy sorts. Blackcaps are liked 
by many ; of these the Doolittle, and Mammoth 
Cluster are among the best. The Black-caps are 
propagated by layering the tips of the shoots ; the 
others multiply by suckers. 

Strawberries are so easily managed, and so per- 
sistently propagate themselves, there is no reason 
why every farmer's family should not have the fruit 
three times a day, during their season, besides a 
surplus to sell at the nearest village. Any one 
who can cultivate potatoes can grow strawberries, 
as there is no plant, the management of which is 
more simple, as we shall show at the proper time. 
We now attend to the selection of varieties, having 
reference to home use and a near market. The 
Wilson is the popular market berry, but it is not 
desirable forfamily use ; Chas. Downing is superior 
to it in every respect, save femness, which adapts 
it to shipping. We regard the Charles Downing as 
the most generally useful berry for home cultiva- 
tion. Nicanor, Seth Boyden, and Kentucky are 
other well tested sorts. Monarch of the West, and 
Star of the West, promise well. In certain local- 
ities, with rich, strong soils. President Wilder, 
Triomphe de Gaud, Jucunda, and others are valu- 
able, and each year new varieties are offered, which 
those who can afford tbe money and time may 
test. The plants should be from last year's run- 
ners, and not old clumps split up ; set as soon as 
the frost is out, and if well cultivated during the 
season, they wiU give a full crop next year. 

Ill Vie SoKthern States planting of all kinds may 
be done, gi-ape vines pruned and trained, and every- 
thing put in order for an early start. 

Kitclien Crarden. 

As we have hinted with regard to fruit culture, a 
farmer may often sell from his Kitchen Garden 
enough to pay all its expenses, and it is very easy, 
where there is a demand for fresh vegetables, to 
extend the kitchen garden into a market garden, 
the management of the two being nearly the same. 
Indeed, as before hinted, in all localities near mar- 
kets, fanners find their profit, if not in market 
gardening proper, in what we may call farm gar- 
dening. In market gardening, a large portion of 
the products are of a perishable nature, like lettuce, 
radishes, etc., and must be marketed at onoe, while 
farm gardening is devoted to crops in larger de- 
mand, and which are more permanent, such as 
cauliflowers, celery, onions, and the root-crops. 
Some, near New York, get a larger net profit fcom 
a single acre of spinach, than othcrs»do from a 
farm of 30 acres. In localities where there are 
large express, rail-road, or other stables, carrots are 
in demand, and we have known a farmer to make 
from .5IT.5 to ?300 per acre on these roots. It is 
only in thickly settled communities, or with easy 
access to a good market, that these returns are 
possible, but it is well for every farmer Ihus locat- 
ed, to find out if there is not some such crop that 
he may grow with [iroflt. 

Books. — Henderson's "Gardening for Profit," 
Quinn'8 " Money in the Garden," and Brill's " Farm 



Gardening and Seed Raising," may all be studied with 
benefit, each contains something the others do not. 

Varieties. — Next month we shall, as usual, enumer- 
ate the most profitable varieties and the novelties. 

Piants in CoM Frames must be aii'ed whenever the 
outside temperature will allow. 

Freparatory and other work. — Keep the manure 

pile increasing Overhaul and repair botched 

sashes or make new ones.... Make a supply of 

straw mats for early spring use See that the 

leaves or litter are not blown away from spinach or 

other covered crops Roots and celery in trenches 

will need more covering as the cold increases 

Repair implements and make mai'kers and all other 

conveniences likely to be needed Overhaul the 

seeds on hand, and throw away all doubtful ones. 

At the South. — ^Put in early potatoes, on light 

soils ; on heavy soUs ne3rt, month is better Sow 

at onee hardy vegetables, s "ch as peas, radishes, 
lettuce, spinach, etc., and at intervals for succession 
The root crops, beets, carrots, parsnips and sal- 
sify, ai-e sown in the last^ half of the month 

Prepare hot-beds and sow early cabbages. 

Flo-wer Cnai-den and I^a^fii. 

Our notes on other matters are so fuU that this 
department must wait until another month for de- 
tails. The principal thing to be done is to prevent 
injury to the trees and shi-ubs. Some thoughtless 
people, when snow affords sleighing, will drive any 
where across the grounds, often to the injury of 
choice shrubs. Have the drive way, if need be, 
defined by stakes and stretch a fence-wire to keep 

off such persons Evergreens are often loaded 

with . snow, which should be shaken off before it 
becomes hard and icy ; if the lower branches are 
covered in a deep snow, this should be shoveled 
away, to prevent breaking the limbs as the snow 
settles after it has frozen to them. 

In the Southern States. — Prune roses and flowering 

shrubs generally Camellias out of doors, and 

about to bloom, should he surrounded by a frame, 
over which a cloth can be thrown in unusually cold 
weather, to protect the buds. 



<j}i"eeMlioiisc and W^iii«lo'»v Plants. 

The treatment of plants in mndows is not essen- 
tially different from that for those in greenhouses, 
but in the latter case the conditions being more 
under control, the matter is much easier.... Bring 
bulbs and other plants that have been potted for 
forcing into the greenhouse, or dwelling room ; 
starting a few at a time for a succession of bloom 

Water only as the plants need it ; more plants 

are killed by keeping the soil soaked and soggy, 

than by theother extreme Give air on mild days, 

but avoid cold drafts On very cold nights re- 
move house-plants back from the window, and 
cover with a sheet or newspapers ...Cover the 
plants when the room is swept, occasionally wash 
smooth leaves with warm water applied by a 
sponge ; shower the plants with rough or downy 

leaves Insects are not difficult to keep down if 

taken as soon as they appear. Smoke in the green- 
house, and tobacco water for window plants, kills 
lice or "green fiy. " Frequent showering and 
washing removes the red spider ; mealy bugs can 
be picked off with a pointed stick, and scale re- 
moved by the use of a brush and warm soap suds. 

Sow seed of Sweet Alyssimi, Mignonette, and 

other annuals for blooming later. 



Crops in <"»corg"ia. — Circular No. 33 is- 
sued by tbe State Dopartmciit (if AgricuUmc of Georgia, 
by tbe Coraniisi^ioncr, Boot. Janes, pivcs a consolidated 
rt'port of crops of 187G, with the general averages of yield. 
Corn is given as yielding 22 per cent more tliaii tbe crop 
of 1875, and tbe breadth planted as 10 per cent greater ; 
a total increase of 31 per cent over last year. The cost 
per bushel is .13 cents against r>8 cents last year. Cotton 
lias yielded 3 ]mm' cent less than last year, and its cost of 
production is about one cent anda quarter per pound loss 
than tliat of 1S75. Tbis reduction is due to tbe inereased 
home production of jirovisions and supplies, a result 
wbieb is to be credited, jierbaps entirely, but cei-l:iiiily in 
great part, to the valuable and siiroes^^fal labors of tlie

markets. The decline in gold, and extreme flrmnesB in 
ocean freigMe, have also worked against activity in pro- 
dace, on export account Breadstuffs opened with more 

ainmation at advanced prices, with a good demand for 
Biiipment, especially for Flour, Wheat, Corn, and Eye,— 
Cam, in good part for Italian ports, and Rye mainly for 
Germany. Toward the close, however, the inquiry from 
all sources fell off materially, and values yielded slightly 
in the instances of Flour, while Spring Wheat, and most 
kinds of Barley ruled lower. Red and Amber Winter 
Wheat was quite firm at the improvement, the latest

month, including prime Amber Missouri, 56,000 bushels, 
in store, to a local miller, at $1.40 ; and fancy Amber In- 
diana, 24,000 bushels, in store, for shipment and milling, 
at $1.50. Corn ruled comparatively firm, on a fair de- 
mand. Eye closed up strong and wanted,— prime State 
selling at 95c. ; good to prime Western at 82@85c. Bar- 
ley declined materially, under heavier supplies and more 
urgency to sell, while the demand was moderate. No. 1 
Canada closed at $l.iaj®S1.15 ; ordinary two-rowed 
State sold at 68@70c. ; and sundry car lots of Feed stock 
at 46@50c. About 43,000 bushels California Barley, of 
late arrival here, have been taken for Cincinnati or Chi- 
cago, on private terms. In the Flour line, very liberal 
transactions were reported early in the month, largely in 
JUinnesota Extras, at buoyant rates ; but the final deal- 
ings were quite limited Provisions have been freely 

dealt in, especially hog products, but at very irregular 
prices Cotton has been quite active, but at lower fig- 
ures. Toward the close, more extensive purchases were 

reported for shipment, chiefly to Liverpool Wool has 

been in less demand, and somewhat less buoyant as to 
values. The inquiry from manufacturers has been com- 
paratively very moderate Hops have been in less re- 
quest, and at the close quoted easier — Seeds have been 
in fair demand, closing firmly Hay and Straw moder- 
ately sought after at steady rates Tob.icco has been 

fairly active, and essentially unaltered as to prices

Beeves.— The market for the past four weeks has 
been marked chiefly bj^ dullness. An advance of f c, ^ 
Jb in the first week was soon lost, mainly by the unfa- 
Torable pressure of thin and poor Texans, and receipts 
of western dressed beef. Nothing was able lo resist the 
downward tendency. The demand for fine fat oeeves 
for foreign shipment, of which about 1,600 head were 
shipped last week, did not help things, and these extra 
beeves sold for llic. per 60 ft to the cwt. Sixty head of 
fat Christmas cattle were sent alive from Philadelphia. 
Texans have sold for 2i@3}c, "j! Ib live weight, with bull's 
at 2i@3c. The market, as we close our report, is dull, 
prices ranging from 7@7Jc. \9 t> for poor cattle : 8i®9Jc. 
for pretty good, and 10@10ic, tor good to choice. A few 
extra steers of 57 Sis. to the cwt., brought lie, ^ ft. 
While the average was helped by some good stock, the 
general decline during the last week was fully J-c, ^ lb.

CoH's.— For poor cows there is very poor sale. A 
few of ihis character have sold for $35, while 25 fairly 
good cows averaged $60. An extra premium cow sold 
for $125. Many springers are arriving that pass at once 

into the hands of country dealers CalveSo- Dressed 

Teals are plentiful, and live are too numerous for the 
limited demand. Pat dressed veals sell for 10@11c. ^ ft,

after a dull time through the month, prices are down 
from ic, to Jc. %9 ft. Lambs are now sold with sheep, 



varying from 5 to 6^c. ^ ft. Prime sheep in lots, witb

Lower term? are given to clubs of four or more sub- 
scribers, partly because it costs less to mail in packages, 
with only name slips on each paper,; and partly to en- 
courage getting up large lists. We do not object to a 
person's adding names to his club from other post-offices, 
because such additions usually become centers of other 
clubs A Club can at any time be increased by the ad- 
dition of other names, if these start with the same date 

as the others Any one having sent a small club at one 

price, may raise the club to a large figure, and lower rate 
for all. Thus: one having sent 4 names at S5.40, may 
send 6 names more for $7.60, mailing §13 for the whole 
10, including postage. And so for other clulj rates. . 
The Terras are; Underfour names $1.60 each ; four to 
nine names $1.35 each ; ten to nineteen names, $1.30 
each ; twenty names and upwards, $1.10 each. Postage 



always pre-paid by the Publishers Premium cluba 

may be gathered at any number of post-offices, if all are 
sent in by the same person. 

It "W^iU a»ay to supply yourself, your sons, 
and your workmen, with good papers and books. $10 to 
$20, or more, expended in this way, will come back every 
year. Tour sons will be kept from idleness and mis- 
cliievoiis company; they will understand and respect 
their work more ; they will gain new ideas and learn to 
think and reason better; they will learn to make their 
heads help their hands ; they will labor more intelligently 
and be happier because their minds will be developed, 
and they will have something to think about while at 
work. Better sell an acre of land than not to have these 
mind cultivators. Any intelligent man will make more 
off I'rom 9 acres than the unintelligent One will from 10 
acres. Think of this in planning and providing for your 
sons in the future. Store their growing minds with use- 
f-ul ideas, or the devil will fill the vacancies with very un- 
desirable tenants (ideas). (The premium list on page 33 
will afford to many an opportuni-ty to get some books free 
of expense ; and plenty of good books, to be delivered by 
mail or otherwise, wiU be found in the advertising pages.) 

Every Ccemian Cnltivatoi- and 
I^afoorer on tlie Farm, or in tlie Garden, 

OUGraT to have tlic German edition of the American 
Agnculiitrist. It contains not only the Engravings, and 
all the essential reading matter of the American edition, 
but an additional Special Gerjuan DepartiTient, edited by 
the Hon. Frederick Miinch, of Missouri, a skillful and 
successful cultivator and excellent writer. No other 
German Agricultural or Horticultural Journal in America 
has been so long issued ; no other one contains so much 
useful information, or a tithe of its engravings. The 
Germans are a reading, thinking people, and know how 
to make good use of what they read. Many Americans 
supply it to their German laborers and gardeners, and all 
would find it pay to do so. — Nothing else can compete 
witb it in cheapness of price for the same amount of 
material, engravings, etc., because the expense of collect- 
ing and making these is largely borne by the American 
edition, and no separate office or machinery is required 
beyond a couple of German editors and the printers. 
Its terms are the same as the American edition, singly 
and in chibs; and clubs can be composed of subscribers 
for eitlier edition in whole, or in part. — ^^ Please call 
the attention of your German neighbors to this paper. 
I[ will do much to help new comers to a knowledge of 
the system and modes of culture used in this country. 

Stnily tSae Afl.lveH'tasing' Colnnins. — 
We often take up a daily or weekly newspaper and care- 
fully read all the Advertisements through, and never do 
this without getting some useful information. One 
learns what lousiness is being done, and how it is done — 
what is for sale, and by whom. Our business columns 
are of especial value, because of the care taken to ex- 
clude all advertisements from parties not believed to be 
honest. We mean to advertise for no parties who have 
not both the ability and intention to do all they prom- 
ise. In order to please advertisers, we repeat the request 
that those sending orders, or for circulars, etc., to our 
patrons, will mention where the advertisements were 
seen. We also like to have advertisers thus get some 
idea of the large number of intelligent and, enterprising 
people they find among our readers. 

A Oood "Woi-lc, it will be, to suggest to 
a neighbor to supply himself and family with the thous- 
and or more columns of g#od reading, practical hirts and 
suggestions, useful information, and the 600 to '.OU pleas- 
ing and instructive iiew engravings that will l)e given in 
the American AgncuUurist during this year. It will do 
him and his family useful service. Do him and us the fa- 
vor of suggesting his subscription for the present volume. 



Xlie I>e.itU o< CUarles B>. ISragdon. 

—The agricultural press has lost one of its best writers, 
and one of the most industrious workers, in the death of 
Mr. Bragdon, which occurred at his father's residence at 
Port Ontario, N. Y., on the last day of November. His 
disease was consumption, and his health had been such for 
some two or three years that lie sought relief in a warmer 
climate, l)ut without avail. Mr. B., when quite young, 
was a favorite with the late Br. Kennicott, whose teach- 
ings did much to prepare liim for his future career. He 
was at one time engaged ui>on the "Pjiairie Farmer,'* 
then upon the '■ Rural New Yorker " at Rochester; he 
went to Chicago, again, as agricultural editor of the 
"Chicago Tribune," and while on that paper filled other 
positions. When the "Rural New Yorker " was remov- 
ed toN. Y. City, he became its principal editor, and con- 
tinued in that position until he could no longer discharge 
its duties. He was a versatile writer and an indefatigable 
worker ; he for many years reported the meetings of the 
American Pomological Society, and the volumes of its -
