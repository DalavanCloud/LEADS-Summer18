AMPHIPACIFICA is an international jour- 
nal of aquatic systematic bio logy aimed primarily 
at publication of monograpliEC studies that are 
overiy large (25-50^ printed pages) for traditional 
taxonomic Journals. The journal has featured 
studies on crustaceans of the faunistically rich and 
palaeobiologically ancient North American Pa* 
ciffc coastal marine regiorn However, the geo- 
graphic scope extends to other marine regions, and 
to adjacent fresh watersK Faunisticallyt it encom- 
passes other free living and parasitic invertebrate 
taxa, and aspects of aquatic vertebrate animals that 
may involve systematics, ecology and behaviour. 

AMPHIPACIFICA is scheduled to appear 
approximately quarterly, with a run of 250-300 
copies per issue* each of about 125 pages, and a 
total volEime pagination of approximately 500. 
The printed page size is 8.5 X II inches (22 X 27.5 
cm). Paper quality accomiriodates line cuts and 
halftones at300-6(KI d.p.i., and a limited number 
of colour plates at author cost, Manuscripts are to 
be submitted in “camera-ready"' computerized for- 
mat (IBM- or M AC-compatible diskettes), and 
also in hard copy, that have previously been ref- 
ereed (name to be supplied) and text-edited at the 
author's instigation. Suitability of manuscripts, 
based on content and adherence to submission 
regulations, will be decided by the Advisory Board 
of the journal. 

The cost of printing and mailing of each issue 
is defrayed by institutional and Individual sub- 
scri ptions to the Journal of S5() (CAN) or $40 (US)

Introduction 

During the course of study of hyalid amphipods of 
the North American Fadfic coast. Bousficid & 
Hendry cks (2002) encaunlercd a number of characters 
and character states on the basis of which generic 
subdivision of Hyaie Raihket scns. iat. ) seemed ad vis - 
ab] e. Some of these had not hi the rto bs?en treated i n the 
generic type species Hyaie pom lea Rathke, 1837. As 
material of the type .species w as not avalEable to them, 
E, L, Bousfield contacted the first author of the present 
paper who had recendy published comprehensively on 
the Medi ternmean hyaiid fauna and was able to re- 
examine extensive collections of H. paniica and simi- 
lar species 1 n the m useum at Y erona, Ital y , and els w here , 
7 hese species were soon discovered to form a closely 
related clade, very distincl from other assemblages 
(e.g„ ''grandicornis'' group) within the generic com- 
plex tiyate Rathke ( sens, lat. ). Since members of this 
complex are apparently confined to the North Atlantic 
and Mediterranean regions, and enrirdy cxtralimital to 
the North PaciEc, a separate publication for this group 
was deemed advisable. 

The type species Hyate pomlea Raihke, 3 837, was 
described origi nally from the coast of the Krym (Crim- 
ean) peninsula, Black Sea. Since that time, workers 
who found a 2/>Yi/e-Jike animal with characterise call j 
strong, robust, striated spine on the distal end of per- 
aeopodai propods, were convinced they were dealing 
with this same species, be it from the Mediterranean or 
the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. As in many other 
similar cases, a striking and ea.sily visible character 
often leads to a quick identifl cation, without careful 
further examination and, in a second step, to being 
I abel led as a "cosnwpol i tan " s peci es. A second species 
of this group had been been descril>edfrom the British 


of the "cosmopolitan syndrome”, this species fiad been 
sy nonymized with Hyale pontica Rathke by many sub- 
sequent workers (e.g., Slcbbing 1906; Chevreux & 
Fage 1925;Gurjanova 1951 ; Bulycheva 1957; Lincoln 
1979; Barnard & Karaman 1991; and Krapp-Schickd 
1993). G.O. Sars (1890) was a notable exception, 
maintaining separate identity of 7/. iuhbockkma based 
on material from Norxvay. Further taxonomic dispari- 
ties w ere more recently noted in material at hand from 
the Mediterranean region and Bermuda, 

The purpose of this study is to unravel the true 
identity of the various s|3ecies within the Hyak pomica 
complex, and describe new forms, based on character 
states both newly discovered and previously utilized. 
HyaJid amphipod collections in the Verona Museum 
contain a beautiful mating pair of animals from the 
Bosphonis {entrance to the Black Sea). Thus, character 
states of the true Hyale pomica Rathke could be estab- 
lished and differences with other material worked out.

Systeinatics: 

Rathke (1837) established the genus Hya/e after 
having described his type species H. ponftca from the 
Black Sea. Shortly afterwards. Bate ( 1 857) described, 
under several different generic names, a similar spe- 
cies, from the British Isles. It seems that 

Stebbing must have seen material of liMoc^iana and 
thought it Identical with ffya/e pcmliCci Rathke as well 
as W. iublfockiartij Bale. He synonymized them, 
keeping the older name of course. In 1893 Della Valle 
offered draw ings of and "pomka’', but 

he mixed material of nilssa/ti as well as MicropyMa 


ranna/a, and the drawings are not pertinent to the 
Atlantic species f/. /Mochtuia. 

In 1 906 Stebbi n g redescri bed the femal e of ' r/W', 
Chevreux& Page (1925) cite*‘pOrtifcfl"'from the Atlan- 
tic and from the Mediterranean coast of France, in a 
paper on Mediterranean (Marseilles) species of 
Giovaniiini (1965) prov ided detailed drawings (the text 
has some errors) of ?p(vikca that may be the most 
clearly executed until now. Mateus & Mateus (1966) 
stressed the necessity of a revision of all genera of 
families HyaJidae and Hyalellidae before the abundant 
material of the Calypso expedition could be worked up. 
Thus, in Lincoln's ( 1 979) figures of'poitr/ca'" from the 
British Islands, palmar corners are very weak in 
gnathopods 1 , 2 ( 9 ) and peraeopods, while there is a 
clear comer in those of Chevreux & Page's table (C? 
6mm). FinalEy, Krapp-Schickel (1993) fully treated 
material ofpori/ica from the Mediterranean Sea,

ginal cusp, lacking in coxae 1 and 4. Coxa 5 markedly 
anterolobate; 6 7 posterolobate. Coxal gilts me- 

dium. rounded, sac-like, largest on peraeopod 5. 

Onathopods sexually dimorphic. GnathopcxJ I (C?), 
propodal palm short, variously overhung by simple 
dactyl; carpal lobe narrow; propod with mediofacial 
guiding (bracing) spine; dactyl simple. Gnathopod 2 
(cf), basis with strong ante rod istal lobe (= hydrody- 
namic lobe of Bousfteld & Kendrycks 2003); carpal 
lobe lacking; propid large, narrowing distal Jy, palm 
with slight hinge tooth. 

Peraeopods short, stout; bases expanded, posterior 
margins crenulate, hind margins of t>eraeopods 5 and 6 
with weak surge seta and notch. Peraeopod 5, segment 
4 short, broad; segment 5 often short; segment 6 with 
single large striated subierminal anierodistal clasping 
(locking) spine, and 1-2 small accessory spines; dactyl

apices rounded: marginal setae medium-long, hook- 
ti pped . Peraeon 2, pream pi exi ng notch large, rectan - 
gular, lacking unguisial grcjove, with small locking slit 
above anterior margin of notch. 

DJstribution<il Ecology: Open surf coasts of the Medt* 


eluding Great Britain, and Norway, also Bermuda; 
clinging to algae and other substrata at I.W level and 
subtidally to 50 m. 

Remarks: Species of Hyak sens, str, differ markedly 
from those of (Bousfield &. Hendry cks, 2002) 

in being mainly aquatic and subtidal. They occur 
mostly in strongly lotic waters of open surf coasts, and 
saltate (hop) in air weakly or not at all (see Sars 1 890), 
Mature females of Hyak possess regularly rounded 
brood plates with longish marginal hooked setae, 
whereas those Apohyale have very broad, a pi cal ly 
acute brood plates with nun^rous short marginal hook- 
tipj>ed setae. 

Species of Hyak are apparently uniquely adapted to 
a lifestyle in strongly lotic waters such as the surt zone 
of open coasts. Thus, the lip of the large propodal 
median facial guiding spine (d') appears to fit into a 
locking slit on peraeon 2 (9), thereby enhancing the 
grip of the gnathopod w^hen the dactyl closes on the 
preamplesing notch. In apparent homoplasious man- 
ner. the preainplexing mechanism within genus Hyak 
rcsembl es that of some s pec! es w i thin genus AUorchestes 
(e.g., .4. angas!a Stebbmg)(family Hyalellidae)-

Distributional Ecology^: Exposed rocky coasts of the 
Mediterranean, Bosphorus, and Black Seas: among 
algae, littoral to Infralittoral; not common. Not con- 
firmed from the open Atlantic coa,st where it appears to 
be replaced by H. labbtyckiutta. 

Remarks; H. poniica has not been found in the North- 
ern ,Adriatic Sea, despite careful sampling by several 
authors. Some Mediterranean endemics apparendy 
live exclusively in the Adriatic Sea, whereas other 
endemics live everywhere else but there. 

Previous treatments of H ponrica lequire clarifica- 
tion. Thus, Krapp-Schickel (1993 p. 735, fig. 503) 
illustrates gnathopod 2 of an obviously penultimate cf. 
The other gnathopod 2 (same specimen) showed a 
much more transverse palm, well defined by a short 
robust spine on the palmar comer. Gnathopod I (C? ) 
bears a stout ''guiding spine^^ on the medial surface of 


the propod (not figured). 

Bulycheva (1957, pp, 90-92, fig. 30) illustrates a 
inaKill i ped apparently of quite different form. The dif- 
ference may be attributable to the position of the max- 
illiped within the buccal mass. Thus, the terminal 
segments of the palp may be tumetl or twisted ai a right 
angle to the vertical basal plates on the slide, and their 
size in the illustration would depend on the amount of 
pressure on the cover slip during preparation. On the 
other hand. Bulycheva's material (not examined in this 
study) may represent a different taxon. Her specimens 
apparently have less stout peraeopods, and tlie male 
gnathopod is of rather different form than material 
from the Mediterranean and Bosphorus regions.

Immature specimens (3.5 mm). Immature material 
collected off Capo Caccia^ Sardina, by TK-S, is not 
referable to Hyale poniia^ from the Bosphorus region 
(Fig. 6). It diffeoi in the less distal and more perpen- 
dicular position of the main clasping spine on segment 
6 of peraeopods 3-7 and the less elongate dactyl and 
unguis of the maxilliped palp. These character .states 
are more similar to mature specimens from this general 
region figured as '"Hyale pontica** by Giovaninni 
{ l%5) (Fig. 7) and by Chevreux & Page (1925) from 
Port Vend res on the Mediterranean coast 

In addition to regular aJlometric growth differences 
in numbers of antennal flagel lar segments, fewer n umber 
of spines and setae on appendages, and undeveloped 
secondary sexual character states of the gnathopods 
and peraeon 2, tlie immature differs i n the undeveloped

or partially developed hydrodynamic lobes of the 
gnathopods, and unusually large apical spines of

Distributional Ecology : Western Mediterranean re- 
gion; apparently living interstitial ly in coarse sand, 
from 0 to 25m depth. 

Etymology: The authors are especially grateful to 
Aldo Michelini , for creative solutions to virtually every 
problem concerning transport, human connections, 
shrewdness^ and for his always w ide and open heart. 
We are pleased to name this species in hts honour. 

Remarks: Description of a new species based mainly 
on immature material at hand involves some taxonomic 
risk. Relatively small differences distinguish Hyale 
pontfca and H. lnbbockiana. We noted also that bona 
fide specimens of H. pontica co-occur at the same 
locality (Capo Caccia, Sardinia), but were collected in 
short, stiff brown algae of the suri' zone, whereas the 
presently descril>ed material occurred mainly in the 
interstitiumoron epiphytes and Baic^wwjspp. to depths 
of 25m. Separate taxonomic status of H. mfcheiiiii 
would seem justified. 

Illustrations of "'fiyaU pontica" provided by 
G io vann i n i ( 1 965 ) are very detai led. I n aJ I si gni f leant 
taxonomic respects they correspond to our material. 
The long and slender propeds of gnathopods I and 2 of 
ovigerous females appear to be diagnostic character 
states of Hyale michelini. 

Descriptions and drawings by Chevreux &. Page 
( 1 925) do not entirely fit atiy of our st>ecies. as there 
are several differences which might have been omitted 
or actually lacking (e.g., cusps on posterior margins of 
coxal plates, clasping spine on gnathopod I (d’), only 
one group of spines on peimeopods 3-7 (inner margin of 
segment 6) or simplification of sha|)e of coxae 5 and 7. 
1 he shape of antenna 2 (c?) (groups of dense setae) or 
sharply angled propodal palm of peraeopod 7 would 
suggest Hyale pontica , but only one group of spines on 
the inner margin of the propod is figured. The shape 
of gnathopod 2 (d) is similar to H. iitbbockiatia or/f. 
tnichelini^ and the body length applies to all of them.

Remarks, On character states of gnathopod 1 and 
peraeopod segment 6, this species is dearly a member 
of the pontica group of h valid amphiprxis. Full descrip- 
tion and formal naming of the species awaits acquisi- 
tion of additional material. 

S. E. Johnson (1986) has synonymized Kunkel's 
material with Far hyale hawaiensU (Dana, 1853). Ma- 
terial of the latter species from beach drift at Flungi^ 
Bay, Bermuda, has been carefully figured by Slock 
(1987) and bears a remarkable similarity to "Hyale 
pontica" of Kiinkel (loc. cit., fig, 26). Furthermore, 
photographs of Kunkel's figured male specimen and 
appendages , kindly provided by Dr. Eric Lazo- Wasem 
(Y PM), leave little doubt that Par hyale, and not Hyale, 
is the genus in question. 

In addition to Par hyale hawaiensis, widely distrib- 
uted in tide pool drift debris (Johnson 1986; Stock 
1 987), and Hyale sp, from lotic water habitats at LW

level near St. George's, two additional hyalid species 
have been Identified in CM IV collections from Ber- 
muda: 

( 1 ) A species of Protohyak, erroneously attributed to 
Hvak pomlca by ELB, having stout distal peraeopodal 
clasping spines, elongate antenna 2, and uropod disto- 
lateral spine, occurs in LW pools at Outer Castle Island. 

(2) A small saltating species of kpokyk occurs com- 
monly in supi^ittoraJ tide pools at Devonshire Bay. 

Di^ussion 

Comparison of principal taxonomic character states 
within genus Hyak Rathke sens. str. (Table 1) suggests 
that the four known species may be divided into two 
principal subgroups; (i) ponnea subgoup, and (it) 
htbbockiana subgroup. 

The former consists of the singJc relatively ad- 
vanced generic type species, H. pomica. The latter 
encompasses the three more primitive species, M mick 
eiini n. sp., H, iiibk'xkmm^ and Hyaie sp.,of which M 
hibbocklana entrains the greatest number of plesio- 
morphic character states. 

As noted in the key and in Table I, Hyaie pontka is 
especially distinctive in character states of gnathopod 
J (c?); distal position and oblique angle of clasping 
spine and angled "palmar" margin of peraeopods 3-7; 
and strongly setose flagellum of antenna 2 (<S). It 
shares relatively few character states with H. iubbock- 
iatm which, in view of previous confusion of the two 
species by several authors, is a somewhat surprising 
revelation of this study. 


Bottsfield & Hendrycks (2002, p. 124) have per- 
formed a semiphyletic cluster analysis of 1 1 of the 12 
known genera within family Hyalidae. In balance of 
character states, the genus Hyaie is relatively advanced 
but quite distinct from all other genera, ll is perhaps 
least remote from the Apea/tyde complex, but is special- 
ized for a life style in open lotic waters. Such features 
include the unique form of guiding and locking spines 
on the propod of gnathopod !(<?), and corresponding 
preamplexing notch and locking slit of peraeon 2 (9); 
well -developed hydrodynamic lobes of gnathopod 2; 
strong dactyls and strong clasping spines of pemeopods 
3-7; and rounded form of epimeral plate 1 . 

The ancestry^ of genus Hyaie remains moot. Al- 
though component species are "swimmers", the bal- 
ance of character states suggests a relatively close 
relationship with genus Apohyak, especially with the 
subgroup of A, prevosii (nifssoni) in which hydrody- 
namic lobes of the gnathopods are strongly devetoped* 
and distal spines on the peduncle of uropod I are not 
strongly developed. On a somew hat broader phyletic 
basis, the form of the sw i mmi n g s peci es withi n H y al i dae, 
of which the life styles of genera Hyaie, Frotohyak and 
Parallorchesref! aie esprecially representative, reflects 
the basic hydnxlynamicform of pri m iti ve " Natanti a"(see 
also Bousfield and Hendrycks 2002). 

On the other hand, the genus Hyaie and especially 
species pofiiica, evinces similarities with the special- 
ized hyalid subfamily Kuriinae. As noted in Bousfield 
& Hendrycks (2002, p. 1 1 9) character state similarities 
include su bean nation and/or imbrication of body seg- 
ments; cren Illation of coxal and basal plate margins;

presence of posterior mEirginai cusps on coxae 2 & 3 
only, and specialized form of the maxilliped palp. 
Hyale ponHca also overlaps geographically with 
Micropythia and abuts the more southerly range of 
Kuria hngirTianns. 

The four known species of genus Hyale exhibit a 
relati vel y restri cted geographi cal di stri b u tion. Speci es 
are confined to high salinity outer coast I otic water 
sw^ash zones of temperate and subtropical NE Atlantic 
and Mediien^nean regions. However, these habitats 
are relatively poorly collected and studied. Further 
records might be anticipated from open ocean coasts of 
Spain. Portugal, and island archipelagos off the coast of 
North Africa, including the Canaries and the Azores, 

Myers' (1991) analysis of family groups within 
corophioidean and melitoidean amphipods of the Ha- 
waiian Archipelago underscores the need to consider 
phyletic age of a taxonomic group as a facttsr in devel- 
op! ng hypothetical dispersal patterns and biogeo- 
graphic fau nal rel ati ons hi ps. Character state anal ysi s 
suggests that within family Hyalidae, members of 
genus Hyale are a relative recently evolved group of 


species. Their present confinement within the eastern 
North Atlantic and Mediterranean regions seemingly 
conforms with a relatively recent geotecEonic origin of 
those basi ns duri n g Cretaceous ti mes ( Ho wraith 1981).
