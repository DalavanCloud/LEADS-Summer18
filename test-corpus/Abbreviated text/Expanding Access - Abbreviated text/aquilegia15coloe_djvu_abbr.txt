Low-elevation Biodiversity 


Tim Hogan 

University of Colorado Herbarium 

During the past several years I have had 
the good fortune to work on floristic 
projects in the Eagles Nest/Gore Range 
Wilderness Area and the City of 
Boulder Mountain Parks. The Eagles 
Nest is a 135,000 acre high elevation 
Wilderness Area that extends from the 
lower subalpine zone up to tundra- 
topped peaks of over 13,000 feet. In con- 
trast, the Boulder Mountain Parks is a 
7,000 acre montane area that reaches 
from the plains to 8,000 foot summits. In 
the course of this work I have had the 
opportunity to compare a relatively 
small, low elevation preserve with a 
large “rock- and-ice wilderness.” 

Although the high elevation wilderness 
is nearly twenty times larger than the low 
elevation park, it is striking that the 
same number of species (ca. 400) were 
documented in each area. Furthermore, 
at least nine species in the Boulder 
Mountain Parks are listed by the 
Colorado Natural Areas Program as 
Species of Special Concern. These in- 
clude Betula papyrifera, Botrypus vir~ 
ginianus, Cylactis pubescens, Lilium 
philadelphicum, Listera convallarioides, 
Malaxis monophyllos, Pyrola picta, 
Smilax lasioneura, and Viola pedatifida. 
Although my work in the Eagles Nest 
helped to fill a void in our records at the 


University of Colorado Herbarium, the 
most remarkable result of that work was 
how typical the flora of that Wilderness 
Area is in relation to other alpine 
regions in the state. 

There is a great deal of talk these days 
about the preservation of biodiversity. 
In employing this term, conservation 
biologists are attempting to embrace the 
full diversity of life: not just the diversity 
of species numbers, but also the genetic 
diversity within and among populations, 
and the ecosystem diversity across 
landscapes. Nevertheless, species num- 
bers often serve as a useful indicator of 
biodiversity in the broader sense. For 
this reason alone, the results from the 
two floristic projects indicate that the 
smaller, low elevation study area serves 


a conservation role disproportionate to 
its size. 

Another reason that low elevation sites 
in Colorado are important for the 
preservation of our native species is 
their significance for animal popula- 
tions. Many animal species are limited 
by bottlenecks in the annual cycle — 
times when their food is limited or shel- 
ter from the elements is most 
precarious. Low elevation natural areas 
often provide the habitat these species 
need to survive the rigors of cold, 
drought, and famine. As botanists we do 
not need to be reminded that our floral 
riches are often as dependent on pol- 
linators and animal dispersal as they are 
on water and soil.

Ferrets in Little Snake? 


The BLM is proposing to amend the Lit- 
tle Snake Resource Management Plan 
because of a proposed reintroduction of 
black-footed ferrets. Ferrets would be 
reintroduced into northwestern Moffat 
County, Colorado, as a non-essential ex- 
perimental population. The environ- 
mental assessment and plan 
modifications would determine what 
restrictions on other resources will be 
necessary and what effects such restric- 
tions will have on other uses of the Little 
Snake Resource Area. 




The planning criterion for amending the 
management plan is “to establish a 
management objective which provides 
for black-footed ferret reintroduction 
while not adversely impacting other 
resources or uses.” BLM has identified 
the following general issues to be ad- 
dressed: access to public lands. 


economic and social conditions, 
threatened and endangered species, ran- 
geland uses, recreation uses, wildlife 
habitat management, mineral explora- 
tion and development, and public rights- 
of-way. 

BLM requests interested or affected 
parties to participate in this process by 
sending their specific comments for 
receipt by October 11, 1991. Comments 
may address issues above, effects on 
resources, and/or raise additional issues 
to be considered in the amendment 
process.

Brome Reminder 


If you have information about the 
naturalization of smooth brome, it’s not 
too late to contact Gary Finstad, who is 
compiling it for the Society and has 
received few direct responses to date. 

Gary is even willing to discuss general 
observations and opinions, as well as any 
facts and locations you can provide. You 
can reach him at 236-2702 (days) or 791-

The First Collection i 

William A. Weber 

University of Colorado Herbarium 

Harold Dahnke was rummaging around 
in the COLO herbarium recently and 
found a specimen ofAlisma triviale col- 
lected in Boulder County wetlands just 
west of Baseline Lake by Joe Ewan in 
1941. This in itself is not surprising. But 
Ewan had noted on the label that it was 
growing, among other plants, with 
Spiranthes. This had to be S. diluvialis. 
However, we could not find any 
specimen of a Spiranthes collected by 
him. The Alisma must have been a 
specimen left behind when Joe took his 
large personal herbarium with him 
when he left the University. We 
wondered whether Joe merely saw the 
orchid or whether he might have col- 
lected a specimen. 

I wrote immediately to Joe, who has 
retired and is now at the Missouri 
Botanical Garden, and asked him if his 
field notes might tell us whether there 
was a specimen collected. I did not get 
a reply directly, but I heard very quick- 
ly from the curator of the herbarium at 
Tulane University, who sent me a copy 
of the pertinent page from Joe’s field 
notes, and a photocopy of the actual 
specimen, which is at Tulane with the 
rest of the Ewan Herbarium. And, of 
course, it is Spiranthes diluvialis^ col- 
lected almost 45 years before the species 
was discovered and described in 1984! 

Maybe there is a moral to the story, or a 
lesson, or something. When we work on 
the floristic level, Colorado collections 
in other herbaria are almost impossible 
to learn about. It would be helpful if col- 
lectors of the Colorado Flora would 
pass their collections through the her- 
barium of record where new records 
might be noted. Joe Ewan took his her- 
barium with him before there was a real 
herbarium of record here, and had he 
left his herbarium in Boulder, there is no 
guarantee that it would have been safe. 
Likewise, the huge collection made by 
Francis Potter Daniels on which he 
based his book, the Flora of Boulder 


Spiranthes diluvialis 


County, is in the University of Missouri 
herbarium, with a partial set in Field 
Museum. When I first worked on the 
Boulder County flora, I had to borrow 
the entire collection from Missouri, and 
several critical specimens could not be 
found. 

The situation is different now; the her- 
barium is safe, the flora is under serious 
study by numbers of people concerned 
with records, and a comprehensive 
catalog is about to be published. But still 
there are those collectors who evidently 
treasure their private collections more 
than they do the science to which the 
collections might contribute. 

Time and again someone tells me that 
such and such a species grows in Kiowa 
or Logan County, and why don’t I say so 
in my handbooks? The answer is, of 
course, that unless it is in the herbarium, 
it doesn’t exist, because at the present 
time our published statements have to 
be based on fact. I hope that we soon will 
see the day when sight records of at least 
common and easily recognized plants 
will be acceptable as herbarium records, 
just as they are in ornithology, but a 
generation of good field botanists must 
be trained to the task before it happens. 
Meanwhile, in every state of the union, 
plant collectors should, as a matter of 
scientific method, see to it that their col- 
lections are at least offered to the her- 
barium of record, even if only one or two 
might be retained there. ^

Biodiversity, continued from page 1 


The current wilderness legislation in 
Congress fails to protect many low 
elevation areas deserving of designa- 
tion. It is easier for politicians to set 
aside areas poor in water, timber, and 
mineral resources than it is to defend 
biologically rich wilderness. Areas such 
as Kannah Creek, middle and lower 
Sandbench, Troublesome, Ute Creek, 
additions to the South San Juans, and 
the Rainbow Trail on the east slopes of 
the Sangre de Cristos are neglected 
under the current wilderness proposal. 
I have taken two wonderful backpack 
trips along the crest of the Sangres this 
summer, and I am happy that this area 
is slated for wilderness designation. But 
if alpine environments are to retain their 
ecological integrity and not be turned 
into islands in the sky, they must also be 
protected along their flanks and 
shoulders. 

As members of the Native Plant Society 
we can play an active role in the preser- 
vation of natural areas in Colorado. As 
a collective voice, we possess a 
legitimacy to which policy makers will 
respond. As individuals who are in- 
timate with unspoiled places 
throughout the state, we are in a position 
to identify these areas and speak out 
when they are threatened. Sometimes 
these will be large areas nominated for 
wilderness designation. With the up- 
coming BLM Wilderness Proposal, this 
will be of critical importance in the near 
future. At other times the areas will be 
more modest in size, but still of critical 
importance. Perhaps we are all some- 
what culpable for the lack of low eleva- 
tion sites under wilderness protection; 
we have not done a good enough job in 
educating our elected officials and fel- 
low citizens of their ecological and 
evolutionary significance. 

I chose to work in the Eagles Nest 
Wilderness because of my abiding love 
for high places, perennial snowfields, 
sweeping rock, glaciated topography, 
and alpine forget-me-nots. My ap- 
preciation for softer, more subtle 
landscapes has developed more slowly. 
I remember eating my lunch one day in 
a small drainage on the northwest side 
of Green Mountain in the Boulder 


Mountain Parks. It was cool beneath the 
mixed forest and the silence was only ex- 
aggerated by a small stream in the bot- 
tom and the occasional call of a kinglet. 
I realized that a change had occurred in 
my perception and that my measure of 
beauty was no longer restricted to alpine 
landscapes. Beauty had been expanded 
for me, and the summits of my youth 
would no longer be complete without 
the forests, woodlands, and meadows 
that I had only come to know through 
the slow and patient botanizing of these 
environs.

We are living at a critical point in his- 
tory. Human population growth and our 
impact on the earth must be addressed 
if the massive assault on species, 
landscapes, and traditional cultures is to 
be slowed. The Colorado Native Plant 
Society and its members have both the 
expertise and the responsibility to speak 
out for the preservation of specific sites 
and the overall diversity of life on the 
planet.

CONPS Workshops — 1991-1992 Season 


Fall and Winter Workshops 

Botanical Illustration II 
Saturday, October 12, 1991 



Leader: Carolyn Crawford 

Our first workshop on Botanical Il- 
lustration proved so popular, Carolyn 
Crawford has agreed to present a more 
advanced workshop. Drawing and dis- 
section of fall fruits will be the emphasis 
of this workshop. Fruits of VituSy Par- 
thenocissus, Smilax, Crataegus, Malus, 
etc., will be available to draw. 


In addition to the techniques of colored 
pencil and pen & ink, Carolyn will 
demonstrate her main medium, pastel 
pencil. It is planned to have a guest in- 
structor present watercolor techniques 
as well, but this is not confirmed. 

To be held at Foothills Nature Center, 
Boulder,

tend to fill up fast. If demand is suffi- 
cient, multiple sessions will be 
scheduled if the instructor is willing. 
Registrants will be notified by mail 
about two weeks before the workshop 
regarding session date, locaiton, lunch, 
supplies, suggested references, etc. 


Orchids of Colorado 
Saturday, December 7, 1991 

Bill Jennings 


^ As currently understood, there are 24 
species of orchids native to Colorado, 
with three more known from within 75 
miles of the state line in Nebraska or 
New Mexico. Although the identifica- 
tion of most Colorado species is 
straightforward, the bog orchid group 
(genus Limnorchis, also known as 
Platanthera or Habenaria) is very com- 
plicated and agreement between 


taxonomists is non-existent. In 
temperate North America, orchids are 
nowhere common and numerous very 
rare species are in the family. Best 
known for showy flowers from tropical 
plants, many Colorado species are in- 
stead rather drab. 

To be held at the Denver Botanic Gar- 
dens, Denver. 


Unless othenwse noted, the fee for each 
full-day workshop is $8 for members 
and $16 for non-members ($8 for mem- 
bership and $8 for the workshop). 
Please hold payments until the day of 
the workshop. 


Genus Draba in Colorado 
Saturday, January 11, 1992 



Leader: Dr. Robert Price 

The Colorado Native Plant Society is 
fortunate to be able to bring Dr. Price 
back to Colorado to present this 
workshop. A Colorado native, his early 
work in genus Draba was done in 
Colorado. Now at Indiana University, 
he will present the latest research in this 
interesting genus in the mustard family 
(Brassicaceae). 


A special lecture will be presented 
Friday night, January 10, at a location to 
be determined. If demand is sufficient, 
a second section of the workshop will be 
held Sunday, January 12. 

Workshop to be held at the University 
of Colorado, Boulder (special thanks to 
Tom Ranker). 


Additional workshops tentatively 
scheduled for winter 1992 include 

Montane and Subalpine Grasses 

G^iiVLS Astragalus in Colorado 

Colorado Ferns 

Taxonomy and Cultivation of Native 
North American Rhododendrons 

Adopt-a-Rare-PIant Workshop. 

As plans are confirmed, winter 
workshops will be announced in later is- 
sues of Aquilega. jf.

Exotic Tree Willows in Colorado: 

Thoughts on the Reproductive Ecology of Crack and White Willows ^ 

Pat Shafroth, Jonathan Friedman, and Mike Scott 

Anyone who has walked, jogged, or 


hiked along a stream that drains the 
Front Range has probably passed 
sizable willow {Salix sp.) trees. Two 
large tree willows in our area are the 
crack or brittle willow {Salix fragilis) and 
the white willow or golden osier (Salix 
alba var. vitellina). Both species attain 
considerable size, often greater than 40 
feet in height and 3 feet in diameter. 

Crack willow, the more common of the 
two, can be distinguished from white 
willow by its smooth, ascending, olive- 
green branches. White willow has gold- 
en yellow twigs and brownish yellow 
branches. Also, the branches and twigs 
of crack willow are very brittle at the 
base; hence its common name. Both of 
these species are introduced, and some 
claim that what we refer to as crack wil- 
low is actually a hybrid between S. 
fragilis and S. alba. Peachleaf willow (S. 
amygdaloides) is a native tree willow 
that grows in similar habitats, but has a 
smaller stature than crack or white wil- 
low, rarely exceeding 40 feet. Other ex- 
otic tree willows that might occasionally 
occur in riparian areas are the weeping 
willow (S. babylonica) and the globe wil- 
low (S. matsudana). 

Natives of Eurasia, crack and white wil- 
lows were introduced to colonial 
America where they were used as fast 
growing sources of shade, timber, gun- 
powder charcoal, basket withes, and 
also for erosion control and windbreaks. 
They have become naturalized in most 
of southeastern Canada and the eastern 
U.S. Presumably crack and white wil- 
lows were brought to Colorado by set- 
tlers in the late 1800’s. The oldest trees 
occur near long-established cities, 
towns, ranches, and farm houses. In fact, 
large crack willows are often the most 
prominent remnants of abandoned 
homesteads. The species apparently es- 
caped cultivation and became success- 
fully established along reaches of rivers 
and irrigation ditches. Crack willow was 
either more widely planted or has 
reproduced more successfully than 
white willow, as it is more abundant in 
our state. 


This May we noticed that all of the crack 
willows in a reach along Boulder Creek 
bore female catkins, while all of the 
white willows bore male catkins. The 
scarcity of male crack willows in North 
America was previously noted by H. D. 
Harrington in Manual of the Plants of 
Colorado and by R. A. Vines in Trees of 
East Texas. We decided to survey 
several reaches along some of the major 
Front Range drainages (Boulder Creek, 
Cache la Poudre River, Cherry Creek, 
South Platte River, Plum Creek) in an 
effort to verify this curious 
phenomenon. Of 2320 crack willows 
surveyed, we found only 3 males, and of 
152 white willows, we found only 2 
females. In addition, we found apparent 
hybrids of both sexes along sections of 
Plum Creek, Cherry Creek and the 
Cache la Poudre River. 

Our findings prompted us to 
hypothesize about the reproductive 
ecology of these species, especially 
crack willow. The extremely skewed sex 
ratios and apparent absence of very 
small individuals led us to believe that 
crack willow is reproducing primarily 
vegetatively. Along Plum Creek near the 
town of Sedalia, lone crack willows typi- 
cally punctuate the upstream ends of 
depositional bars in the stream channel. 
Apparently, branches that have cracked 
off larger trees have become lodged and 
rooted in the sandy channel, later trap- 
ping sediment and helping form bars. 

Along Cherry Creek in southeast Den- 
ver, young crack willows are present on 
the edges (especially upstream) of small 
rock check dams. These trees may have 
arisen from branches that were stopped 
in the check dam backwaters. Other 
authors have noted crack willow’s ability 
to reproduce from fallen branches and 
twigs (e.g.. The Complete Guide to 
Trees of Britain and Northern Europe 
by A. Mitchell, and Some American 
Trees by W. B. Werthner). 

We remained puzzled about why crack 
willows are apparently rarely reproduc- 
ing by seed. We reasoned that, since 
there are so few males, the females are 


rarely pollinated, and therefore the seed 
is almost entirely sterile, or aborts. In 
fact, we found an average of 2.95 seeds 
per capsule in a sample of 20 catkins col- 
lected along the Cache la Poudre River. 
To our surprise, more than 87% of 1000 
seeds germinated in petri dishes. Be- 
cause we collected many of the catkins 
from stands of purely female in- 
dividuals, we feel that crack willow may 
be forming seed apomicticly; that is, 
producing viable seed without fertiliza- 
tion. Alternatively, female trees may 
simply be receiving pollen from some 
relatively nearby male white or crack 
willows. 

Crack willows may occasionally become 
established from seed, but apparently 
the conditions necessary for their estab- 
lishment and survival are almost never 
met. Genetic defects could also inhibit 
the survival of crack willow seedlings. 
However, seedlings that we planted in 
wet sand in early June are now (mid- 
August) 3-5 cm tall and experiencing 
low mortality. We hope to conduct ex- 
periments in the future to identify what 
factors are preventing more widespread 
seed reproduction. 

Clearly, many questions regarding crack 
willow reproductive ecology remain un- 
answered. Our speculations and con- 
clusions are based on limited 
observations. We welcome any informa- 
tion CONPS members may have on the 
history of crack and white willows in 
Colorado, or the locations of male crack 
willows, female white willows, or 
hybrids. Only through more observation 
and experimentation will we be able to 
unravel this interesting botanical story.

Plan now to attend the Society’s annual 
meeting, November 2nd at the Denver 
Museum of Natural History (DMNH). 
This exciting program explores one of 
our most threatened, and most 
neglected, vegetation types— the North 
American prairie. 

The destruction and loss of diversity 
now occurring in the tropical rainforests 
parallels the history of North America 
during the development and conquest 
of our native grasslands. Speakers will 
, go beyond botanical emphasis to ex- 
plore the relationships among plant 
communities, animals, and the early and 
modern human inhabitants of the 
prairies of the United States. An overall 
historical viewpoint will lend the 
program a sense of how sweeping chan- 
ges occurred to this once-vast biome, 
and how we can help protect and restore 
the ecosystems of the Great Plains. 

The Denver Museum of Natural History 
is co-sponsoring this discussion of the 
1 grassland ecosystems that are an impor- 
tant part of Colorado’s history — and its 
future.

Bill Jennings 

Some information on rare plants from 
the summer of 1991 has already been 
received. As the Adopt-A-Rare-Plant 
volunteers conclude their studies, there 
will be more reports on Colorado rare 
plants. 

Limnorchis ensifolia (Limnorchis 
sparsiflora sensu latu) 

We can now add Chaffee County to the 
list of counties where sparsely-flowered 
bog orchid occurs. A small population 
was seen on private land near Buena 
Vista in early August. The landowner 
was interested in selling his holdings to 
The Nature Conservancy. Both Rick 
Brune and I had checked the property. 

Unmounted specimens seen at RM in- 
dicate the presence of this orchid in the 
Flat Tops area, probably Garfield 
County. 

Epipactis gigantea 

As predicted, this orchid has finally 
been discovered in the seeps along the 
Dolores River. There is a line of seeps 
at the Wingate/Chinle contact on the 
east side of Sewemup Mesa in the 
Dolores River Canyon. Many of these 
seeps are accessible to those willing to 
do some climbing, but there is one right 
at roadside about 16 miles north of 
Uravan. A large pullout with trash cans 
marks the spot. Underneath an over- 
hang, there are a few plants of maiden- 
hair fern. However, as one walks 
upstream along the road, the seep line 
gains altitude quickly. About 150 paces 
up the road, the seep line is about 30 feet 
up the cliff. It is at this point that the or- 
chid was observed. The climb up to the 
plants is not particularly difficult. 

Erigeron kachinensis 

This diminutive daisy is in the same seep 
as the Epipactis ^gantea. There are 
plants next to the orchid, but there is one 
clump lower on the cliff, so that it can be 
accessed by climbing up only one ledge, 
about 6 to 8 feet above road level. In ad- 
dition, more plants were seen in a less 
accessible spot, a few hundred feet fur- 
ther upstream. Some climbing is neces- 


The Search for Rare Plants 


sary to get to this location, as the seep is 
getting further up the cliff as one goes 
upstream. 

Other sites for Kachina daisy are in Bull 
Canyon and Coyote Wash, tributaries of 
the Dolores River, in Slick Rock 
Canyon. There is no road along the 
Dolores in this part of the canyon. In the 
past, dirt and gravel roads made these 
sites relatively accessible, but with the 
cessation of uranium mining in the area, 
neither the BLM nor Montrose County 
is maintaining these roads, and they 
have washed out. Lengthy hikes are now 
necessary to access this portion of the 
Dolores. The BLM has signs in the area 
that Slick Rock Canyon is under study 
as a wilderness area. 

Listera borealis 


Two new sites were discovered this year. 
Sandy Righter found this little orchid on 
the Two Elk Pass Trail, near Vail in 
Eagle County on July 14. This is the first 
report for Eagle County. I found north- 
ern twayblade in Larimer County, north 
of Chambers Lake in the Laramie River 
drainage, visiting the site June 22, July 3, 
and July 10. At this site, all three 
Colorado species of Listera grow 
together. This is the first report for 
Larimer County. There are now eleven 
sites in nine counties. 

Listera convallarioides 

This little twayblade was found growing 
with the other two species of Listera in a 
roadside seep north of Chambers Lake. 
Although previously known from 
Larimer County (Rocky Mountain Na- 
tional Park), this new site increases the 
number of known Colorado populations 
to five. Other colonies are in Boulder 
and Routt Counties. 

A literature report for this species was 
investigated by Dr. William A. Weber. 
A specimen housed in the Herbarium 
Boissier, Geneva, collected in Colorado 
during the 1890’s was reported to be 
Listera convallarioides^ but a photocopy 
of the specimen conclusively showed it 
to be the common Listera cordata. 


Cypripedium fasciculatum 

Funding by the USDA Forest Service 
this year enabled me to study this plant. 
Populations in Rocky Mountain Nation- 
al Park, near Glendevey in the Laramie 
River area, on the east side of the Park 
Range near Buffalo Pass, south of Rab- 
bit Ears Pass, and near Grand Lake 
were recovered. The population near 
Buffalo Pass had an estimated 1000 
plants, nearly all in bloom. Sandy 
Righter found two previously undocu- 
mented populations, based on reports 
by Diana Mullineaux and Mary Ellen 
Gilliland. These sites are in Eagle and 
Summit Counties. Sandy also located a 
new population in Eagle County last 
year. This orchid is known from 16 sites 
in Jackson, Larimer, Boulder, Routt, 
Grand, Summit, and Eagle Counties. 
Based on literature reports, it may be 
more common in Colorado than 
anywhere else in its range. 

Lilium phiiadelphicum ^ 

I also studied this species with funds 
from the Forest Service. Historically, 
most specimens of this plant have been 
taken in Larimer, Boulder, and Jeffer- 
son Counties. However, most 
specimens are very old and label data 
are scanty. I found no plants at most 
documented sites, but I heard of 
numerous populations through the 
grapevine. It appears that most existing 
populations of wood lily are given de 
facto protection by being on private land 
and thus inaccessible to the general 
public. There are sites in the National 
Forest west of Fort Collins; north of 
Nederland; and south of Sedalia. 

This plant is so showy it attracts im- 
mediate attention and is frequently 
picked or transplanted. At one site on 
public land, a woman was observed with 
a bouquet of flowers that included the 
lily. Close examination of that lily patch 
indicated both picking and trampling. 
Although there are numerous popul? 
tions in northern Colorado, all patchcr-^ 
examined were less than 150 plants, 
typically about 50 to 75. It should never 
be picked.
