70. BERBERIDACEAE. Barberry Family 

The importance of this family in Peru centers about Berberis lutea 
and relatives, the "ccarhuascassa" or "palo amarillo," sometimes 
called "espino amarillo," whose yellow wood, with that ofBocconia, 
furnishes the beautiful, yellow dye seen in ponchos and other clothing 
to this day (Ruiz & Pavdri). 

1. BERBERIS L. Barberry 

Reference: Schneider, Bull. Herb. Boiss. II. 5: 33^*8, 133-148, 
391-403, 449-464, 655-670, and 800-831. 1904-1905. 

Shrubs with or without spines, these typically trifurcate. Leaves 

, simple in the Peruvian species, fasciculate, entire or more or less 

l aculeate-dentate. Flowers yellow or reddish yellow, variously dis- 

r- posed, with 3-4, most often 6, deciduous sepals and usually as many 

petals, these biglandular within. Filaments as many as the petals, 

. dentate or edentate. Ovules 1-12, laterally inserted at the base of 

< the 1-celled ovary, the fruit 2-3-seeded. Schneider has given a 
' careful and discriminating account of the Andean forms which, 
5 however, with more knowledge, probably will be found to constitute 

fewer species. For the purposes of this work it has seemed practical 

to follow earlier authors and group the forms primarily according to 

y> the nature of the inflorescence, which for well developed specimens 

^ of nearly all species is quite obvious. It may be stated that the work 

^ of P. E. Citerne, cited several times on the following pages, is a 

thesis of the Faculty des Sciences de Paris, Se"rie B, No. 183. 1892, 

very rare and sometimes filed in libraries under this citation. 

v? Omitted from the following synopsis is the name B. rotunda 

~ Macbr. Candollea 6: 3. 1934, which, as casual observation of the 

type has shown, has nothing in common with this family except 

; a certain similarity in foliage. Because of this, the specimen had 

w been laid in a cover with species of Berberis described the same 

< evening and perhaps flowers of Berberis became mixed with the 
* aberrant sheet. 

Flowers racemose (sometimes very shortly so), racemose-corymbose, 

or paniculate. 

^ Flowers borne in more or less peduncled panicles.

Berberis Benoistiana Macbr., sp. nov. 

B. agapatensis Lechl. similis, glabra; foliis ellipticis basi fere 
rotundatis infra medium usque ad apicem sparse spinuloso-dentatis, 
ad 4 cm. longis, 3 cm. latis, subtus perobscure nervatis haud reticu- 
latis perdense papillosis; sepalis fere 6 mm. longis; petalis ca. 4 mm. 
longis. At one time referred to Lechler's species of southern Peru, 
and obviously closely allied, but that shrub is somewhat puberulent 
and the strongly reticulate-veined leaves are relatively less papillose. 
The papillae on the under leaf surface of the new species are so 
abundant that they seem to form a tissue. Moreover, the habitat 
is strikingly different. B. Benoistiana was found on a fog-drenched 
summit in open, mossy places. A slender shrub, 1 meter high, the

ately spreading, little flexuous; spines slender, straight, spreading, 
usually trifid, about 15 mm. long; leaves 5-8-fasciculate, obovate- 
cuneate, sessile or subsessile, pale green, concolorous, entire, thinly 
callous-margined, subcoriaceous, mostly 12 mm. long and 5 mm.

pillose; flowers in short racemes or subcorymbs, these 1-1.5 cm. long; 
pedicels obscurely but obviously puberulent, 2-3 mm. long; open 
flowers 4-5 mm. broad, the obovate sepals and petals subequal, 
about 3 mm. long; stigma large, sessile. Type collected by Pentland 
in Bolivia, near the Peruvian boundary. B. Keissleriana Schneid., 
808, of Bolivia has linear-spatulate leaves, definitely papillose 
beneath; B. Rechingeri Schneid., 808, similar, has broader, epapillose 
leaves, and simple or no spines. Neg. 34507.

Berberis brumalis Macbr. Candollea 6: 4. 1934. 

Glabrous, the long, yellowish green, nearly terete branches 
unarmed; leaves 5-7-fasciculate; petioles short-dilated at the base, 
strongly canaliculate, about 7 mm. long, articulate below the elliptic- 
oval blade, this about 4 cm. long and 2 cm. wide, rounded-acute 
at the base, spinulose-cuspidate at the apex, the revolute margin 
entire or with 2-3 remote, spinulose teeth, coriaceous, lustrous and 
obscurely reticulate- veined above, dull, paler, scarcely veiny but 
papillose beneath; pedicels 1 mm. long, glabrous; sepals and petals 
scarcely 3.5 mm. long, minutely ciliate; stamens apparently almost 
2 mm. long, the connective strongly produced. The type has no 
inflorescence, but has one dissected flower. The position of the 
species now appears to me to be doubtful. In leaves it simulates 
species with fasciculate flowers, but it matches no species seen by me.

Glabrous, with trifid spines and black branchlets; blades coria- 
ceous, obovate-oblong, coarsely spinescent-serrate, 3-6.5 cm. long, 
1.5-2.5 cm. wide, lustrous above, papillose beneath and with light 
yellow nerves; petioles 2-8 mm. long; racemes sessile, lax, to 5 cm.

3-5 mm. wide, the petals nearly as large; stamens 3.5 mm. long, the 
connective obtuse; ovary 3 mm. long; style obsolete; ovules 2. 
Compared by the author withB. pichinchensis Turcz., with pubescent 
racemes. B. Trollii Diels, of Bolivia, has leaves 2-3 cm. wide, 
racemes 1.5-2 cm. long, and pedicels 5-6 mm. long.

Berberis flexuosa R. & P. Fl. Peruv. 3: 52. pi. 281. 1802; 812. 

A densely branched shrub 2 meters high; branchlets slender, 
virgate, little angled, distinctly flexuous; spines slender, trifid, 1-3 
cm. long; leaves elliptic-obovate, acute at the short petiole, entire 
or with 2-3 teeth near the apex, becoming about 3 cm. long, 1.5 (-2) 
cm. wide, at maturity loosely reticulate-veined on both sides, papil- 
lose, especially above, paler and dull beneath; racemes (2-) 4-6 cm. 



FLORA OF PERU 673 

long, rather densely but obscurely puberulent; bractlets, even in age, 
puberulent, sessile, ovate-aristulate; pedicels finally 5-8 mm. long; 
flowers pale yellow, scarcely 5 mm. long; stamen connective pro- 
duced; style obvious; ovules 3-4; young berry lageniform. There 
may be two forms on the type sheet at Madrid, although all the 
material is referred by Diels to the type without question. The 
smaller branchlet has obovate leaves only 1.5 cm. long and 7 mm. 
wide, faintly veined, but apparently young; inflorescence 4-flowered, 
almost glabrous. The stem is very flexuous, as on the other branch, 
which doubtless is to be taken as the exact type. Neg. 12988. Ruiz 
and Pavon gave Tarma, Cheuchin, and Pillao as localities. The 
Paris Dombey material is much better. B. papillosa Benoist of 
Ecuador, which might be sought here, has larger leaves lustrous 
above, white-glaucescent beneath, and spinulose-dentate toward the 
apex. B. Rechingeri Schneid., 808, of Bolivia, has simple spines and 
leaves only half as large. My No. 1285, distributed as B. mono- 
sperma, had dark blue fruit used locally to make ink.

Similar to B. lutea, to which it could be referred as a variety, 
but at least the younger leaves conspicuously glaucous beneath; 
spines none, or trifid and rarely 9 mm. long; leaves to 2.5 cm. long, 
5-8 mm. wide, often 3-5-spinulose-dentate at the apex, densely 
granular-papillose beneath and above but the papillae often hidden 
by glaucous wax; bracts slightly ciliate; pedicels 1.5-3 cm. long, 
glabrous. Negs. 14313, 29227.

Berberis Humbertiana Macbr., sp. nov. 

Frutex glaberrimus; ramis vel ramulis virgatis haud flexuosis 
teretibus; spinis trifidis sat validis ca. 5 mm. longis; foliis fasciculatis 
sessilibus cuneato-obovatis apice 3-angulato-spinuloso-dentatis vel 
interdum lanceolatis, fere integerrimis et acuto-mucronatis, cartilagi- 
neo-marginatis, rigido-coriaceis, supra paullo nitidulis, subtus opacis 
prominente papillosis obscure laxeque reticulatis, 8-10 mm. longis 
4-5 mm. latis; racemis 6-15 mm. longis; pedicellis 2-2.5 mm. longis; 
floribus 4-6; sepalis subrotundatis cum petalis vix 3 mm. longis; sta- 
minibus obscure apiculatis; stylis nullis; fructibus globosis. With 
a superficial resemblance to B. lutea and its allies, this shrub is 
closely related to B. Keissleriana Schneid., 808, as remarked by 
Schneider on the type sheet, but that Bolivian plant is puberulent, 
has definitely petioled, narrower leaves, and more numerous flowers. 
B. Wettsteiniana Schneid., 809, similar, has much larger leaves, 
racemes to 4 cm. long, the flowers 6 mm. broad, on pedicels 3-5 mm. 
long. Citerne had given the Peruvian plant a herbarium name 
without, however, indicating the characters. It may commemorate 
the furtherance of botanical science by Professor H. Humbert, 
Director of the botanical museum, Museum of Natural History, Paris.
