• 

The extension of the scope of the Kational Museum during the past 
few years, and the activity of the collectors sent out in its interests, 
have caused a great increase in tlie amount of material in its possession. 
Many of the objects gathered are of a novel and imijortant character, 
and serve to throw a new light upon the study of nature and of man. 

The importance to science of i)rompt publication of descriptions of 
this material led to the establishment, in 1878, of the present series of 
publications, entitled "Proceedings of the United States National Mu- 
seum," the distinguishing peculiarity of which is that the articles are 
published in signatures as soou as matter sufficient to All sixteen pages 
has been obtained and printed. The date of publication being i)laiuly 
expressed in each signature, the ready settlement of questions of priority 
is assured. 

The articles in this series consist: First, of papers prepared by the 
scientitic corps of the National Museum ; secondly, of papers by others, 
Ibnnded upon the collections in the National Museum; and, finally, of 
interesting facts and memoranda from the correspondence of the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

The Ijul'etins of the National Museum, the publication of which was 
commenced in 1875, consist of elaborate papers (monographs of families 
of animals, &c.), while the present series contemplates the prompt pub- 
lication of freshly acquired facts relating to biology, anthropology, and 
geology ; descriptions of restricted groups of animals and plants ; the 
settlement of particular questions relative to the synonymy of species, 
and the diaries of minor expeditions. 

This series of publications was commenced in 1878, Avith volume I, 
under the title "Proceedings of the United States National Museum," 
by the authority and at the expense of the Interior Department, and 
under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The present volume, constituting the fifth of the series, has been pre- 
pared under the editorial suiiervision of Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, curator 
of the department of fishes.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SOME FOSSIIi TREES IN THE INITE© 
STATES NATIONAIi MUSEUM.

WAED, U. S. A. 

[Letter to General William T. Sherman. J 

Sir : I have the honor to furnish you the following information with, 
regard to the two fossil trees iirocured from "Lithodendron" at the re- 
quest of Lieut. Col. P. T. Swaine, Fifteenth Infantry : 

On or about the middle of May, 1879, the honor was conferred upon 
me to carry out written instructions received from General Sherman, 
with regard to procifring several specimens of fossil trees from "Litho- 
dendron" for the National Museum. A sergeant, ten men, and two 
drivers, rationed for twelve days, with teams and two heavy stone 
wagons, were ordered to accompany me on the expedition, taking with 
them such tools as would be necessary to procure and handle the spec- 
imens. We made the usual drives, stopping at a forage agency each 
night until we arrived at Navajoe Springs, Arizona. 

The country passed over was very dry and dusty, though the road 
was in good condition, being the regular mail route to Prescott. 

At Navajoe Springs we left the road, cutting diagonally across the 
country about 20 miles, arriving at Bear Spring near the head of Litho- 
dendron in the evening. We had to cross several aroyas, but being 
in the dry season, we had nothing to fear from water or marshy soil. 
The country traversed was desolate and barren, sage-brush and pinon 
trees abounding, good grazing and water being very scarce. Here and 
there mountain peaks stood out in bold relief like great sign-posts to 
guide the traveler on his way. The water, when found, was in small 
quantities and alkaline. 

Near the head of Lithodendron, and about Bear Spring, grazing was 

good, the Navajoes having thousands of heads of sheep there which 

they drove to the spring every morning and evening ; being always on 

the qui vive for news, they thought it strange the "Great Father in

Washington" should want some of the bones of the "Great Giant" 
their forefathers had killed years ago when taking possession of the 
country, the lava beds being the remains of the blood that ran from his 
wounds. 

Camping at Bear Spring, I turned the mules out to graze and left the 
men to prepare an early dinner whilst I rode down the valley to examine 
the thousands of specimens that lay scattered on each side of the A^alley 
along the slopes, which were perhaps 50 feet high ; the valley of the 
Lithodendron, at its widest part, being scarcely a half mile. Along 
the slopes no vegetation whatever Avas to be seen, wood being very 
scarce; the soil was composed of clay and sand mostly, and these petri- 
factions, broken into millions of pieces, lay scattered all adown these 
slopes. Some of the large fossil trees were well preserved, though the 
action of the heat and cold had broken most of them in sections from 
2 to 10 feet long, and some of these must have been immense trees; 
measaring the exposed parts of several they varied from 150 to 200 feet 
in length, and from 2 to li feet in diameter, the centers often containing 
most beautiful quartz crystals. 

I encountered considerable difficulty in trying to procure two speci- 
mens answering to the General's description, and which I thought would 
please. After finding the larger of the two fossils sent, I could find no 
mate, the remainder being of a different species, and the exi)osed part 
broken in segments too short to answer. Finally, I concluded to unearth 
part of the same specimen, which entered the ground at an angle of 
about 20^. 

Bringing back men and teams, I dug along some 30 feet, finding the 
second dark specimen, which made a good match, and which saw the 
light, perhaps, for the first time for ages, though both were parts of the 
same tree. This was on the right bank or slope of Lithodendron, one 
mile and a quarter from Bear Spring. I got both fossils loaded on 
the wagons, and camped at the Spring that night. 

iSText morning we left quite early, encountering some difficulty in 
getting over the rough country, frequently stopping to make a road to 
get on a mesa or over some aroya ; late the same evening we arrived at 
Xavajoe Springs. 

From here we encountered no further difiiculties. Arriving at the 
post 1 reported my return and the result of the expedition. (The post 
was Fort Wingate, K. Mex.) 

These specimens remained at the post until Colonel Bull, in Sei)tember, 
1879, had them boxed up and sent to Santa Fe, :N"ew Mexico. From 
there they were shipped east to Washington, I believe. 
Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

HISTORY OF THE TWO SPECIMENS OF FOSSIL TREES IN THE SMITH- 
SONIAN INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, D. C. 

The General of the Army, General W. T. Sherman, while on a tour 
across the continent in the fall of 1878, snggested to Lieut. Col. P. T. 
Swaine, Fifteenth United States Infantry, then in command of the post 
of Fort Wingate, K. Mex., the expediency of procuring two of the pet- 
rifactions of the country in that vicinity of reasonable dimensions for 
transportation, yet sufdciently large to be worthy of a place in the 
Smithsonian Institution. Acting upon this snggestion, an expedition 
was organized early in the spring of 1879 to proceed to the Lithodeudron 
(stone ^trees) in Arizona. Thomas V. Kearns, a gentleman of long 
residence in that part of the country, and familiar with the locality to 
be explored,- kindly volunteered Ids services, and success was, in a great 
measure, due to his efforts in carrying out the wishes of the General. 
The military detaU consisted of Second Lieut. J. T. C. Hegewald, one 
sergeant, and twelve soldiers, all of the Fifteenth United States Infantry, 
and the party was well supplied with army wagon running gears spe- 
cially arranged for hauling stone, and with tools and appliances complete. 
Lieutenant Hegewald has furnished a detailed and comprehensive 
statement of the events connected with this expedition, which is inter- 
esting as an appendix to this paper. 

Only one of the two specimens obtained from the Lithodeudron by 
Mr. Kearns and Lieutenant Hegewald was forwarded to Washington. 
This is the large dark-colored one. In the place of the second one 
brought in from the locality of the Lithodeudron a better specimen was 
found on the Mesa to the north of and adjacent to Fort Wingate, 
about two miles irom the flag-staff. This is the smaller and lighter 
colored one. 

First. Lieut. S. R. Stafford, regimental quartermaster, Fifteenth 
United States Infantry, had a strong platform made of plank spiked 
together, and rolled each fossil on separately, fastening them in place 
with strap iron, and hauled them to Santa Fe, N. Mex., where they were 
detained in the government corral awaiting the collection of enough 
other curiosities to make up a car load, when they were shipped to 
Washington under the direction and care of agents of the Smithsonian.

A STUKYOF THE PHRONIHIW-IE OF THE .\ORTJI PACIFIC SUKVEV- 
IIV« EXPEOITI©I\. 

By THO§. II. STKEET§, M, !>., U. S. IV. 

The identification of the Fhrouimw has been attended with difficulty 
on account of the absence of properly-defined characters. Glaus, who 
gives the most detailed account of them, combines in his description of 
P. sedentaria more than one species. I have had no opportunity to 
examine P. sedentaria. The following article is the result of close 



4 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

study, and comparisons of a number of specimens of each species; and 
the specilic characters here presented and figured were found to be con- 
stant, and apply to all sizes. 

The family characteristics are as follows : 

Head broad and rounded above, tapering below to the oral appara- 
tus. Eyes on the dorsal and lateral surlaces of the head. Both pairs 
of autenuaj present in the male, and long; in the female the inferior 
pair obsolete, and the superior pair short. Thorax broad anteriorly, and 
tapering posteriorly. The first and second pairs of thoracic feet short; 
the extremity of the fourth joint being more or less produced, and the 
fifth joint with a pair of wing-like appendages on either side of its 
apex. The fifth pair of thoracic feet developed into a stout, prehensile 
organ. The remaining pairs of feet simple. Abdomen narrow. The 
caudal appendages slender, cylindrical, and two-branched. 

There is a very marked resemblance among the Phrommidce. The 
family characters are many; the generic and specific characters are 
few, but constant. 

The eggs of the female are carried in an incubatory pouch between 
the posterior thoracic feet. Females with the young in every stage of 
development within the eggs may be found swimming free; yet when 
the young leave the eggs, they are always found, I believe, inside the 
body of a Fyrosoma, a Beroe, or a Medusa, which the female am])hipod 
appropriates as a home for her immature species. The parent and young 
are usually found inclosed in the same case. The former by this action 
manifests, apparently, a maternal solicitude for the welfare of her off- 
spring. This is interesting as appearing in animals so low in the scale 
of being as the am])liipods. 

There was observed a great disparity between the number of males 
and females collected in any locality. In the preparation of this article 
there were examined forty-five specimens belonging to the different ge- 
nera of the family, and the proportion of males to females was found to 
be as 1 to 8. Until quite recently the male form — being so different — was 
not recognized as belonging to the same species. The discovery Avas 

made by Clans. 

Phronima, Latreille. 

Head, thorax, and abdomen as described under Phronimidcv. The 
first and second pairs of thoracic feet short and slender, with the fourth, 
or carpal joint hroadhj liroduccd; the third and fourth pairs long, sim- 
j^le, and subequal. The fifth pair stoutly developed, and provided with 
a strong ineliensile organ, resemhling the claw of some of the Cancridw. 
The last two pairs of legs shorter than the preceding, and subequal. 
The three pairs of caudal appendages long and slender, each furnished 
with two lanceolate branches. Telson short. 

Sexual differences. — Males smaller than the females. In the female 
the inferior antennre are absent. In the position of these organs — be- 
neath the lateral eye — is a broad, rounded prominence, slightly pro- 
jecting beyond the anterior margin of the head. The apex of this 



PROCEEDINGS OF UXITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEmi. 5 

prominence usually bears a single sliort hair. The superior autenuce 
are short and three-jointed, the last joint being beset with a few audi- 
tory hairs. In the male both pairs of antenuiTe are present, and are 
provided with long, flexible llagella; the last joint of the peduncle of 
the superior pair long, as in the female, but much more robust, and 
densely furnished with hairs; the peduncle of the inferior pair three- 
jointed. The abdomen of the male is stouter, and the bases of the 
swimming feet more nearly rounded; in the female the basal portion of 
these feet are oblong-ovate, and the last segment of the thorax is longer 
and narrower than the corresponding part in the male.

Female. — The first and second joints of the peduncle of the superior an- 
tenme S'hort; the last more than twice the length of the first two. The 
first and second i)airs of thoracic feet with the carpal joint jjroduced an- 
tero-inferiorly, and the produced portion evenlj^ set with sharp spines 
along its anterior edge; the following joint, which antagonizes with the 
produced portion of the preceding, slightly arched and spinous along its 
inferior edge; the last joint notched below the end, and furnished with 
a ribbed, pectinated appendage on either side of its base; the third joint 
prolonged anteriorly below, truncated, and set around with short, sharp 
bristles or spines. The second pair of legs longer than the first. The 
third and fourth pairs with the basal joint armed behind, at its ex- 
tremity, with a sharj) spine ; the basal joint of the fifth pair armed in 
the same manner as the two preceding, but the spine is mnch larger in 
the former; there is likewise a spine on the middle of the following 
joint, in front. The third joint of the fifth pair enlarged, arched above, 
and lengthened; the fourth joint, or palm, long, attenuated at its articu- 
lation with the third, and gradually broadening to its junction with the 
fifth joint, arched above, the inferior angle produced anteriorly into a 
long and stout i)oint, corresponding to the immovable finger of the 
Cancridw, the anterior border with two stout, ]irominent teeth, the 
upper the larger, tuberculated on the edge towards the movable finger, 
and beset with a few bristles or hairs; the fifth joint, or movable finger, 
longer than the anterior border of the palm, arched above, and with a 
broad prominence on the middle? of the inferior margin; the last joint 
very small, and in old subjects fused with the preceding joint. The 
basal joint of the sixth and seventh pairs of legs armed at the ex- 
tremity, in front, with a short spine; and the second and third joints of 
the last pair with a prominent, rounded projection on the anterior 
surface, that on the second joint more pointed. The first pair of caudal 
appendages extending almost as far backward as the extremity of the 



G PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

third pair; tlie second pair falling short of the articulation of the rami 
of the third pair, and terminating about opposite the articulation of the 
rami of the first i)air. Tel sou minute, uuguiform. 

Male. — The fifth pair of thoracic legs relatively shorter in the male; 
all the joints of the leg individually shorter and stouter than the corre- 
sponding parts in the female. The produced portion of the fourth joint, 
corresponding with the immovable finger of a crab, more produced 
downward, and less anteriorly, and arises from about the middle of the 
inferior surface. The fifth joint is more curved at its proximal extrem- 
ity, so as to antagonize with the produced portion of the fourth joint. 
These sexual characters of the fifth pair of legs are only developed in 
the mature male; in the young of this sex, the fifth pair partakes of the 
characters, more or less, of the young female. 

There were examined twenty-eight specimens of this species, coming 
from many different localities in the Pacific Ocean, varying in length 
from 4 to 21""", and there was found no material variation in the struc- 
tural character of the prehensile organ, dependent upon age (presuming 
the size of the specimen to be dependent upon its age) ; that of 4"'™, as 
well as that of 21'""\ presenting all the essential characteristics of the 
si)ecies as described and figured by Gueriu. The shape of the hand 



as deep posteriorly as anteriorly, and all the joints are relatively shorter 
and stouter. As the animal increases in size the parts become length- 
ened, and the hand is much narrower posteriorly than anteriorly. In 
one specimen only, did the teeth on the anterior surface of the hand 
show any variation; in that, the detached tooth, nearest the produced 
portion, was wanting. P. custos, probably, represents this occasional 
variation. In another example, the prominence on the concave surface 
of the movable finger was very prominent, almost tooth-like. With these 
exceptions, I fonnd no tendency to variation in these parts, which is 
contrary to the researches of Claus. According to this authority, P. 
atlantica is nothing more than the immature female form of P. sedentaria. 
I think, however, that the A^alidity of the species will no longer be ques- 
tioned, now that the male form of P. atlantica is presented. 

Locality (of those examined): Pacific Ocean, north and south of the 
equator, from latitude 30° 42' south to 37° north; and from longitude 
81° 40' west to 1()0^ 25' west. The temperature of the water varied 
from GOO to 79° Fahr.

of the first aud second combined. The structure of the first and second 
pairs of thoracic feet simihir to those of P. atlantica. The spine on the 
posterior extremity of the basal joint of the third and fourth pairs is 
wanting- in the present species, and in its place is a bristle-like hair. 
The fifth pair of legs are relatively shorter, when compared with those 
of aUanilca ; a prominent spine on the posterior extreuiity of tlie basal 
joint, but none on the following joint, in front; the third joint short, 
broad, and considerably arched above; the fourtli joint (palm) broadly 
quadrate, almost as broad as long, the superior border rounded pos- 
teriorly to the articulation of the third joint, the lower border slightly 
curved, the character of the dentition on the anterior border si!)iilar to 
that of atlantica in the general arrangement of the teeth, but the teeth 
are not nearly so prominent, or pointed, the lower, single tooth but 
slightly separated from the larger crenulated tubercle; the prolonged 
inferior angle more curved upward, and shorter than in the former spe- 
cies. The fifth joint curved, about as long as the anterior margin of 
the palm, a low convexity on the inferior margin. The first ])air of 
caudal appendages do not reach as far backward as the third pair, ex- 
tending to, or slightly beyond, the middle of the rami of the last pair; 
the second pair extends to, or slightly beyond, the point of articulation 
of the rami of the third jiair, and more than half way the length of the 
branches of the first pair. 

The characters of the fifth, or prehensile pair of legs, and the rela 
tive length of the second pair of caudal ai>pendages are sui^eient to 
readily distinguish this species from P. atlantica. 

In the young of S'""" the shape of the hand is the same as in the 
adult. On the anterior margin there are, in the place of the den- 
tated tubercle, two or three pointed teeth, springing from a slightly 
elevated base. The hand of the male is similar to that of the female, 
except that the immovable finger rises from a more receding angle, 
which, however, is less receding than that observed in P. atlantica. 

Clans confuses this species with P. sedentaria. ( Vide Zeitschrift wis- 
sen. Zoologie, Leipzig, 1872, xxii, pis. xxvi, xxvii, fig. 1-12.) 

The number of specimens examined was ten — nine females and one 
male. Their lengths varied from 3 to 12"'™. 

Locality. — Pacific Ocean, north and south of the equator — from lat 
itude 40° north to 30^ 42' south; and from longitude 97° 14' west to 
157° 37' west. The temperature of the water of the localities whence 
the specimens were obtained varied from GG° to 73° Fahr. 

The following facts may be deduced by comparison with P. atlantica. 
The present species is smaller in size, less numeroxis in the localities 
given, and a relatively larger i)roi)ortion of those in the collection came 
from localities south of the equator.

thoracic feet long — much longer than the succeeding pair. The fifth 
pair euhirged, and used for prehension ; the extremiti/, or claw, reHemhling

anterior aspect of the palm, which is furnished with teeth. Three pairs 
of styliform caudal appendages:* the second, or middle pair short, or 
rudimentary. 

Sexual differences. — Males smaller than the females, and more robust. 
In the females the second pair of caudal appendages are rudimentary, 
almost obsolete; in the males well developed. 

In respect to the antennje and other parts of the body the sexual 
differences are similar to those observed in Phronima.

than the second, with the fourth joint hardly produced at its posterior 
distal extremity, the produced portion spine-like; the second pair with 
the fourth joint elongate and slender, and with the spine on the pos-

smaller than that on the corresponding joint of the first pair. The 
third pair of thoracic feet extremely elongate, nearly as long as tiie 
animal, the excessive lengthening being in tlie last two joints ; the 
bases of the third and fourth x)airs of feet spinous along the posterior 
edge. The base of the fifth, or prehensile, pair longer than that of the 
preceding pairs, and spinous on the anterior edge, two or three spines 
on the posterior edge near the distal extremity; the anterior edge of 
the second, third, and fourtli joints spinous; the fourth joint enlarged 
at its extremity, and armed with four or five large teeth, against which 
the following joint, or finger, impinges; the lowest of the teeth the 
largest, and touches the finger about its middle; the fifth joint about 
one-third the length of the fourth, arched; the claws of all the pairs of 
feet anchylosed with the fifth joint, and fixed at a right angle to it, form- 
ing a hook, and the apex of the fifth joint slightly produced as a straight, 
acute spine. The bases of the last two pairs somewhat club-shaped,

clearly represented.

breast and sides marked with roundish, elliptical, or tear-shaped spots 
of the same, the spots largest on the breast, where sometimes more or 
less blended. Bill black, the basal portion of the mandible more brown-

2. MIMUS GILVUS LAWEEXCEI. 

Ch. — Differing from true M. (jiJvus in much longer wing and tail, de- 
cidedly smaller and slenderer bill, decidedly lighter and browner gray 
of upper parts, much less distinct light superciliary stri])e, and other 
details of coloration. From var. (p'ociUs is much less distinctly black 
wings, with less sharply contrasted light markings, u^iper parts browner, 
the bill smaller and more slender, etc. 

Adult: Above uniform brownish gray (much as in M. polyglottiis, hut 
rather browner); wings and tail dusky (not black), the greater coverts 
and remiges broadly edged with brownish gray (like the back), the mid- 
dle and greater wing-coverts distinctly tipped with white (forming two 
uarrow bands), and the extreme base of the primaries white, usually, 
however, concealed by the i)rimary coverts; three to five outer tail- 
feathers abruptly tipped with white, this 1.40-1 .65 inches in extent on 
the outer feather, which has. the outer web mostly or entirely white; 
the middle rectrices narrowly and indistinctly whitish or pale grayish at 
extreme tips. A very indistinct paler superciliary stripe, strongly con- 
trasted only with the dusky lores ; an indistinct dusky jiost-ocular streak ; 
eyelids pure white. Lower parts dull white, purer on the throat and 
belly, the jugulnm shaded with pale grayish, the flanks and anal-region, 
sometimes the crissum also, more or less strongly tinged with buff. Bill,

The bird described above is a well-marked race, apparently referable 
to M. (/ilvus, tbougb ijossibly (witb M. gracilis, Cabanis, of Yucatan, 
Guatemala, and Honduras) distinct speciiically. A considerable number 
of specimens of the various forms referred by authors to M. gilvus, rep- 
resenting many localities, have been examined in this connection, and the 
result appears to justify the subdivision of that species into several 



A. Whitish superciliary stripe very distinct. 

a. gilvus. Above dark brownish gray, general outer surface of the 
wings not distinctly darker. Wing 3.85-4.40 (4.08), tail 
3.90-5.00 (4.39), culmen .70-.80 (.73), tarsus 1.18-1.32 (1.27),

Sta. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Martini<iue.* (10 specimens exam- 
ined.) 

/?. melanopterus. Above much lighter gray, the wings distinctly 
darker, by reason of narrower iialer edgings. Wing 4 60-4.75, 
(4.67), tail 4.80-5.30 (5.12), culmen .72-.80 (.77), tarsus 1.35- 
1.38 (1.30), middle toe .88-1.00 (.92). iTflft.— Venezuela and 
Colombia. (4 specimens.) 

B. Superciliary stripe very indistinct. 

y. gracilis. Above deep gray (about intermediate in shade betAveeu 
gilvus and melanopterus), the wings pure black, in abrupt and 
very conspicuous contrast, and with the clear white markings 
very sharply defined. Wing 4.15-4.80 (4.49), tail 5.00-5.80 
(5.38), culmen .70-.75 (.72), tarsus 1.20-1.37 (1.31), middle toe

4. SIALIA STALIS GUATEMAL.^.* 

Ch. — Similar to 8. sialis of the eastern Uuited States, but with de- 
cidedly longer wing and tail, the cinnamon of breast, etc., paler; 9 
with the back decidedly bluish. 

(? adult : Above uniform rich cobalt blue (exactly as in S. sialis), the 
sbafts of the rectrices and remiges deep black, and the ends of the 
primaries dusky black. Chin, throat, breast, sides, and flanks, pale 
cinnamon ; abdomen white ; anal region and lower tail-coverts white, 
the latter tinged with blue, and with dusky shafts. Bill and feet deep 
black ; iris brown. Wing 4.15-4.40, tail 2.80-3.00, culmen .50, tarsus 
.80-.S5, middle toe .G2-.65. 

9 adult : xlbove dull grayish blue, more brownish across the nape ; 
feathers of i)ileum and back with blackish shaft-streaks (obsolete in 
winter plumage) ; rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail, bright blue, lighter 
and more greenish than in the <?; wings dull blue; throat, jugulum, 
breast, sides, and flanks, pale dull cinnamon; abdomen, anal region, 
and crissam, white. Bill, tarsi, and toes, black; iris, brown. Wing 
4.00-4.10, tail 2.70-2.80. 

Hab. — Highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. 

A considerable series of specimens of Guatemalan Bluebirds are 
quite uniform in their characters, as described above. It is somewhat 
strange that this extreme southern form should resemble much more 
closely in colors the true >S'. sialis of the eastern United States than the 
»S'. azurea of eastern Mexico, but such is nevertheless the case. Speci- 
mens in the National Museum collection are from central Guatemala 
("Cobaa to Clusec"), and Vera Paz (Tactic and Cobau). I have not 
seen a specimen from Honduras, but the birds of that country are prob- 
ably identical with those from Guatemala. 

5. CHAMPA FASCIATA HENSHAWI. 

Cn. — Dilfering from C. fasciata of the coast district of California in 
very much paler and grayer colors. Above brownish gray, becoming 
decidedly ashy on sides of head and neck, the tail showing very indis- 
tinct narrow transverse bars of a darker shade (quite obsolete in some 
specimens). Beneath pale vinaceous-buft", more or less tinged with 
pale ashy, especially on the sides. Wing 2.20-2.50, tail 3.20-3.70, cul-

14 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Hah. — Interior districts of California, including west slope of Sierra 
Nevada; north to Sacramento, south to Walker's Basin, Tejon Mts., 
and San Diego. 

The differences in coloration between this interior form and the coast 

race (true fasciafa) are very striking on comparison of si)ecimens, and 

may be briefly tabulated as follows: 

Var. FASCIATA. Above deep umber-brown, more grayish on side of 

head and neck; beneath deep cinnamon-butt", or light cinnamon, 

the throat and jugulum more or less distinctly streaked with dusky 

or grayish. Wing 2.20-2.G0, tail 3.20-3.70, culmen .40-.45, tarsus 

1.00-1.10. Hab.—Conat of California, south to Sta. Chira, north to 

or beyond Nicasio. 

Var. HENSHAWI. Above brownish gray or grayish brown, the sides 

of head and neck decidedly ashy; beneath pale cinnamon-buff, or 

pale vinaceous-buff', usually more or less suffused with pale ashy, 

the darker streaks on jugulum, etc., nearly or quite obsolete. Wing 

2.20-2.50, tail 3.20-3.70, culmen .40-.45,"^ tarsus .95-1.05. Rah.— 

Interior of California, including western slope of Sierra Nevada. 

As may be seen from the above measurements (taken from seven 

adult specimens of fasciata and eight of ItensJiaici), the dimensions of 

the two forms are essentially identical. The extreme development of 

the characters distinguishing C. henshawi is seen in specimens from 

Walker's Basin and the Tejon Mts., collected by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, 

tp whom this new form is dedicated. Specimens from Sacramento are 

darker, but still not enough so to make them referable to the coast form, 

to which all specimens from Stockton seem to belong. The darkest ex- 

amjiles of C. fasciata^ as restricted, come from the coast district north of 

San Francisco Bay (Nicasio, Marin Co., C. A. Allen).

6. PERISOEEUS CANADENSIS NIGEICAPILLUS. 

Ch. — Similar to P. canadensis fumifrons in darkuessof coloration, but 
forehead, lores, chin, throat, and sides of neck distinctly white, in marked 
and abrupt contrast with the dark color of adjacent parts ; crown, occi- 
put, and upper part of auricular region decidedly black, with little or no 
admixture of slaty anteriorly. Differing from true canadensis in much 
darker coloration throughout, much blacker crown, black auriculars, 
less extensive white area on forehead, and more marked contrast of the 
white portions of head and neck, with adjacent darker colors. 

$ adult : (No. 85950, U. S. Nat. Mus. Labrador, Apr. 2, 1880; " Schnei- 
der"; presented by Dr. L. Stejneger.) Whole forehead (back to about 
.75 of an inch from the anterior points of the nasal tufts), lores, malar 
region, chin, throat, and sides of neck soiled white, many of the feathers 
of the chin and throat having black shafts; crown and occiput, with 
upi)er and posterior j^ortions of auricular region, deep black, somewhat 
mixed with slaty anteriorly and posteriorly. Upper parts dark dull slate, 
lighter and more grayish on the nape, and changing to plumbeous on 
the secondaries and tail-feathers, all of which are narrowly bordered at 
.ends with white, which is about .25 of an inch wide on lateral rectrices; 
X^rimaries edged with grayish white beyond their sinuations. Lower 
parts dark bi'ownish gray, quite abrupth^ defined against the soiled 
white of the jugulum. Bill and leet deep black. Wing, 5.40; the pri- 
maries 1.10 longer than secondaries; tail, 5.30, its gradation only .75; 
culmen, .85 ; tarsus, 1.40 ; middle toe, .05. 

It is only after very careful comparison with numerous specimens of 
the true P. canadensis from Maine, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Min- 
nesota, and various localities in the interior of British America, and of 
an even larger series of P. canadensis fumifrons from Alaska, that I have 
concluded to base a new geographical race of this species upon the 
single specimen described above. That I am fully justified in doing 
so is evident from the fact that not one specimen among nearly 100 adult 
birds of this genus resembles very closely the specimen in question. In 
all probability the form to which the present specimen belongs inhabits 
the coast -district of Labrador, and would thus represent on the- Atlantic 
side the littoral race of Alaska, called P. canadensis fumifrons. 



SYIVOPSIS OF THE WKST IIVUBAIV MYAWESTES. 
By I.E01VHARD STEJIVEGER.

the wing-structure among species of the West Indian group, typified by 

* So tlie name is origiuallj' spelt by Swaixson, and as /.ivain found besides /nultx, I 
have preferred the older form to Agassiz's restoration. 



16 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

M. fjcniharhis Swains., led me into a further examination of the species 
of this section of the genus, with the aid of additional material. The 
inspection of the fine series of specimens, which, through the kindness 
of the authorities of the U. S. National Museum, I have been enabled 
to bring together, has resulted in a discovery of such interesting rela- 
tionships between the forms in question, that I have concluded to put 
my notes into the shape of a monograph of all the West Indian species. 

The National Museum collection, while i)robably more comi>lete than 
any other, is still lacking in specimens from a large number of the West 
Indian Islands.t Mr. George N. Lawrence, of New York City, has 
kindly placed at my disposal his entire collection of species of this genus. 
Mr. J. A. Allen, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, 
Mass., has loaned me seven specimens from the island of Sta. Lucia, 
while Mr. C. B. Cory, of Boston, has generously put in my hands the 
unique type of his M. montanus, from Haiti. These, together with the 
collection of the National Museum, make a series of 35 specimens, which 
represent very satisfactorily all the forms herein described, with the 
exception of M. montanus. 

I desire to express my obligations to my friend Egbert Eidgway 
for the kindness with which he has rendered me assistance in the prepa 
ration of these pages.

t Of the West Indian Islands inhabited by a species of Myadcutcs, but from which 
the National Museum possesses no specimens, are St. Domingo and Sta. Lucia. No 
species are known to occur upon the islands of Porto Rico, Guadeloupe, or Grenada, 
but as these islands are mountainous and resemble in other jihysical features those 
upon which species of Myadcstcs are kuown to occur, it is altogether probable that 
each one of these also possesses its peculiar sjiecies of the genus.

Average measurements of the above five specimens 



Hab.— St. Vincent. Mr. F. A. Ober states (Pr. U. S. Nat. Mus. 
1878, p. 188) that this bird "is an inhabitant of all the high ridges con- 
taining deep woods and ravines." He procured several specimens from 
the top of the volcan Souffricre (about 3,000' from the sea) and one 
from " High Woods, Sandy Bay, Carib Country." Lister met with it 
in every part of the high woods that he explored. 

Eemarks. — Strangely enough, the "Souff'riere Bird" is the most dis- 
tinct and remote species of the whole rufous-throated group, although 
the distance between St. Vincent aad Sta. Lucia is not greater than 
between Martinique and Dominica, not to mention the forms of St. 
Domingo and Jamaica, which, in spite of their remote habitat, are more 
nearly related to the Sta. Lucia bird than the St. Vincent species is. 
If. sihilans is easily distinguished by its proportionately shorter tail 
and longer tarsus, the normal second primary, the black color of the 
upper surface, and the white si>eculum on the wing. Besides, the 
rufous color on the under surface is mixed with orange, and totally 
different from the brownish tint of the other species.

largest. Tail considerably graduated and less emarginated, the middle 
pair being equal to the 2d pair from the outside ; tail-feathers a little 
shorter than wing. 

Upper surface pure slaty -plumbeons, forehead slightly washed with 
olivaceous; lores black; also a stripe below the white patch on the under 
eyelid, assuming the color of the back on the ear-coverts, each feather 
of which and the above-mentioned stripe having a narrow, well-defined 
white central streak behind, very faintly washed with brownish. From 
the base of lower mandible a well-defined malar stripe runs backwards, 
the anterior third of which is white, while the lower two-thirds have the 
color of the throat, from which the malar stripe is separated by a narrow, 
but distinct, black stripe, reaching close to the lower edge of the mandi- 
ble. Throat and chin chestnut-rufous, the white bases of the feathers 
on the latter showing somewhat through. Breast and upper sides of 
abdomen lighter than the back, almost clear ash-gray, becoming gradu- 
ally lighter towards the abdomen ; remaining underparts of the same 
color as the throat, only somewhat paler, and assuming a faint oliva- 
ceous shade on the upper abdomen ; tibia like the back, a few feath- 
ers being tipped with rufous. Wings blackish, with pale edges on 
the primaries and two ash-gray bars across the secondaries, leaving 
between them a deep black patch; wing-coverts, except the primary 
coverts, broadly edged with gray like the baclv ; innermost secondaries 
almost entirely so ; inner web of the quills white at the base, forming a 
broad bar on the under surface of the wing ; edge of wing grayish white. 
Middle tail-feathers uniform slate-gray ; the following pairs black, the 
three outmost with a wedge-shaped white spot on the inner web at the 
end, making on the innermost only one-fifth of the length of the quill, 
on the middle one about one-half, and on the outerinost about two-thirds, 
the outer webs being light slate-gray for the same extent from the tip. 
Bill black ; legs pale brownish yellow. 

The female seem to differ from the male in having the gray color of 
the breast less pure, this part being somewhat suffused with rufous-olive. 

A young bird in the collection of Mr. Geo. N. Lawrence {Martinique, 
July, 1877, F. A. Ober), which has begun to assume the adult plumage, 
has the underparts dull orange-rufous, each feather with blackish edges, 
except on the throat and under tail- coverts, which are almost unicolor; 
upper parts and small wing-coverts much darker, with small rufous 
spots before the black terminal edge; greater and middle wing-coverts 
edged at the tip with rufous. Wing-feathers elsewhere and tail almost 
identical with the same parts in the adults.

Hab. Martinique. The label ou No. 7ol3G states that the species 
is " abundant in high valleys." 

Remarks. — I have applied Swainson's name to this species with 
some hesitation, because Mr. P. L. Sclater (P. Z. S. 1871, p. 269) 
stares, that he has " compared the Santa Lucia skins of this bird with 
two examples of M. genibarhis in the Swainsonian collection at Cam- 
bridge (which, although not so marked, are in all probability typical 
specimens), and find them agree." On the other hand, the Martinique 
bird agrees much better with the figure and description of Swainson, 
which give the chin as having the same color as the throat. And as it 
is not quite clear from the statement of Mr. Sclater— who expressly 
mentions, that the St. Lucia skins do not agree with the said figure and 
description — to perceive, whether the birds in the Swainsonian collec- 
tion differ in the same manner, I have preferred to give the name in 
question to the form which best agrees with the plate and the descrip- 
tion, and to which Prof. S. F. Baird, in his admirable review (1. c.) 
already has applied the name. From Professor Baird's description it is 
evident that he has had before him specimens of this species, and that the 
determination of the locality, "Martinique," in the Lafresnaye collection 
was right. Besides, it is more probable that Swainson has had speci- 
mens from Martinique than from Sta. Lucia, since birds from the former 
island were common in collections, while it' is very doubtful whether 
any skins at all had been brought to Europe from the latter at the time 
when Swainson described his species.

3cT, 4tli, 5tli and Gtli longest. Tail as in M. geniharhis; tail-feathers 
eqnal to or a little longer than the wing. 

Whole upper parts slaty plumbeous with a conspicuous olivaceous 
wash, becoming more intense on the lower back, but lacking on the 
rump and upper tail-coverts. The pattern of the head that of M. (jeni- 
harhis, except that the black stripe below the eye extends further back 
on the auriculars, and that the white part of the malar stripe occupies 
the forward half. Chin pure white, this color abruptly defined against 
the throat, which is rufous-chestnut. The remaining underparts like 
those of the Martinique bird, except that the gray of the breast ex- 
tends more backward on the abdomen. Wings and tail also have 
the same general appearance as in the above-mentioned species; on the 
wings, however, the black speculum of the secondaries is more reduced, 
the adjacent grey cross-bands being broader, and on the tail the white 
is more extended, especially on the outer pair, in which the middle third 
of the outer web is white; besides, the outer webs of the three outermost 
rectrices are broadly tipped with white, and the following two jwirs 
have also very distinct white tips. Bill black, feet pale yellow. 

In none of the seven specimens before me is the sex indicated ; but 
as they show no differences from the specimen described above, I i^re- 
sume there is no difference between the male and female.

Hab. — Santa Lucia. Mr. Semper (1. c.) states these birds are " gen- 
erally found in the virgin forest or near it," and that " they are fond of 
cool shady places on the hills and high lauds." 

Eemarks. — Although very nearly allied to the foregoing species, the 
M. sanctce-luci(B is easily distinguishable by the well defined white chin, 
the greater amount of white in the malar stripe, the darker, more chest- 
nut shade of the rufous of the throat, the greater extent of the gray on 
the lower parts, and by the olivaceous tinge of the back in front of the 
rump. 

The differences from the next form, M. dominicanvs, will be pointed 
out under the head of the latter.

U. S. Nat. Mus. No. 77801. ( <? ad. Dominica. F. A. Ober.) 

Second primary two and oue-tliird times the 1st, which is acute and 
somewhat falcate ; 2d attenuated, but scarcely sinuated at end, inter- 
mediate in length between 7th and 8th; 3d equal to (5th, normal; 3d, 
4th, 5th, and 6th longest. Tail somewhat graduated,* the longest 
feathers equal to or a little shorter than the wing. 

Above slaty plumbeous, with a very faint tinge of olivaceous on head 
and back ; lores and a narrow stripe above the eyes conspicuously suf- 
fused with olivaceous ; almost the whole malar stripe whitish, the feathers 
the lower end tipped with chestnut; chin white, throat pure chestnut; 
breast, flanks, and abdomen, except the lower middle part of the latter, 
ash-gray, duller on the breast, more whitish on the abdomen, and very 
faintly washed with olivaceous, especially on the flanks, where more 
tinged with rufous ; lower middle of abdomen, crissum, and under tail- 
coverts chestnut-rufous ; wings and tail as in M. sanctcc-luvia', the light 
basal spot on the outer web of the innermost primaries being very con- 
spicuous and well defined ; the black speculum on the secondaries larger, 
and the amount of white on the outer tail feathers rather less than in 
that bird ; bill black, feet pale yellow. 

The 9 differs only in having a stronger wash of olive on the back, as 
Mr. Lawrence has already remarked {I. c). 

A young 9 in the first plumage, shot the 18th of September by Mr. 
Ober (U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 77803) resembles very much the young bird 
of M. (jeniharUs from Martinique, but may be easily distinguished by 
the deeper tinge of the rufous, by less well-defined edgings on the under 
surface, and by the rufous tips of the wing-coverts being larger and 
better defined, forming two very distinct bands across the wing. Be- 
sides, the tail shows the same differences as in the adults, the 4th and 
5th pair being tipped with white in the Dominica bird, while those 
feathers are uniform black in the typical M. gcnibarbis.

Hab. — Dominica. " Frequents the most gloomy and solitary mount- 
ain gorges. . . . Never found below 1,000 feet altitude." (Ober, 
P. IT. S. N, M., 1878, p. 53.) 

Remarks. — Compared with the two foregoing forms, the Dominica 
bird differs in having the throat of a much richer and deeper tint, being- 
beautiful chestnut without any mixture of rufous ; the rufous of the 
abdomen and crissum is still more restricted than in ill. santcclucia;, and 
is also of a deeper shade, agreeing with the color of the throat in the 
latter. It also differs from both in having almost the whole of the 
malar stripe whitish as described above. With the Santa Lucia bird 
it agrees in having the chin white, and the fourth and fifth pair (count- 
ing from outside) of the tail-feathers tipped with white, differing in both 
these respects from the typical M. geniharhis. 

In the tint of the throat the Martinique form is exactly intermediate 
between the other two, as might be expected on account of the inter- 
mediate position of this island between Sta. Lucia and Dominica; but 
it is a strange fact that the birds from these latter islands agree in other 
respects much better than either of them do with the bird from the 
island between them. 

The three forms here discussed are very closely allied, but as the 
differences mentioned above hold good through the extensive series of 
skins which I have been able to examine, I have not hesitated to describe 
them as separate forms. The singular relation between their mutual 
resemblances and the situation of the islands in which they occur, have 
convinced me that they, although originally grown out from the same 
parent stock, have how become distinct.

shade ; fourth and fifth pair without white tips. Bill black ; legs yellow ; 
claws a little more dusky.

Hab. — Haiti. — The only specimen which is yet known was procured 
by Mr. Charles B. Cory in the neighborhood of Fort Jacques, Haiti, 
He states {I. c.) that it is " an apparently rare species, frequenting the 
summits of the highest mountains." 

EemArks. — This species may be distinguished from the nearly related 
M. solitariits from Jamaica by the absence of the white spot on the 
extreme chin angle, and by having the malar spot rufous instead of 
white. The color of the throat is less chestnut, being considerably 
mixed with rufous ; the gray color of the breast and upper abdomen is 
much clearer and more mixed with rufous ; the rufous on the abdomen 
and crissum extends farther' forward on the former, and is much lighter 
than in the Jamaican bird. Besides, the species under consideration 
seems to be of smaller size. 

Although only the one specimen has been examined, I have very 
little doubt that the species will prove to be well founded. The in- 
dividual variation among these birds seems to be very limited, and 
the differences, pointed out above, are trenchant enough to make the 
two forms readily distinguishable.

The description of Yieillot (1. c.*) does not agree with any of the 
West-Indian Myadestes yet known. That it is not the genibarhis from 
Martinique is evident from the description, although Vieillot in 1818 
gives that island as the especial habitat of his bird. It may, however, 
be, that the description of the young bird, which he gives for the first 
time in E". Diet. d'Hist. Nat. xxi, p. 418 (1818), belongs to the Marti- 
nique species, and hence the statement of the habitat. Mr. Sclater 
(1. c.) thinks "It is possible that M. armillatus verus may be the spe- 
cies from St. Domingo," but the bird detected in that island by Mr. 
Cory agrees less with Yieillot's description than any of the other

known forms, and in view of the peculiarity in their geographical dis- 
tribution, that each of the mountainous islands has its own distinct 
species, it seems very improbable that another form is still to be found 
in St. Domingo. The most perplexing features of Vieillot's bird are 
the brown feet and the beautiful yellow bracelet on the lower part of 
the tibia, and I am inclined to indorse the view of Mr. Robert Eidg- 
WAY, that it is one of the known species,* poorly described, from a 
specimen supplied with legs and feet belonging to a quite different bird. 
The strong scutellation of the tarsus, as shown in the plate, seems to 
indicate that this suspicion is well founded. On the other hand, it 
should not be overlooked that M. sibilans has the tibiiP colored some- 
what like the bird in question, and that the West-Indian islands are not 
yet so satisfactorily explored that anything can be said with certainty. 

I therefore here reprint Professor Baird's translation (1. c.) of Vieil- 
lot's description of the adult : 

" Bill blackish ; a white spot on the sides of the throat, and at its 
origin (the chin) immediately below the lower mandible (the two con- 
tinuous) ; the eye surrounded by the same color. Head, back, rump, 
two intermediate tail-feathers, and the breast of a grayish-slate, paler 
below. Wing and tail feathers blackish, bordered externally by gray, 
the three lateral on each side of the tail more or less white. Belly and 
hinder parts brownish rufous ; a beautiful yellow in form of a bracelet 
on the feathers of lower part of leg ; feet brown ; length, G inches, 3 
lines." ViEiLLOT, Ois. Am. Sept. I, 69.

ON s^omc: geiveric aiv» specific appei^IjAtioivs of north 

AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN BIRDS. 

By tEONHARD STEJNEGER. 

Looking at the ornitliological nomenclature and the changes which it 
daily undergoes, in consequence of the radical introduction of the oldest 
generic or sjiecilic appellations, without considering that many com- 
monly adopted names thus become expelled, we feel it to be our duty to 
make this transitional state as short as possible, by presenting the evi- 
dences we may possess, and by proposing those changes Avhich appear 
necessary. 

The following remarks are chiefly proposed in reference to the names 
of North American and European birds, as they are given in the latest 
catalogues of birds from those regions, viz : Eobeiit Kidgway's "Xo- 
menclature of North American Birds" (Washington, 1881), and H. E. 
Dresser's "List of European Birds" (London, 1881). 

As to the rules of the nomenclature, it seems to me that the 
best are those which present the smallest number of exceptions, and 
which, once adopted, give the least occasion for disputes. I therefore 
propose to nse the oldest available name in every case, where it can be 
proved, and to spell it exactly as it was spelled when published for the 
first time, notwithstanding incorrect derivation, barbarous offspring, 
error facti, &c. 

The significance of a name, by means of the sound and the appearance, 
is to give a conception of the named object as being different from 
all other objects. If it, at the same time, can be formed so that it indi- 
cates one or another chief property of the object, then it is the better. 
The main j)oint is, however, that we, by hearing or seeing the name, will 
get an idea of the object as being different from any other. 

That names which do not signify anything cause no inconvenience 
worth mentioning is evident from the numberless specific names, indi- 
cating a quality common to all the species within the same genus, e. (/. 
cinereus,fuseus, etc. It may be rather tedious that the names are incor- 
rect, but the simply endless number of incorrect names with which we 
daily work, without feeling especially troubled, and which probably no 
one intends to change or to correct, shows better than anything else 
how unimportant the corrections and improvements are for fticilitatiug 
the work. I think that we may very soon agree that many corrections 
have caused more trouble than relief, as for instance such improvements 
as Heniconetta for Eniconetta,, and the like, and that they only have suc- 
ceeded in swelling our lists of synonyms. 

The only rule which can be carried out with safety, is the use of the 
oldest name, without regard to its apj)earance, derivation, or significa- 
tion. If this be adopted, most differences would disappear from the 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIOKAL MUSEUM. 29 

iiouieuclature, and it is in fact the only rule which is able to establish a 
passable uniformity in place of the present variety. Once universally 
accepted and put in practice, it would save much time, labor, and dis- 
pute ; disputes concerning year and date may easily be settled, while 
all philological and linguistic disagreements may be thereby avoided. 
The question as to which species one or another name is to be referred 
has nothing to do with the rules of nomenclature, and are therefore 
liable to come up at any time. 

As to the following remarks, it will be seen that some of the pages 
quoted are given in brackets. This signifies that the author has not had 
opportunity of verifying them, and that he therefore does not answer 
for their correctness. All the other citations have been carefully gone 
over, and are thouglit to be quite correct. He has followed this method 
in his later papers, and intends to proceed so in all his works in the 
future. 

In order to show how far carelessness in quotation and excessive zeal 
concerning philological correctness may bring it, I select from the syno- 
nymy of Phoenicurus titys, p. 30, the following bouquet: tifys, tithys, 
thytis, tythis, titJds, thitis, tites, tcthys ; and many other modes of spelling 
this word are surely to be found by a scrupulous investigation through 
the whole literature. Now please, dear reader, if you are as learned a 
philologist as an ornithologist, choose the right one!

As it is not preoccupied, there is no reason for rejecting it. Vieillot, 
indeed, states that his bird is identical with the European species, which, 
he erroneously calls Motacilla reguhis Lin., but he gives a description 
and plate, which represent the American bird better than the Regulus 
ignicapillm Brm. The following is thought to be a tolerably exhaustive 
synonymy of these species :

HIRUNDO, CHELIDON, and COTILE. 

It has almost nnanimously been considered, tliat Bote (Isis, 1822), 
was the first who subdivided the genus Hirundo after the species be- 
longing to Cypselus had been removed, and consequently his names 
Hirundo (type riistica LiN.), GlieUdon (type urhicaljUi.)., and CoUle (type 
riparia Lin.) have been generally adopted. The same species, how- 
ever, had already five years earlier been made types of three different 
genera, by Thomas Forster, who, in his " Synoptical Catalogue of 
British Birds" (London, 1817), establishes the genera Chelidon, Hirundo 
and Clivicola, having as tyi^es respectively rustica, urhica, and riparia. 

These names, which are as well founded as the later names of BoiE, 
cannot, so fiir as I can see, be rejected. Mr. Forster himself states, 
p. 40, that he has " in the following catalogue attended to generic and 
specific differences, and thereon founded a nomenclature, regardless of 
the modern names, wherever they appeared to disagree with facts." • 

I suppose the following will stand as the correct synonymy : 

CheUdon Forster, 1817.

Lin.). 
=1822.— Hirundo Boie, Isis, 1822, p. 550 (nee Forster, 1817), (same type). 

Of this genus we only have one species in North America, viz : 
1. CheUdon erythrogastra (BoDD.), Barn Swallow. 
The European species are : 
CheUdon rustica (Lin.), and 
CheUdon savignii (Steph.).

PLECTROPHANES and CENTEOPHANES. 

In his " Ornithologisches Taschenbuch von uud fiir Dentschland oder 
kurze Beschreibung aller Vogel Deutschlands " (Leipzic, 1803), Bech- 
STEIN separates the FHngilla lapponica from the other Fringillie, and 
gives to this group, which he characterizes "by having an acute pointed 
bill with considerably i" fccted tomia, and a long straight claw on the 
hind toe ", the name Calcarius. This is, as far as I know, not preoccu- 
pied, and must therefore necessarily stand as the name for the genus, 
which has F. lapponica for its type. The Snow Bunting he left in the 
genus Fmheriza. In 1815 Dr. Bernhard Meyee, in his '' Kurze Be- 
schreibuug der Vogel Liv- und Esthlands " created the genus Plectro- 
plumes for the same type in the following words : " Fringilla calcarata 
Fall, (this bird does not at all belong to the genus Fringilla, but forms a 
separate genus, which I call Plectrophanes, Longspur)." He also did not 
include the Snow Bunting in this genus, but treated it under the head of 
Fmberiza, following the example of BECiiSTEiN.t In the third volume 
of the "Taschenbuch" (1822) Mr. Meyer first unites the two species 
under the same genus, FlectropJianes. In 1829 Jakob Katjp, in his 
'< Skizzirte Entwickelungo-Geschichte und Natiirliches System der 
Europiiischen Thierwelt," again separates the two species, selecting 

* Forster uses this name a few pages earlier tlian Clivicola. As, however, the 
adoption of Biparia would necessitate the change of the specific name of H. riparia 
into europa'a FORST. 1817 (which would be inconvenient, because the species is by no 
means limited to Europe), or into cinerca Vieill. 1817 (which has only been used for 
the supposed American form), I have i^referred to accept the name Clivicola. 

i Mr. Dresser in his " Birds of Europe " erroneously cites Plectrophanes lapponica 
Mey. & Wolf, Tasch. Vog. Deutschl. I (1810), p. 187, and P. nivalis Mey. & Wolf, op. 
cit. p. 176 ; but these authors 1. c. only give the names Fringilla calcarata and Emheriza 
nivalis, and the word Plectroplianes is not to be found either in the first or the second 
volume of their work. Consequently, the statement of Temminck, Man. d'Orn. 2 ed. 
I (1820), p. 318, is also false, viz, that " Mr. Meyer has made of this species \_E. nivalis'] 
and of the following IE. calcarata} the genus Plectrophanes."

each as type for different genera, nivalis for PlectrojJhanes and lapponiea 
for Centroplianes^ and liereiu he has been followed by later writers. 
But from the foregoing statement it is evident that — 

(1) Beciistein's Calcarius is the oldest name ; 

(2) the type of this is Fr. lapponiea Lin. ; 

(3) Meyer's Plectrophanes is merely a synonym of Calcarius, having 
the same type ; 

(4) the same is the case with Kaup's Centropkanes ; 

(5) his Plectrophanes cannot be used for the genus having E. nivalis 
for ty^ie, because preoccupied as synonymous with Calcarius ; 

(6) the genus which has E. nivalis for its type should be su])plied with 
a new name, as no later name has been given. In order to make as 
little change as possible, I propose for it the name Plcctrophenax* 

The synonymy of the two genera is then the following :

ARCHIBUTEO LAGOPUS (Brunn.), 1704. 

Authors who reject names given before 176G, usually cite ArcMbuteo 
lagopus (Gm.), 1788. As Gunnerus, in 1767, has described the species 
very distinctly in Leex's Finm. Beskr.* p. 237, as Falco norvegicus, they 
will have to adopt the name Archibuteo norvegicus (Gunn.), 1767, 
being the first name applied to the bird after the 12th edition of Linn^i 
Syst. Nat., in which the species is not included. The description of 
Gunnerus is as follows : 

"Falconis hujus * * * pullum vivum * * * accepi in nido 
captum, jam 8 menses natum : maguitudo est gallinadei. In dorso, alis 
et subtus fuscu* est, maculis canis sublematis supra, i^rnesertim in alis

cicoxiA Alba. 

The oldest author for this name has been stated to be Bechstein, in 
liis [Nalurgesch. Vtig. Deutschl. Ill (1793), p. 48. It is, however, ante- 
dated by ScHAFFER, who in 1789, Mus. Orn., p. 52, gave the name Cico- 
.nia alba. 

STEEPSILAS ILLIG. 1811, 

is untenable, being one year younger than Morinella Mey. & Wolf, 
Taschb. Viig. Deutschl. II, p. 383 (1810). 
The two North-American species are :

is antedated by Scolopax media Bock, Naturforscher, XIII (1779), p. 211, 
which belongs to the bird subsequently called Scolopax major by Gmelin 
iu 1788, and must therefore give place to Gallinago coelestis FREUZEL.t 
The North-American form will then stand as 

Gallinago coelestis wilsoni (Temm.).— Wilson's Snipe. 

TOTANUS GLOTTIS (Lm.) Bechst. 

is the name usually adopted for the Greenshank, and for this is 
quoted either Syst. Nat. ed. 10, i, p. 116 (1758), Fauna Svec, ed. 2, p. 
61 (1761), or Syst. Nat., ed. 12, i, p. 245 (1766). Auy one who will take 
the trouble to compare these three quotations will soon find that they 
refer to a bird totally different from the Totanus glottis of Bechst. The 
fact that the three descriptions of Linnaeus do not fully agree, will be 
mentioned later; for the present we will only consi<ler those characters 
which occur in all the three editions, or which occur only in the one 
without being contradictory to any character given in the others. 

The following phrase of the diagnosis is the same iu all the editions: 
^^Rostro recto hasi inferiori ruhro^'; and the same phrase is repeated in 
the description in the Fauna, thus: ''Rostrum nigrumhasi infer ioris mat- 
ilia rnhra:^ Bechstein's glottis has the bill "gray at the base" (un- 
der Wurzel gran), and never red or reddish at auy age or season. 

After the diagnosis follows a reprint of the diagnosis of the first 
edition of the Fauna, ^4z, "i^emi^i&ws Uneis albis piscisque undidatis:^ 
In Bechstein's glottis the primaries, however, are black, and the 

* (Cf. R. COLLETT, in Chiistiania Vicleusk. Forh. 1881, No. 10, p. 4.— R. R.)

um Wittenberg. 1801. (p. 58). 



36 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

secomlaries grayish, with wliite edges. In the 12th edit, is said : ^^Alha 
immaculata sunt . . . tectrices alarum^^^ while tliose (upper wiiig- 
coverts) in the summer plumage of glottis Bechst. are dark grayish- 
brown with a black stripe along the shafts, in the autumnal plumage 
brownish-gray with such a stripe, and in the young blackish-brown with 
rusty-gray edges. Further in the same edition Linnaeus says : '■^Remujes 
primores scapo albo^^ ; in the glottis Bechst. only the shaft of the first 
quill is white, while the shafts of the remaining primaries are black. 
From these quotations it is evident that the glottis of Linnaeus is a bird 
totally different from the species so named by Bechstein, while most 
authors since Bechstein's time, however, mean the bird of the latter 
when they are speaking about Totanns glottis (Lin.). 

It remains to determine to which species the desciiptions of Linn^us 
really belong. In order to clear up this question it will be necessary to 
compare those characters which in the above-mentioned three editions 
do uot agree. It will thus be seen that while in the diagnoses the legs 
are said to be greenish ['■'' pedihus vircscentibus''^), they are given as plum- 
beous {'■'' pedeo plumhei'''') in the description of the Fauna. In the same 
work is said: ^'■pectus griseum,^^ hut in the 12th edition, ^'^ Alba imma- 
culata sunt pectus. . . ." From these disagreements of the descriptions 
it seeiis to be very probable that Linn^us in this case did not give his 
diagnosis and descriptions from the specimens themselves, but ouly from 
the statements of earlier Avriters. The phrase '^ i)edes plumbci'^ may 
thus have been taken from Strom, who, in his Siindmors Beskrivelse, I, 
p. 235, quotes the Linnaean diagnosis in the following manner : " Nu- 
menius pedibus virescentihus (more correctly plumbei). . . ." This 
opinion seems also to be well founded when one comj)ares the very 
meager description of the Fauna (L c.) with the ranch fuller descriiJtious 
of other species, of which Linn^us had specimens before him when 
describing. It will therefore be very useful to know which species the 
authors cited by LtnnyEUS may have meant. In the 12th edit. Linn.eus 
quotes as synonymous Limosa grisea major Briss., ed. 5, p. 272, t. 24, f. 
2. To this species Brisson himself cites the same authors, which are 
given by Linnaeus, and besides, the diagnosis of Linn^i Systema, 10th 
edit., and Fauna, 1st ed. From the excellent description of Brisson it is 
unquestionable that his species is Limosa lapponica in winter-])himage. 
The description of Strom (1. c.) also shows that the bird in question 
belongs to this species. It then only remains to determine whether the 
characters given by Linn^us agree with those of L. lapponica. This 
species has in fact the base of the lower mandible reddish, as described 
above, and also the shafts of the first quills white. The two other marks, 
"quills varied with white and black lines," and "wing-coverts white, 
unspotted," do uot agree so well, but the diflerence is not great, and is 
easily understood when one attends to the manner in which the descrij)- 
tion has been made ; the inner webs of the first quills are variegated as 
above described, and although the wing-coverts are not unspotted 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 37 

wliite, this color, however, occapies a larger space on the wing-coverts 
of this species than in any other which h'^.re reasonably can he in ques- 
tion. The other characters agree as well with both species, and conse- 
quently they speak in favor of the opinion here expressed. 

Having thus proved that the Scolopax glottis Linnaeus is merely a 
synonym of Limosa lapponica, we proceed to select a new name for it, 
the first binominal one given to the bird in question, the Green-shank. 

In 1767 Knud .Lekm published his " Beskrivelse over Finmarkens 
Lapper," with a Latin translation following the Danish text, in which 
work the Norwegian bishop Gunnerus, a very distinguished and, at 
that time, everywhere in Europe, highly esteemed naturalist, and one 
of the more prominent of the pupils of Linnaeus, gives a tolerably 
complete account of the natural history of northern Xorway in form of 
foot-notes. In these we find many good descriptions, and several species 
named for the first time, and there is not the slightest reason for reject- 
ing his names, as he was a strict binominalist, whose descriptions are 
very clear, and published in a proper manner after 1706. 

As tbe work is perhaps somewhat scarce, I think it proper to give 
its title in full below.* 

From his diagnosis of Scolopax nehularia (p. 251), ^^Rostro levi, acuto, 
sub-reeurvato^ collo pectoraque albido, macidis fuscis ; rachi prima remiqis 
nivea " it is beyond doubt that he means the species here in question. 
The description of the bill is sufficient to separate this bird from the 
other species of Totanus Beciist., which have the beak straight, and it 
cannot be confounded with any Limosa., having the shaft of the first 
quill white. The comparison with other species which he gives corrobo- 
rates this opinion, as also does his quotation of Strom's Sondm. Beskr. 
I, p. 252. 

As Gmelin's name canescens was bestowed 21 years later, and his 
description is by far not so precise as that of Gunnerus, the name of the 
latter must be adopted, and the species for the future stand as Totanus 
nehularius (Gunn.). 

The synonymy may be given as follows :

PAGOPHILA EBURXEA (Phipps). 

As to this bird, both the generic and the specific appellations are to 
be changed. PagopMla is antedated by Gavia Boie, 1822, to whom tlie 
first use of this name, as a generic one, is to be referred. Moiiring, 
it is true, had already used the same word in another sense, but as his 
genera are not recognized there cannot be any obstacles for adopting 
them by later authors. Kaup's name PagopMla is 7 years younger and 
based iiijon the same type as Boie's genus. 

Synonymy of the genus : 

Gavia-BoiE 1822,

The Ivory Gull had already, in 1707, received a binominal appellation 
by GuNNERUS, who applied to it the name Lams albns in the following 
words : " Larus albus .... qui toto interdum corpore albus esse 
& Laro cano vel & fusco magnitiidine convenire perhibetur .... 
Ni valde fallor, Larus hie habendus est idem ac Senator Martensii, qui 
toto corpore albus, nostro & pedibus uigris describitur esse." The 
restoration of this name, which is 7 years older tlian the eburneus of 
Piiipps, cannot meet with any ol*jection, as the later use of the same 
]iame by Scopoli and Stat. Muller never has been adopted.

LARUS GLAUCUS (Brunn.). 

The appellation of this species exhibits a close analogy to the facts 
referred to under Archibuteo lagopus (Brunn.), and writers, who choose 
the 12th edit, of Linn^ei Systema as the starting point for specific 
names, will have no alternative but to adopt the name of Gunnerus, 
given in 1707, as the bird has not recei\ed any name by Linn^us. 
There can be no doubt as to which species the following descri])tion of 
Gunnerus belongs : " Larus hyperborens dorso dilute ciuereo, extremi- 
tatibus remigum albis. A Martensio in itril. Spitzberg. dicitur Ger- 
manice Burgemeister. A Brilnn. in Ornith. p. 14, n. 14S evocatur Larus

Gunnerus in Leem's Beskr. Finm. Lapp. p. 283 (1707).

HYDROCHELIDOIir LARIFORMIS (Lin.). 

I see no reason whatever for rejecting the name Sterna nigra for this 
species, because there can be no doubt about which species Linn^us 
has described under this name. That Gray and others have used the 
names Jissrpes for this species, and erroneously given the appeUation 
nigra to another, cannot be a hiuderance to the restoring of the proper 
name. The Ibllowing citations from Linnet's descriiitiou in Fauna 
Snec, 2d ed. p. 50, will be sufficient to show that he means the common 
black Tern: ^^ Color iotius avis supra canus''^ and ^'■remiges d' rectricbs 
omnes unicolores & subtus alhescentes.'''' From these it is evident that the 
rump and upper surface of the tail are gray, which are the very charac- 
teristic features of the bird occurring in Scandinavia, in opposition to 
leucopfera Meisn., which has the rump and the upper surface of the tail 
white, being one of the rarest stragglers in the country of Linn^us. 
His statement '■'■Hahitat Ultunw prope Upsaliam''^ therefore corroborates 
the opinion here expressed. 

The synonjauy of the European form is the following:

STERCORAEIUS CEEPIDATUS and PARASITICUS. 

Since the first separation of the two species, which are called "Rich- 
ardson's Jaeger" and " Long-tailed Jaeger,'' much dispute among authors 
has arisen from the question, to which of these ^i)ec\GS the piarasiticus of 
LiNN^us really belongs.* At one time the (me opinion has been the 
])revailing one, and at other times the opposite belief. For a long time 
the "Richardson's Jaeger" held the name in unquestioned possession.

name parasiticus to Richardson's "Jaeger;" see Leem, Beskr. Finm. Lapp. pp. 239 
and 287) confound the two species. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 41 

until in the later years especially English ornithologists (Saunders, 
Dresser) have tried to vindicate the name ]}arasiticus for the long- 
tailed species. 

In the 10th edition of Linn^ei Systema we find nothing which justifies 
the change of the generally adopted appellation. Mr, Saunders (Pr. 
Zool. Soc. Lond. 187G, p. 327) thinks, however, that the short diagnosis, 
viz, '■'■ rectricihus duabus intennedus longissimis,^^ is snflBcient to prove 
the contrary, and exclaims, "Nothing could well be clearer!" This 
might perhaps have been right, if Linn^us had had before him more 
than one species, of which one or more were supplied with rectricihus 
longiSj and the parasiticus then was given as having rectrices longissimi ; 
but as he knew but one species, his expression would be quite correct 
if the middle pair of rectrices in his parasiticus had been still shorter 
than they are in " Kichardson's Jaeger." The phrase "i^ec^rices iuter- 
medii longissimi" indicates only that the middle pair was longer than 
the other, or it may also siguify that it in this "iar?(s" was very long 
compared with the other Lari described by him, which all had a square 
tail. Mr. Sundevall (Tent. Meth. Av. Disp. p. 130) uses the same 
phrase exactly in the same meaning, when he characterizes the whole 
genus in the words, " Cauda suhaquali, pennis 2 mediis lougissimis," and 
nobody will cousider this to be incorrect, although he, in the genus thus 
cliaracterized, includes the Cataracta sJcua Brunn. Besides, the quo- 
tations and the habits of the bird, as they are given in the lOtli edition, 
agree better with the common Jaeger than with the long-tailed species. 
The authors who take this edition for their starting point in nomencla- 
ture have not the slightest reason for changing the name. 

Saunders, Dresser, and most English writers, however, found 
their nomenclature on the 12th edition of 1766. In this the diagnosis 
from the 10th edition is reprinted verbatim. Besides, there is nothing 
new which can justify the change ; it might then be that Linn^us here 
cites as synonymous the longicaudatus of Brisson, but as he does not 
adopt the other sj^ecies of the same author, the " Stercorrarius^^^ the erro- 
neous citation is of no importance, as it only shows that he did not 
recognize more than one species. Thus the 12th edition does not furnish 
any reason supporting the change. But — and this is the main point — 
this edition contains a phrase which corroborates the opinion here de- 
feuded, and which appears to have been overlooked by Mr. Saunders, 
viz, '■^ Rachis remigum rectricumque, imprimis subtus, nivea." From this 
quotation it seems to be evident that Linn^us means the biM which 
has the shafts of all the primaries white, and that his parasiticus of 1766 
belongs less to the long-tailed species than even the parasiticus of 1758. 
If it is so that both editions of the Systema jSTaturalis entitle the common 
Jaeger to bear the name parasiticus Lin., it will be of no importance 
that the description in Fauna Svecica (1761) — the diagnosis is the same 
as in S. K. — is perhaps made from a specimen of the long-tailed species 
which Linnaeus himself confounded with the common Jaeger. It will

have uo iuflueiice on those authors who start from 1758, because the 
description of the Fauna is of later date, and it ujust have less influence 
on those who date their specific appellations from 1700, because the said 
description is older, and those ornithologists pay no attention to names 
given before that date. It will be the less justifiable for them to use 
the name of 1701, as this is opposite to the appellation of 1700. 

Mr. Saunders himself states (torn. cit. p. 051) that " these violent 
transfers must always be productive of confusion even when justifiable." 
Where the case is clear and allows no doubt, we will have, however, to 
accept the oldest name, even if the restoration for a short time would 
produce sojne confusion, but it should never be performed where the 
case is doubtful, or, like the present, more than doubtful. 

In order to show the proper names of the two species, I give the fol-

PODICEPS and COLYMBUS. 

LiNNvEUS united the Grebes and the Loons or Divers in the same 
genus, Colymhus, but in 1700 Beisson had already separated the Loons 
from the Grebes, retaining the name Colymbus for the latter. In 1777 
ScopoLi followed his example. Ten years later Latham applied the 
name Podiceps to the same group, this consequently being a mere 
synomym of Colymbus as restricted by Brisson. As the name given 
by the latter author to the Loons was preoccupied, the next name, which 
is Cuviek's Urinator, is to be used. The name Eudytes Illiger, 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 43 

altliough 12 years younger, has been generally adopted, but it must 
give way to the older name, for the suppression of which I see no 
reason. 

The following is the synonymy of the genus :

All the species belonging to this genus occur in North America, viz : 

1. Urinator immer (Beunn.), 

usually known among North American ornithologists as C. torquatus 
BRtJNN.; but as the former name also is ncceptable to those writers who 
follow the Stricklaudfan code of nomenclature, and who reject specific 
names older than 17GG, I have found the name C. immer preferable, 
liecause it also occurs in the 12th edition of Linn^i Syst. Nat. 
The synonymy of the species is given as follows : 

1764. — Coljimbus immer Brvsn., Ornith. Bor. p. 38.

4. Urhiator iMcificus (Lawr.).

This is the G. septentrionalis Lin. 1706. But as Linn^i^us does m)t 
give the name either in the 10th edition o.f Syst. Nat. or in 2d ed. of 
Fauna Svecica (17G1), the name of BRiJNNiCH is to be used.

In treating of the genus Harporhi/nchus, in its comprehensive sense, 
most authors have alluded more or less strongly to the great difference 
in ibrm presented by the type of the genus [H. rediviviai) on the one 
hand and certain species associated with it under the same generic name 



44 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

(notably "5." rufns). The various attempts at subdivision, however, 
have either proven faihires, ou account of the gradual transition between 
the two extremes in certain characters, or unsatisfactory, by reason of 
the line having been varionsly drawn by different authors.* As long 
ago as 185S, however, the line separating Methrioptents from Harpor- 
hijmhus appears to have been properly drawn, by Professor Baird in a 
"Synopsis of the species" under the heading of the latter, on p. 348 of 
" Birds of Xorth America." While, however, arranging the species in a 
table under the two separate headings {Harporhymhus including redivi- 
vus, lecontei, and crissalis, Methriopterm comprising curvirostris, longiros- 
tris, and riifus), Professor Baird hesitated to separate the two.groups gen- 
erically,but remarked as follows concerning the matter: " The transition 
from the one extreme in structuce in H. redivivus to the other in T. rufus 
is so gradual as to render it very difficult to separate them ; T. curviros- 
tris has a shorter tarsus (about equal to the middle toe) than the others, 
and the graduation of the tail is less. It is very difficult to say whether 
it should more properly be assigned to the first section or the second. 
In the character of the bill there is the most gradual transition from its 
very long greatly curved shape in H. redivivus to the straight and short 
one of H. rufusJ^ It appears, however, that other characters of more 
importance than the mere size and shape of the bill, serve, when taken 
in connection with the latter, to very readily distinguish two groups 
which it seems to me are of generic rank. These distinctions I have 
been able to verify in the case of all the species known to date, includ- 
ing two {M. palmeri and ill. hendirei unknown when Professor Baird's 
"Keview" was published, besides two others M. cinereus (Xantus), and 
ilf. ocellatus (Scl.) not taken into consideration in the "Birds of North 
America." These characters are as follows : 

1. Harporhynchus. Tarsus much shorter than culmen ; gonys 
equal to or longer than middle toe, without claw; tail exceeding the 
wing by much more than the length of the tarsus. Lower parts wholly 
immaculate. 

2. Methriopterus. Tarsus longer than the culmen ; gonys much 
shorter than the middle toe, without claw; tail exceeding the wing by 
much less than the length of the tarsus. Lower parts more or less dis- 
tinctly spotted or streaked (jnarkings nearly obsolete in .1/. palmeri). 

To Harporliynclius, as thus restricted, belong only E. redivivus, H. 
leeontei, and //. crissalis, while to Methriopterus may be referred the

same arrangement, Harporhynchus being represented by "jff." curvirostris, and Methri- 
opterus by "^." louffirostris, "H." rufus, and "H." cinereus. It is iiropcr to state, 
however, that the term Methriopterus is not used in a generic sense, but merely as a 
convenient subgeneric heading.

following: M. riifus, M. longirostris, M. ocellatus, M. cinereus^ M. hoidirei, 
M. palmeri, aud M. curvirostris. This arrangemeut, I am aware, removes 
M. palmeri much further from R. lecontei thau Mr. Brewster (ef. Bull. 
Nutt. Orn. Olub, vi, Apr. 1881, p. 67) has suggested should be its posi- 
tion, but after a very careful comparison with all the species, made in 
coTiuection with Mr. Brewster's remarks upon the subject, 1 am con- 
vinced that the two birds have in fact nothing in common beyond a 
general superficial resemblance in coloration. In fact, these two si)e- 
cies, wbich exhibit the nearest approach in the two genera, may be 
as readily distinguished by the characters given above as may H. redi- 
vivus and R. rnfus, although the difference is of course far greater be- 
tween the two latter. With but a single specimen of R. lecontei for 
comparison, I cannot verify a single one of the characters adduced by 
Mr. Brewster as distinguishing this species from R. redirlvus, although 
I am obliged to indorse his view of their specific distinctness, since 
very positive specific characters distinguish them, the most important 
of which, it appears to me, are the following : 

1. H. REDivivus. Tail slightly darker and somewhat browner than 
the back ; lower parts chiefly ochraceous-buff", the crissum more fulvous; 
auriculars dusky, with distinct whitish shaft-streaks; no distinct dusky 
"bridle'' or paler malar stripe. Wing 3.90-4.30, tail 4.90-5.80, culmen 
(to exposed base) 1.35-1.75; width of maxilla at nostrils .25-.30, the 
lafeml outlines gradually hut decidedly divergent totcard the hase; tarsus 
1.45-l.GO, middle toe .95-1.12. 

2. H. LECONTEI. Tail very decidedly darker but scarcely browner 
than the back; lower parts (especially abdomen) chiefly dull white, the 
crissum ochraceous, in marked contrast ; auriculars light brownish gray, 
like occiput, without distinct paler streaks; throat bordered on each 
side by a distinct dusky "bridle," and a distinct malar stripe of whitish, 
imrrowly barred with dusky. Wing 3.70-3.90, tail 4.57-5.20, culmen 
(from exposed base) 1.25-1.35; width o/ maxilla at nostrils .20-21, the 
lateral outlines parallel from near the tip hacJc nearly or quite to nostrils; 
tarsus 1.25, middle toe .S5. 

It will thus be seen that aside from positive characters afforded by 
the plumage, the proportions of the two species are radically distinct. 
While the wing and tail average slightly less in R. lecontei, the tarsus 
aud middle toe are disproportionately shorter. In fact, both the feet 
and bill are altogether slenderer, and much more like those of iT^. crissa- 
lis, to which there is also a nuich nearer resemblance in the dusky 
"bridle" and whitish malar stripe. 

The ^' Rarporhynchus^'' graysoni, from the island of Socorro, I propose 
to make the typQ of a new geiuis, as follows: 

Genus MIMODES, Eidgway. 

Ch. — Somewhat like Mimus, but with the bill decidedly stouter 
the wing much more rounded, and the colors much more uniform. 



46 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Tail much longer tlian the wing, rounded, but with the four middle 
rectrices of equal length. Fourth, fifth, and sixth quills longest, the 
third about equal to the seventh; second not longer than the tenth. 
Depth of the bill through the base decidedly more than half the length 
of the gonys, or of the maxilla from the nostril to the tip ; gonys less 
than half the total length of the mandible. Colors plain brown, paler 
below, without distinct white markings on wings or tail. 

Type, Harporhynchus graysoni Baird. 

In general appearance, the type and only known species of this genus 
is somewhat intermediate between the species of the genera Metliriop- 
terus and HarporhyncJmi^, having the straighter bill of the former and the 
uniform brownish coloration of the latter. A close comparison, how- 
ever, reveals the fact that the species in question is very much more 
nearly related to the genus Mimus than to either of those named above^ 
while at the same time it becomes obvious that it cannot be included in 
the latter genus, by reason of the very marked distinctive characters 
pointed out above, in which it dilfers from every species of Mini us with 
which I have been able to compare it.* The distinctive characters of 
the two genera may be contrasted as follows : 

Mimus. Depth of bill through base decidedly less than half the length 
of the maxilla from nostril to tip, and not more than half the length of 
the gonys; the latter decidedly more than the distance from its base to 
the malar apex; third, fourth, and fifth quills longest, second longer, 
equal to or longer than eighth. Tail with more or less of white. 

MiMODES. Depth of bill through base decidedly more than half the 
length of the maxilla from nostril to tip, and also decidedly more than 
half the length of the gonys; the latter decidedly less than the distance 
from its base to the malar apex. Fourth, fifth, and sixth quills longest, 
the second equal to the tenth. Tail without white. 



0.\ A PlIOJSiPHATIC SANDSTONE FROITI HAWTHORNE, IN FLORIDA. 

Bj^GEORGE \%. HALVES, PH. D., 

Curator in the Natioiud Museum. 

In connection with the work, upon the products of quarries which is 
being performed under the auspices of the Tenth Census at the National 
Museum in Washington, analyses have been made of a stone that is 

*Iiichicling the following: M. polyglottus (including its West Indian races), M. 
triurus, M. f/ilvus, M. satiirninns, M. calandria, M. thenca, M. longicaudatns, M. "nigriloris," 
M. MUi, and M. vielanotls. I have not seen specimens of M. dorsalis, M. patachonicus, 
M. Mfasciatiis, or M. parvulua, but these species (except possibly the two latter) api>ear 
to be congeneric with those named above. It may prove advisable, however, to 
separate the three species of the Galapagoes (M. melanotis, M. trifasciatus, and M. 
paniulus) on account of their very lengthened and slender bill, but I am not prepared 
to say that this should be done.

quarried iu Florida, wliicli bas proved to contain ingredients that make 
it valuable for other than building purposes. To render this informa- 
tion available to those interested in agricultural resources, the analyses 
that have been made upon this material are now published. 

There are very few stone quarries iu the State of Florida — in fact 
almost the only one in actual operation is that at Hawthorne, in Alachua 
County, which is operated by Mr. C. A. Simmons. 

When saturated with its quarry water this stone is quite soft and can 
be cut with an axe or sawn with much facility, and bricks of any desired 
shape can be very easily cut from it. The chimneys of the region, and 
the walls and houses, so far as stone has been used in their construction, 
are made from blocks that have been taken from this quarry. The ma- 
terial rapidly hardens when exposed to the air and sun, and some struct- 
ures that were made of it thirty years ago are said to be still in good 
conditiou. Cubes 34 inches upon their edges have been extracted, and 
it is stated that a cube two or three times as large might be obtained. 
The cubic contents of the excavated space is 800 yards, but the space 
occupied by the deposit covers a large area and the material is said 
to be practically inexhaustible. The marl beds which are associated 
with this rock coutain sharks' teelh and bones which mark the Tertiary 
age of the formation. Professor Smith, who has so recently written upon 
the geology of Florida, in the American Journal of Science, April, 1881, 
page 292, states that this bed belongs with the Yicksburg beds which 
cover so large a portion of the interior of Florida. 

This stone ])ossesses properties which evidently render it valuable as 
a material of construction, especially in the southern latitudes, where 
frost does not act as a disintegrating agent. It was examined by one 
of the southern chemists, who stated that it consisted almost entirely of 
silica and would be good for glass making. The examination of a thin 
section of this stone, however, indicated that it possesses such a peculiar 
structure, foreign to a quartz rock, that the necessity of analyses was 
suggested. These analyses were performed by Dr. A. B. Howe, upon 
two specimens taken from different jjortions of the quarry. The first 
specimen gave the following results :

The composition of this rock indicates therefore that it might be ad- 
vantageously employed as a fertilizing material. Although the per- 
centage of phosphoric acid is less than in the best Carolina phosphate, 
there is no lime to be neutralized by sulphuric acid before liberating the 
phosphoric acid. I am informed that the extent of the deposit which is 
represented by these analyses is very large. But the investigation of 
the value of this material as a fertilizer would of necessity involve 
further analyses and a more extensive investigation of this aspect of the 
question than interests us in our consideration of the substance as a 
building material. 

The microscopic structure of this rock indicates that it is composed 
largely of angular grains of sand which are cemented together by a 
fibrous material which is probably the phosphate, and by a simple re- 
fracting substance which appears to be a mixture of kaolin and hydrous 
silica. By treating the rock with caustic potash, Dr. Howe dissolved 
over 7 per cent, of silica from it. The solution used contained 50 per 
cent, of caustic potash (K O H.); in the first experiment 8.71 per cent, 
of silica was dissolved, and in the second 7.93 per cent, of silica. This 
determination is an indication that the hardening of the rock on expos- 
ure is due to the presence of this hydrous silica, which might be, in 
])art at least, in a gelatinous condition in the rock, when soaked with its 
quarry water. Owing to the nature of the components it is not easy 
to calculate the mineral nature of the phosphate, which is a])parently 
different in the two specimens analyzed. In the first case the acid is 
apparently combined with alumina and in the second case with lime.

NOTES OiV THE NATIVE TREES OF THE I,OAVER ^VABASH AIVI> 
WHITE KITER VAI,r,EVS, IN Il,I.IIVOIS AN© INUIAIVA. 

By ROBERT RIDGWAY. 

[The accompanying notes on the forest-growth of the Lower Wabash Valley were 
prepared originally for the use of Professor Sargent in his report upon the forest trees 
of North America for the Tenth Census. It being impossible, however, for him to 
utilize more than occasional extracts, he suggested to the writer their publication "ui 
toto in some convenient form," so that all interested in this important subject might 
have the benefit of these observations. It is, therefore, in deference to Professor Sar- 
gent's advice that the present paper is herewith presented.] 

INTRODUCTION. 

Although the flekl of this paper ostensibly iacliides the valley of the 
Wabash and that of its main tributary, White River, from the mouth of 
the former stream north to where the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad 
crosses them both (or from latitude 37^' 50' to 38° 50', approximately), 
it is proper to state that actual investigations have been made at very 
few points within the district named, and chiefly in the immediate 
vicinity of Mount Carmel, Wabash County, Illinois, which alone has 
been carefully explored. In the limited area .comprised within five 
miles' radius from Mount Carmel, 86 species of trees have been found 
growing wild, including several which are commonly classed as shrubs, 
but which there grow to a height of 30 feet or more. Rather protracted 
observations in Knox County, Indiana, some twenty-five miles to the 
northeast of Mount Carmel, and in Posey County, 20 miles or more 
southward, did not increase the list, but extremely desultory observa- 
tions, made by Dr. J. Schneck, of Mount Carmel, in Gallatin County, 
Illinois, near the mouth of the Wabash River, where the country is very 
broken, resulted in the addition of Juniperus virginiana, Chamccmjparis. 
sph(vroi(lea, and a Pimis ;* while White County, the next one south of 
Wabash, adds one more [Aralia .spinosa). Bobinia psendacacia occurs 
l)lentifully in the hilly districts in the southern part of both Illinois and 
Indiana, but has not been met with in the wild state by the writer. 

Halesia tetraptera is quoted from Evansville, Ind. (only forty miles 
south of Mount Carmel), and from " Southern Illinois"; while the Prince 
Maximilian von Wied, who passed one winter (October 10, 1832, to 
March 10, 1833) at New Harmony, Posey County, gives, in his Beise in 
das innere Nor d- America^] vol. i, p. 209, a list of about 60 species of 
trees which came under his observation in that vicinity, and among 
which are included several which have not been found by Dr. Schneck or 
myself, though it should be stated that our observations in Posey County 
have been confined to a very limited field. These species are, " Jwjlans''''

[= Carya] aquaUca, "J." [= C] myristiccvformis^ Acer '■'• striatum'" [= A. 
pennsylvanicum], Robiniapseudacacia, '' Cerasus^^ [= Primus] virginianus, 
and Nyssa sylvatica. It is, therefore, very likely that several species are 
to be added to those given in the ai^pended list, thus making an actual 
total of nearly 100 species of trees which are native to the valley of the 
lower Wabash. 

The most marked features of the woods in the region under consider- 
ation, as compared with those of more eastern districts, are, (1) the entire 
absence of coniferous trees, except in special and usually very restricted 
localities, and (2) the great variety of species growing together. They 
are emphatically "mixed woods," it being very rare indeed to find a 
single species predominating over all others, though in limited sections 
or particular localities one or another of the oaks (most frequently Q. 
alba) J the Sugar Maple or Sweet Gum, may largely prevail; indeed, even 
the Honey Locust and Catalpa have been noticed, in a single instance 
each, to form the prevailing growth on a restricted area. Usually, 
however, from 40 to 50 species of trees are mixed together indiscrimi- 
nately upon an area approximating, say, 50 to 75 acres, the relative 
abundance of the component species varying with the location, char- 
acter of soil, geological formation, and other local causes. The two fol- 
lowing lists, made on the spot, are given as typical : 

(1) Area, about 50 acres; situation, about 1^ miles west of Mount Carmcl, 
Wabash County, Illinois, in bottoms of Greathouse CreeJc; date, September 
10, 1876.

The following additional species grew within half a mile of the woods 
in question, some of them just beyond its borders : 

1. Tulip Poplar, Liriodendron tuUpifera. 

2. Box Elder, J^egundo aceroides. 

3. Stag-horn Sumac, Rhus typhina. 

4. Black Haw, Viburnum prunifoUum.

9. Post Oak, Quercus stellata. 

10. Hornbeam, Carpinus caroUniana. 

11. Black Willow, Salix nigra. 

12. Aspen, Populus tremuloides f 

Making a total of 58 species of trees, all " hard woods," actually found 
growing on an area of less than one mile square. In addition to these 
there would be added in certain portions of the river bottoms the fol- 
lowing, so that it is possible to find as many as 75 species on the same 
area in the vicinity of Mount Carmel : 
1. Linden, Tilia americana. 



52 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

2. Large-leafed Linden, Tilia Jieterophylla, 

3. Bnckeye, JEsculus glabra f 

4. Water Locust, Gleditschia monospernia.

6. Scarlet-fruited Thorn, Cratccgiis coccinea. 

7. "Ked Haw," Cratwgus suhvillosa. 

8. Service Tree, Amelanchier canadensis, 

9. Green Ash, Fraxinus viridis. 

10. Black Ash, Fraxinus sambucifoUa. 

11. Catalpa, Cafalpa speciosa. 

12. jMississippi Hackberry, Celtis mississippiensis. 

13. Overcup Oak, Quercus lyrata. 

14. Hop Hornbeam, Ostrya virginica. 

15. Beech, Fagus ferruginea. 
IG. Black Birch, Betula lenta. 

17. Bald Cypress, Taxodium distichum. 

The larger number of the species in the last list are, of course, more 
or less local, but it is believed that every one of them, and also those of 
the two i^receding lists (excepting, perhaps, Ulmus alata, Quercus fal- 
cata, Q. nigra, and Q. sfellata, which prefer poorer soils), could be found 
on an area of less than a square mile in extent, commencing at the bank 
of the Wabash Kiver, immediately above the mouth of White Biver, and 
extending back through t]ie cypress swamp to the bluffs which border 
the bottom lands. This gives for one square mile of woods, a grand 
total of more than 70 species of trees, not including several of the larger 
shrubs (as Amorpfha fruHcosa and Ilex verticillata), which here attain 
almost the stature of trees.

Originally, much the larger part of the district under consideration 
was heavily timbered, and at present the nearest actual prairies to 
Mount Carmel are distant about 20 to 30 miles in Lawrence and Kich- 
mond Counties, Illinois. Since the first settlement of the country,* 
however, the distribution of the timber has very materially changed, 
much of the original forest having been cleared for cultivation, while 
on the other hand nearly all the smaller i^rairies have become trans- 

* Mouut Carmel was laid out as a town iu 1818, but tlic suiTonnding couutry had 
already become sparsely settled.

formed into woodland. It is difficult to now estimate what proportioji 
of the orignal growth (considered as to area, little if any being now in 
its primitive condition) is now standing, but it is stated by those most 
competent to judge, that on account of this encroachment of the woods 
upon the former prairies, there is now a greater extent of woodland in 
Wabash and adjoining counties (in Illinois) then there was fifty years 
ago. The growth of this new forest is so rapid that extensive woods 
near Mount Carmel (consisting chiefly of Oaks and Hickories, averaging 
more than 80 feet high, and 1 to nearly 2 feet in diameter), were open 
prairie within the memory of some of the present owners of the land! 

The original growth of the richer bottom lauds and slopes of the bluffs 
was probably equal in magnitude to that of any other hard-wood forest 
in Eastern North America; at least the taller trees even now standing 
considerably exceed in height the dimensions given in standard text- 
books, and evidently based on the growth of other sections of the 
country. That this discrepancy of size indicates actual superiority I 
am, however, loth to believe, but am rather inclined to attribute it to a 
paucity of measurements of trees in other sections, a view of the case 
which is considerably strengthened by the fact that the diameter of the 
larger trees does not greatly exceed that attained in the original forest 
along the Atlantic seaboard, except, perhaps, in the case of particular 
species. Certain it is, that the virgin forests of the western slope of 
the Alleghanies, in West Virginia, and, possibly, that of some portions 
of Southern Ohio, appear to compare very favorably with those of the 
lower Wabash region ; at least that is the imi)ression which I have re- 
ceived from jiassing through them repeatedly by rail; while I am con- 
fident that in Jackson County, Indiana, near the line of the Ohio and 
Mississippi Railroad even a larger growth exists at the present time than 
in most parts of the Lower AVabash Valley, but I have no measurements 
wherewith to substantiate this impression. 

The investigations upon which my knowledge of the timber of the 
Lower Wabash region is based extend over many years, during which 
time an opportunity for taking a desirable measurement was never 
neglected. I have furthermore received nuich assistance from friends 
and correspondents interested in the subject, among whom I may 
especially mention Dr. J. Schneck, of Mount Carmel; his brother, 
Charles Schneck, of Posey County, Indiana; and Mr. Thos. J. Johnston, 
county surveyor of Posey County. Dr. Schneck has already published, 
in Professor Cox's Geological Survey of Indiana (volume for 1875, pp. 
501-579), a "Catalogue of the Flora of the Wabash Valley, below the 
mouth of White Eiver," in which may be found most important infor- 
mation respecting the subject in hand; and in reply to letters asking 
for measurements of the timber of their localities, both of the other 
gentlemen named above responded with the desired information. The 
measurements taken by Messrs. Johnston and Schneck are herewith 
given.

The heaviest timber in Posey County is said to be in Point Township, 
in the lower end of the county.

of trees, "the measurements in each case being those of one individual."

It may be remarked that the size indicated by the above figures is, 
in the case of some species, highly exceptional, and that I have meas- 
ured none so large. Not that a single one of the three measurements 
given is so very unusual (though this is in some cases true as regards 
height), but that it is exceedingly uncommon to find such extreme meas- 
urements of girth, length of trunk, and total height combined in a single 
tree. 

According to measurements thus far made it has been determined be- 
yond doubt that at least thirty-four species of trees reach or exceed a 
height of 100 feet, and it is all but certain that some ten or a dozen 
ra6re, of which no measurements have been taken, also reach this height. 
No less than eleven reach, occasionally, at least, a height of 150 feet, the 
greatest height of any tree, so far as determined by accurate measure- 
ments, being 190 feet {Liriodendron); two (Liriodcndron and Quercus 
coccinea, fide Dr. Schneck) reach a height of 180 feet; four reach 170 feet;

The following list of the species determined as growing to 100 feet

In addition to the above there are several other trees large specimens 
of which have not been measured, but which, with scarce a doubt, occa- 
sionally, at least, reach 100 feet in height, thus rendering it very prob- 
able that in reality about fifty species attain this elevation. These spe- 
cies are the following : 



* 1. Magnolia acuminata. 
2. Tilia heterophylla. 

* 3. Eohinia pseudacacia. 

4. Frunus serotina. 

5. Fraximis pubescens. 

6. Fraxinus sanibucifolia. 

7. Fraxinus viridis. 

8. Geltis mississippiensis. 

9. Carya porcina. 



10. Carya sulcata. 

11. Qucrcus micliauxi. 

12. Qiiercus falcata. 

13. Quercus lyrata. 

14. Quercus stellata. 

* 15. Castanea vulgar is^ americana. 

* IG. ChamcGcy pilar is spliwroidea. 
*17. Finns {mitisf). 



* These trees, though growing within the field of this paper, have not been met with 
by the writer.

The raeasurements given under the head of the species enumerated 
in the following list include all the reliable ones which 1 have made up 
to date, or which I have been able to get upon unimpeachable authority, 
and, it should be understood, cancel all measurements or estimates pre- 
viously published by me ivhen in excess of those here given. They include 
no estimates of height, but only actual tape-line measurements of pros- 
trate trees or else very careful measurements of isolated standing trees 
with a thoroughly-tested " dendrometer," although the specimens meas- 
ured by the latter method are very few indeed. 

The following species, usually classed as shrubs, are not included, 
though some of them may occasionally reach 30 feet in height, l^o 
measurements, however, have been taken of any of them : 

1. Xanthoxylum americanum. Prickly Ash. 

2. Ptelea trifoliata. Hop Tree ; Wafer Ash. 

3. Euonymus atroimrpureus. Burning Bush ; Waahoo. 

4. Hydrangea arhorescens. Wild Hydrangea. 

5. Hamamelis virginica. Witch Hazel. 

6. Ilex decidua. Deciduous Holly. 

7. Forestiera acuminata. Forestieria. 

8. Lindera benzoin. Spice Bush. 

9. Alnus serrulata. Smooth Alder. 

10. Aralia sjnnosa. Hercules' Club ; " Devil's walking-stick." 
On the other hand, a small number which are not usually classed as 
trees are so considered here, having been found to attain, occasionally, 
at least, a height of 30 feet or more. They are the following :

CATALOGUE. 

1. (1.) * Magnolia acuminata. Cucumber Tree. 

I have never seen a tree of this species growing in any part of the 
district under consideration. I have heard, however, that a few grow 
on Sugar Creek, in the southern part of Wabash County, but have been 
unable to verify the rumor. It grows quite abundantly in the extreme 
southern portion of Illinois (Johnson and Union Counties), where the 



*Tbemiiuber in parentliesis prefixed to the name of a species corresponds in each 
case -with that given in Professor Sargent's Catalogue of the Forest Trees of North 
America, published by the Census Bureau (Washington, 1881). When no second num- 
ber is given, the si)ecies is one not included in the catalogue in question.

couutry is very billy, and therefore adapted to it. The nearest point in 
Indiana where I can iind a record of its occurrence is Orange County, 
the third county east from Knox. 
2. (8.) Liriodendron tulipifera. Tulip Tree ; " Poplar." 

Formerly very abundant, and still common in some localities. The 
great demand for poplar lumber for weatherboarding, etc., has greatly 
depleted the supply, however. Although growing both on the hills and 
in the river bottoms, the growth of the former will probably average 
larger than the latter. The larger trees of this species now standing 
will average about 5 feet diameter and 140 feet high, though specimens 
of much larger size may still be found, and formerly were numerous. 
A few yet exist, having a diameter of 7 or even 8 feet, but they are ex- 
ceedingly rare. Straight trunks of 50 to 70 feet clear are occasionally 
found, and twenty years ago trunks 100 feet long were not so very uu- 
frequent. 

Lumbermen recognize three varieties of the "poplar"— the "yellow," 
"white," and "blue," distinguished, however, only by the color of the 
wood. The first is the most abundant, and produces the best lumber. 

This species flowers during the first half of May, leafing the first 
half of April.

Tbie measurements are in feet. 



60 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

With the exception of the last two, the trees of the above list were 
all felled, and the total length measured with a 100-foot tape-line. The 
two exceptions were fine, vigorous, standing trees, and their height meas- 
ured with a " dendrometer." Standiug isolated, this was easily done, 
and the measurements are no doubt perfectly accurate. 

The finest tree of all those given above was exami)le q ,which at 74 feet 
measured 6 feet in diameter, the trunk being iJerfectly sonnd even at 
the extreme base, and straight as a column. 

The longest trunk (example u) was cut into ten 12-foot logs. It was not 
very large, however, measuring, if I remember rightly, about 1 leet in 
diameter at the butt and less than three feet through at the top of the 
last cut. A trnnk measuring 84 feet in length (sawed into seven 12- 
foot logs), measured 54 inches in diameter at the butt and 42 inches at 
the small end of the last cut. This is the tree marked & in the list. 

At the "Timber Settlement" in Wabash County, I measured, in May, 
1881, a solid stump of this tree, which, although entirely denuded of bark 
and with a considerable iiortion hewn off for firewood, was still 20 feet in 
circumference at 4 feet from the ground. A portion of the trunk still 
lying on the ground was 50 feet or more in length, and had apparently 
supplied the occupants of a deserted cabin near by with firewood for 
many years. 

The example marked v was 35 feet in circumference at the ground, 
and at 150 feet from the base the several branches were 1 to 1^ feet 
in diameter. The top branches, broken off and scattered by the falling 
of the tree, had been collected for firewood, so that its total height 
could not be measured, but could not have been much less than 190 
feet, which is the maximum height as given by Dr. Schneck in his 
"Flora of the Wabash Valley " (Cox's Geological Sitrvey of Indiana^ 
1875, p. 512). 

3. (10.) Asimina triloba. Pawpaw. 

The Pawpaw is a very abundant underwood in all bottom lands and 
other damp woods, growing usually to a height of 20 to 30 feet, and 2 
or 3 inches in diameter, but not unfrequently 40 feet or more in height, 
and, in exceptional cases, nearly a foot in diameter. The two largest 
specimens measured (both in the bottoms below Mount Carmel) were 46 
and 43 feet, respectively, in height, the larger being 32 inches in cir- 
cumference, the smaller only 10 inches around. 

Two well-marked varieties are distinguished by the fruit, which in one 
has the pulp a rich golden yellow, very aromatic, and exceedingly sweet, 
and much liked by most people, though too rich for many. This variety 
is known as the " Yellow Pawpaw " ; the other, called " White Paw])aw," 
has a whitish or very faintly yellow, insipid, or disagreeable tasting 
fruit, and is seldom eaten. I am unable to state whether any peculiarity 
of flower or foliage distiuguishes the two varieties. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 61 

4, (14.) Tilia americana. American Linden. " Lin." 

A very common tree, growing cbiefl}^ near the river banks, but occur- 
ring- in ail ricli woods. The average height of the larger trees is about 
100 feet, but an elevation of 125 or even 130 feet is sometimes reached, 
the diameter of large trees averaging about 3 feet. In the Wabash bot- 
toms single trunks of the " Lin" are exceedingly rare, fully 80 per cent, 
of the trees consisting of compound trunks, as if several trees had grown 
up close together and become more or less completely coalesced at the 
base. 

The following measurements are of trees of rather exceptional size :

Dr. J. Schncck. 



Example h was the largest I have seen, but was divided into three 
trunks a short distance from the ground. 

5. (15.) TUia heterophylla. White Basswood. 

This tree has been found near Mount Carmel by Dr. Schneck, but I am 
not autoptically acquainted with it. Possibly some of the measurements 
given under the head of T. americana belong to this species. 

6. ( — .) Ilex verticiliata. Black Alder. 

Very abundant about the borders of ponds and swamps, and the 
mouths of the creeks, forming dense almost impenetrable thickets. In 
some localities it grows to a height of 20 feet and upwards, with a stem 2 to 
nearly 3 feet in circumference. The two largest measured were 2 feet 
11 inches, and 2^ feet, respectively, in girth, and the tallest (cut down 
especially for measurement) 28 feet high. Taller specimens, which were 
apparently about 35 feet high, were seen in the Cypress swamp, in the 
lower part of Knox County, Indiana. 

7. {AOf) ^sculus glabra? Smooth Buckeye! 

Although I give the species as ^. glabra, on the strength of Dr. 
Schneck's identification, I am not sure but that we have the JE. fxiva 
also. The specimens examined by me (a considerable number, in the 
bottoms nearly opposite the village of Eochester, Wabash County), 



62 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

were 70 or 80 feet high, and some of them 2 feet or more in diameter, 
thus appearing too large for JE. glabra. Whichever it may be, how- 
ever, the Buckeye is a very local tree in the Wabash Valley, and I have 
only seen it in the locality mentioned, where it appears to be confined 
wholly to a belt of only a few hundred yards width, a few trees only 
being found on the opposite side of the river. I am unable to ascribe 
any reason for this restriction of its range, since the same trees, and 
other vegetation associated with it, occur throughout the bottoms on 
either side. It is said to be common among the hills of Gibson County, 
several miles back from the river, and there to attain a height of 100 feet 
or more, and a diameter of 3 feet. 

8. (47.) Acer dasycarimm. Silver Maple. 

A very abundant tree along the banks of rivers and large streams, 
attaining an average elevation of 90 to 100 feet, and a diameter of 2 to 3 
feet. Unlike the Eed Maple {A. ruhrum) the trunk usually divides low 
down, usually at about 8 to 15 feet from the ground; the three or more 
secondary trunks, however, extending upward for a considerable dis- 
tance before branching. 

Of four trees measured, the extremes were: height, 90 and 118 feet; 
circumference, 12^ to 14 feet; trunk, 20 feet (only one measured). 

Flowers early in April, leafing from March 31 to April 12. 

9. (51.) Acer ruhrum. Eed Maple. 

A very common tree, but much more local than A. dasycarpum. Is 
almost wholly confined to swamps or A^ery wet bottoms, where it grows 
tall, straight, and slender. In size it is about equal to A. dasycarpum 
and A. saccharinum, but is much more slender than either, with a less 
spreading top. Three specimens measured 70 to 108 feet in height, the 
average being 95 J feet; lOi to 15 feet in circumference (average 12.83), 
clear trunk, 49 to 60 feet. Decidedly taller trees occur, however, those 
measured being prostrate ones, of by no means the largest size. 

Flowers middle of February to Marcb 20, according to the season; 
leafs out last of March to April 12. — (Schneok.) 

10. (52.) Acer saccharinnm. Sugar Maple. 

A very abundant tree in some localities, rare or wholly wanting in 
other portions. Occasional "sugar groves" occur where, over a space 
of several acres, scarcely a single tree of any other species can be found. 

The larger trees of this species average about 100 feet high (the aver- 
age of the five specimens measured being 108| feet, the extremes 90 and 
118), and 2^ to 3, occasionally over 4, feet in diameter. The trunk, like 
that of A. ruhrum, is frequently tall and straight, fonr specimens meas- 
ured being, respectively, 47, 48, 60, and 70 feet to the first limb. The 
var. nigrum and the common form appear to be about equally numerous, 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 63 

each, however, predominating, or even wholly replacing the other, in 
particular localities. 

Flowers as early as March 10 (Schneck), leafing April 15 to 20. 

11. (53.) Negundo aceroides. Box Elder. 

A very coffmou, and in some localities abundant, underwood in rich 
bottoms. The larger trees of this species are 2i to 3 — rarely 1 — feet in 
diameter, and 50 to 60, possibly 70, feet high. No measurements for 
height have been made, but the tallest specimens do not approach the 
elevation of the oaks and other trees with which they are associated. 

Flowers March 20, leafing the last week in April. 

12. (56.) Rhus typMna. Stag-horn Sumac. 

In most localities less common than B. glabra. The largest speci- 
mens observed were about 30 to 35 feet high, and 4 inches in diameter. 

13. ( .) Rhus glabra. Smooth Sumac. 

Much the commonest species, and when growing in woods or thickets 
attaining a height of 30 to 35 feet. ]S"ear Monteur's Pond, in Knox 
County, Indiana, I found this species and R. copalUna growing together, 
and to about an equal size. 

14. ( .) Rhus copallina. "Dwarf Sumac." (!) 

A very common species in some localities. Near the northwestern 
border of Monteur's Pond, in Knox County, Indiana, it is an abundant 
underwood, growing frequently to a height of 25 to 30 feet, and 4 inches 
or over hi diameter. Three specimens (the only ones measured) were, 
respectively, 25^, 31i and 32^ feet in height (all being cut down for 
measurement), 6, 7, and IJ feet trunk, and 14, 8, and 29 inches in cir- 
cumference. The last consisted properly three stems united at the base, 
though near the ground the coalescence of the wood was almost com- 
plete, while externally there was no evidence of the triple nature of the 
trunk. A section of this trunk, also leaves and fruit of the same tree, 
has been deposited in the museum of the Agiicultural Department. 

15. ( .) Amorpha fruticosa. False Indigo. 

In the cypress swamps of Knox County, Indiana, I found this shrub 
growing to a very unusual size, many specimens being 20 feet and up- 
wards in height. The largest one seen was cut down for measurement, 
and found to be 35 feet high; it was 17 inches in circumference at the 
base, and contained eighteen annual rings. 

16. (65.) Gymnodadus canadensis. Coflfee-bean; Coffee-nut. 
Scarcely one of our native trees is more local in its distribution than 

the present species, and there are few localities indeed where it can be 
said to be abundant. It is usually found scattered through the richer 
bottoms. 



64 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

It is never a large tree, but grows tall and slender, frequently reacli- 
iug 100 feet in height, though seldom over 2 feet in diameter, and with 
a rather scant top. One tree, cut expressly for measurement, was 109 
feet in length, 76 feet to the first limb, and only 20 inches in diameter 
across the stump. The largest trunk was that of a tree growing in a 
door-yard, and possibly a cultivated specimen. It was 8 feet in circum- 
ference, but ramified at about 4 feet from the ground into several up- 
right branches. The top was dense and symmetrical, the summit ele- 
vated about 80 feet. 

17. (GQ.) Gleditschia monosperma. Water Locust. 

An abundant species in the cypress swamps in the lower part of Knox 
County, Indiana, where it grows along with the Large-leafed Cottonwood 
{Populus hef€roj)hylla), White Ash {Fraximts amerieana), Black Willow 
{Salix nigra), and other swamp trees. It is a very much smaller tree 
than G. triacanthos and of quite different appearance, having a smooth- 
ish, dull-gray bark (much like that of the Hackberry, Celtis), and very 
crooked, scraggy growth. The largest specimen measured was 7 feet 
in circumference and 65 feet in height. 

18. (67.) Gleditschia triacanthos. Honey Locust. 

When growing to its full perfection, the Honey Locust is one of the 
most majestic trees of the forest in whicli it is native. Many trees 
occur which are 120 to nearly 140 feet high, with straight trunks of 50 to 
70 feet clear, and 1 to 5, occasionally even 6, feet in diameter. There are 
none of onr trees, excepting only the Bald Cypress and Catalpa, which 
have a more thoroughly characteristic appearance, its tall, straight, but 
usually inclined trunk of a dark iron-gray or nearly black color being 
much darker than any other species, and thus easily identified at a con- 
siderable distance, while the extremely delicate foliage renders its top 
equally conspicuous by its contrast with the adjacent tree tops. The 
Honey Locust usually, like very many other trees, occurs singly 
throughout the richer woods, but it is occasionally multiplied so as to 
torm the prevailing growth. It was found thus multiplied over an area 
of a hundred acres or more in the AVhite Elver bottoms of Gibson 
County, Indiana, where the trees of this species constituted more than 
half the forest, and averaged 2 to 3 feet in diameter and 100 feet high, 
with occasional specimens of considerably larger size. 

The fiuest tree of this species which I have ever seen was an isolated 
oue standing near the roadside in Posey County, Indiana. It was tall 
and straight, with a widely- spread, symmetrical top, the trunk measur- 
ing 18 feet in circumference at a yard from the ground, and about 60 
feet to the first limbs. It was apparently sound throughout, and was 
not less than 120 feet high.

22. (78.) Primus cMcasa. Chickasaw Plum. 

Wild Plums are very abundant, but whether the F. chicasa is common 

in the wild state I do not know. I have seen cultivated trees, however, 

which were about 20 feet high and nearly a foot in diameter. P. amer- 

ieana is usually 15 to 20, sometimes 30 feet high, and flowers April 10. 

Proc. Nat. Mus. 82 5 June 12, 1882. 



66 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

23. {81.) Prunus serotina. "Wild Cherry." 

Once very common, the wild cherry is now rare in most portions of 
the Wabash Valley. It is partial to the hilly country back from the 
river, and it is there that the trees of this species attain the largest size. 
They were formerly found 100 or more feet high and 3 to 4 feet in di- 
ameter, and a few may ijerhaps still be found having this stature. I 
have measured but a single tree of this species, however, the one in 
question being 7J feet in girth, 31 feet to the first branch, and 94 feet 
high, being by no means so large as some that might be found. 

Flowers about the middle of April, leafing a little later. 

24. (86.) Pirns angustifolia. Narrow- leaved Crab Apple. 

This species has been found in Wabash County by Dr. J. Schneck 
(see Cox's Geological Survey of Indiana, 1875, j). 528). It is perhaps not 
so common as P. coronaria, but blooms at about the same time. Ac- 
cording to Dr. S. it is " usually taller than P. coronaria.''^ 

25. (87.) Pirns coronaria. Crab Apple. 

Common in rich woods, sometimes forming extensive thickets. I 
have made no measurements, but would say ihat trees 25 to 30 feet high 
and nearly a foot in diameter are occasionally found ; trunks 6 to 8 
inches through, being, however, more common. It blooms in April and 
May, leafing about the middle of ihe former month. 

26. (94.) Cratwgus coccinea. Scarlet-fruited Thorn. 

"(3pen upland woods; not rare; April, May." (Schneck.) No 
measurements taken. 

27. (95.) Cratccgus cordafa. Washington Thorn. 

Given in Patterson's catalogue of the plants of Illinois on Dr. 
Schneck's authority' . 

28. (96.) Cratwgus crus-galli. Cockspur Thorn. 

"Low moist thickets; common; March to May." (Schneck.) No

29. (101.) Cratoegus subvillosa. " Red Haw." 

Eiver banks chiefly; common; blossoms in April and May. A spec- 
imen (cut down) measured 37 feet in height, 2^ feet in circumference.

32. (lOG.) Liquidamhar styraciflua. Sweet Gum. 

One of tlie most ahuudaut trees in the river bottoms, where in some 
places it constitutes the prevailing growth. It is one of the tallest and 
stateliest of forest trees, frequently attaining an elevatiou of 130 feet, 
and occasionally of 1.30 feet or more, with straight trunks GO to 80 
feet clear and 4 feet in diameter. Only the Tulip Tree {Liriodendroii) 
rivals it in altitude of the trunk, but in symmetry cannot be compared 
to it, except in occasional instances. As frequently seen, it has by far 
the tallest and straightest shaft of any tree in the forest. One trunk 
71 feet long measured only 8 inches less in diameter at the small end 
than at the lower, where the diameter was a little less than 3 feet. 
Another trunk 94 feet long was only Hi feet in girth at the large end. 
The two largest specimens seen each measured 17 feet in circumference, 
one of them having a trunk of 80 feet clear. The tallest tree measured 
was one cut for lumber, and was 101 feet in total length. 

Blossoms in May.

3^ and 4^ feet in circumference, with trunks 30 feet clear. The total 
height of the first (a standing tree) was estimated at CO feet; the latter 
(prostrate, and measured with tape-line) was 50 feet long. 
Blossoms in April or May, and commences to leaf about April 20. 

35. (119?) Nyssa multifloraf "Black Gum." 

A very abundant tree both on uplands and in the bottoms. Grows tall 
and slender, with few large branches except at the extreme summit, but 
the trunk frequently thickly set with small horizontal branches to near 
the ground, thus closely approximating the "excurrent" growth charac- 
teristic of many Conifercc. Growing on thin or dry soils, its height does 
not usually much exceed 70 or 80 feet, but on rich lands an elevation of 
100 to 120 feet or more is sometimes reached, one specimen being 125 
feet long, 13 feet in circumference, and the trunk entirely free from 
branches for 64 feet. An exceptionally large specimen, which may pos- 
sibly have been N. imiflora, growing in the bottoms of Posey County, 
Indiana (but not in water), was 18 feet in circumference, and propor- 
tionately tall. 

It may be that some of our so called "Black Gums" may be iV. syl- 
ratica, but of this I am not certain.

39. (143.) Diospyros virginiana. Persimmon. 

Common everywhere. When growing in the thick bottom -forest is 
frequently 100 feet or more in height, the tallest specimen measured 
being 115 feet high, 80 feet to the first limb, but only 5^ feet in girth at 
the base, or less than 2 feet in diameter! When growing in open fields 
or along roadsides (where it is most frequently seen), it forms a more 
spreading tree, usually 30 to 40, and rarely more than 50, feet high. 

40. (148.) Fraxinus americana. White Ash. 

Very common in the bottom lands, where it becomes one of the very

very wet lands it becomes greatly enlarged at the base, some such 
trees measuring 30 feet in girth at the ground, but rapidly contracting, 
so that at 20 feet they diminish one-half to two-thirds in bulk. These 
"swell-butt ashes" are said to decay lirst at the top, and to be sometimes 
solid at the base. Following is a list of measurements of large trees of 
this species:

41. (154.) Fraxinus imhescens. Red Ash.

42. (155. j Fraxinus samhucifolia. "Black Ash"; "Hoop Ash." 

" Swamps and wet places; not rare." (Schneck.) Abundant in the 
northern portion of Monteur's Pond, Knox County, Indiana, where it 
grows tall and slender, frequently 80 and occasionally nearly or quite 
100 feet high, the only specimen measured being 83 feet long, trunk 57 
feet, diameter (at 5 feet from the ground — the base being considerably 
swollen), li feet. This tree presents so very close a resemblance in 
bark, foliage, and general aspect to young Pecan trees {Garya olivcefor- 
mis), as to be not readily distinguished, except by experts. 

43. (158.) Fraxinus quadrangulata. Blue Ash. 

Common in rich hilly woods; resembles in general appearance F. 
amerlcana, but is smaller and more slender. Four freshly cut trees, 
felled on a space including not more than two acres, were 2 to 2^ feet 
iu diameter (across top of stump), 51 to 70 feet clear trunk, and 116 to 
124 feet long. A fine tree still standing on the same piece of ground 
was 13 feet in girth, and at least 50 feet to the first limb.

44. (157.) Fraxinvs viridis. Greeu Ash. 

Not uncommou in wet woods ; uo measurements. 

45. (165.) Catalpa speciosa. Catalpa; "Patalpha"; "Wahoo." 
Formerly abundant in rich bottom lands, but now nearly exterminated 

in many localities. Trees of 100 feet or more in height were formerly 
not uncommon, while a diameter of 4J feet has been reported (see Cox's 
Geological Purvey of Indiana, 1873, p. 417). The usual dimensions, 
however, are, for the larger trees, 70 to 00 feet high, and 2J to 3 feet 
diameter. It is usually, however, decidedly smaller, and when growing 
in open situations forms a low spreading tree, seldom more than 50 feet 
in height, and frequently much less. Trees of this character were form- 
erly very abundant in the bottoms about a mile above Mount Carmel, 
but they have nearly all been cut for fence-posts. 

In Posey County, Indiana, while making inquiries of an intelligent 
gentleman regarding the timber of his neighborhood, 1 was informed 
that the day before he had cut a Catalpa, the trunk of which produced 
eight 7 foot post-cuts, the diameter at the base being 4 feet, while the 
total length of the tree he estimated at about 130 feet. 

Blossoms late in May or early in June (seen in full bloom near the O. 
and M. K. R., between Shoals and Huron, Indiana, May 30, 1881.)

46. (171.) Sassafras officinale. Sassafras. 

Yery common, and in rich woods growing to a large size. The lumber 
of this tree is more highly prized than any other for skiffs, being light, 
strong, and durable. It is also much used for fence-posts and rails. 
Although averaging perha]^s not more than 50 feet in height and a foot 
in diameter it is occasionally much larger, reaching in rare instances a 
diameter of 4 feet. The largest trees measured by me, however, were 
nnich less, being respectively, 7, Ih, and 7f feet m girth ; the last 00 
feet high, with a clear trunk of 30 feet; the second 95 feet high, with a 
trunk 75 feet long. 

47. (176.) Ulmns alata. Winged Elm. 

A rather rare tree, chiefly in river bottoms and along banks of 
streams; no measurements. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 71 

48. (177.) Ulmns anerimna. White Elm; "Eed Elm." 

A very common tree, most abundant in rich bottoms, where it attains 
a large size. Trees fully equaling the finest New England specimens are 
not uncommon, many being 5 feet in diameter and 120 feet or more in 
height. A very remarkable specimen was seen in the bottoms below 
Mount Carmel. It had grown in a thick wood, but the surrounding trees 
having been cleared away, was thus exposed to full view. The truuk, 
3^ feet in diameter, extended straight upward like a shaft or column 
for about 40 feet, and then gradually enlarged, and subdivided, the sub- 
divisions coalescing in places, but finally taking the character of distinct 
branches, of which about 13 could be counted; these main upright 
branches gradually diverged, now and then dividing, to near the top, 
which was gracefully inclined outwards all round, and with an ex- 
tremely regular outline. This bouquet-shaped top had an ambitus of 
about 50 feet, while its summit was elevated about 120 feet above the 
ground. In the immediate vicinity of Mount Carmel are several very 
beautiful elm trees of the dome-sliaped type, one having an ambitus of 
about 90 feet, the ends of the branches nearly touching the ground, and 
the total height about 70 or 75 feet. Another one expands 01 feet, 
though the total height of the tree is scarcely 00 feet, and the diameter 
of its truuk only a little over 3 feet. It is needless to remark that both 
these trees are completely isolated. The largest specimen which I have 
measured was 16 feet in circumference (above the spurs), the trunk un- 
divided for about 50 feet, and the total height more than 120 feet. The 
ambitus of this tree was 105 feet, but another, also a very large tree, 
expanded 111 feet. 

A conspicuous peculiarity of this tree, when growing in wet situa- 
tions, consists in the very prominent si)urs or buttresses thrown out 
from the base. These thin walls extend sometimes many feet from the 
body of the tree, some specimens with a trunk 3 feet or less in diameter 
above the spurs being 12 to 15 feet in diameter at the ground. The 
only other tree exhibiting this feature to a marked degree is the Red 
Oak [Quercus rubra), in which, however, the spurs are thicker and do 
not project so far as they do with the present species in extreme cases. 
The White Elm is the tree to which the mistletoe {Phoradendron Jia- 
vcscens) is most partial, fully 90 per cent, of the trees affected by this 
parasite in the White Elver and Wabash bottoms being elms; in fact, 
I have never seen it except on this tree and the Honey Locust {Gledit- 
schia triacanthos). In the vicinity of Evansville, howe\er, only 40 miles 
southeast from Mount Carmel, the case is said to be quite different, a(i- 
cording to Professor John Collett, who gives a list of thirteen species of 
trees ui)on which this parasite was found growing, the BlacJv Gum being, 
first, the ''Ited Elm" {i. e., JJlmus americana) second, and the Honey 
Locust fifth, in the order of numbers upon which it grows. (See Cox's- 
Geologkal Survey of Indiana, 1875, p. 242.)

Flowers March 10 to 20, and begins to leaf the last week in April. 

49.(179.) Ubnusfulva. " Slippery Elm." 

A common tree in rich woods, but much less abundant than U. amer- 
icana. Grows commonly from 50 to 70 feet high, and 1^ to 2 feet in 
diameter, although much larger specimens undoubtedly occur. No 
measurements, however, have been taken. 

50. (183.) Celtis mississippiensis. Mississippi Hackberry. 

A very common tree, though less numerous than C. occidentalism with 
which it is found associated in very rich bottoms. It is usually a 
smaller tree than that species, commonly 60 to 80 feet high, the branches 
growing lower down, the bark of the trunk covered with prominent 
warty excrescences, and the leaves smaller, more coriaceous, and entire. 
The only specimen measured was 60 feet high and 11 in circumference. 

51. (184.) Celtis occidentalis. Hackberry. 

A very tall and beautiful tree in rich bottoms, growing frequently 120 
to 130 feet high and 3 feet in diameter, with a tall, straight trunk of 60 
to 70, or even 80, feet to the first limb. When growing to its full per- 
fection iu a dense forest, there is an individuality in the aspect of this 
tree which it is difficult to describe. It does not excel either in height 
or girth, yet it has the appearance of being one of the very tallest trees 
in this lofty forest, this illusion being doubtless due to the extreme slen- 
derness and great length of the trunk, which not unfrequently comprises 
three fourths of the total height of the tree, the smooth, gray bark con- 
spicuously clouded on the north side, with blackish moss or lichen for 
tiie entire length. This striking api)earance is sometimes still further 
increased by vines of the Virginia Creei^er ascending to the topmost 
branches, which are wreathed and matted with its foliage. Although 
83 feet is the greatest length of the tape-line actually stretched along a

53. (191.) Platanus occidentalis. Sycamore. 

This" very abundant tree is unquestionably the largest hard- wood of 
North America, though there are several which it does not excel in 
height. The largest specimens are 140 to 100 feet high, with an am- 
bitus of 100 to 130 feet, the diameter of single trunks averaging 5 to 7 
feet, but of compound trunks (i. e., those which fork comparatively 
near the ground), 8 to 10 feet. The chief superiority of the Sycamore 
over other trees, in point of size, consists, however, in the massiveness 
of the branches, each of the principal limbs of a very large tree of this 
species fully equaling an average forest tree in bulk. Twelve trees 
measured the same day in the bottoms of Gibson County, Indiana, be- 
low the mouth of Patoka Creek, averaged 127 feet spread of top and 23| 
feet in circumference, the extremes being 100 to 135 and 14 to 30 feet;

two Other trees bad an ambitus of 108 and 97 feet, respectively, while 
another was 33 feet in girth. These being all standing trees, their 
height could not be measured accurately, but not one of them was less 
than 100 feet high. The average height of eight trees, which are all 
that have been actually measured, was 145^ feet, the extremes being 
120 and 108 feet. 

Begins to leaf May 1.

a. This is probably the largest tree of any kind which I have seen 
anywhere in the Wabash Valley, or any other part of the Eastern Pro- 
vince of North America. It is of very vigorous growth, and apparently 
perfectly sound. Circumference at the ground, 42 feet; round smallest 
part of the trunk, 30 feet; greatest diameter, 15 feet, least diameter, 
10 feet, the average diameter being about 11 feet. Ambitus, 134 feet 
in one direction, the least spread of top being 112 feet. Total height, 
as determind by several measurements with "dendrometer," and by 
shadow, about 160 feet. The trunk first divides at about 7 feet from 
the ground, but above this division the main stem is still 8 feet in dia- 
meter; this extends upward, (jraduaUy enlarging^ to about 15 feet from 
the ground, where the next division takes place, the next fork being nearly 
30 feet up. Xo horizontal branches are thrown out until a height of 
70 or 80 feet is reached (or about half the total height of the tree), the

great bulk of tlie broadly spreading top beiug elevated above 90 feet 
from the ground. 

h. This tree, though slightly less iu diameter and spread of top, is a 
more symmetrical, aud iu this respect a decidedly finer tree than the 
preceding. Although the trunk first ramifies at a distance of about 18 
feet from the ground, both forks extend straight upward, the larger 
striight as a column, aud averaging about C teet in diameter, for 53 
feet, the smaller 70 feet or more (but the upper portion curving grace- 
fully outward). The top constitutes, when in full leaf, a compact dome 
of foliage, the great bulk of which constitutes the upper third of the 
total height. The tree is in perfect vigor, without a single dead branch, 
and showing no signs of decay about the base. Its trunk is wreathed 
with vines of the Virginia Creeper, which, extending upward for more 
than 100 feet, show in beautiful contrast to the smooth snow white bark 
of the larger branches and upper portion of the trunk. 

c. Trunk divides at about 10 or 12 feet from the ground, where the 
circumference is much greater than at the ground. 

r. Probably the handsomest trunk of any sycamore which I have ever 
seen. It rises like a huge column, 8 feet in average diameter, without 
any perceptible diminution for at least 40 feet, from a widely expanded 
base, measuring 17 feet in diameter and ignore than 50 feet in circum- 
ference, from which spring four "sprouts," the largest of which is 
nearly three feet in diameter, and all extending nearly straight upward, 
to almost the height of the main tree. The base is covered with dark 
green moss, and the trunk ornamented with the Virginia creeper. The 
trunk is hollow, and has recently been disfigured on one side by the axe 
of some vandal. 

u. Not a handsome tree, the three main forks widely diverging. 
y and z. Solid trees, newly felled, growing only 11* feet apart! 
a'. 84 feet to second limb. 

The decaying prostrate remains were found iu the bottoms of Gibson 
County, Indiana, a short distance below Mount Carmel, of a huge syca- 
more, which must have been much larger than any tree that I have 
measured. The space covered by the crumbled base was 60 feet in 
circumference. The three upright forks, found lying near together, 
two of them still united, the other broken off, were each 5 feet iu 
diameter, and careful measurements of them indicated a circumference 
of about 63 feet, below their ramification, which took place some 20 
feet from the ground, and the base of the tree. Each of the three 
trunks, which were still intact, though much decayed exteriorly, was 
70 feet long, but the branches were, of course, entirely decayed. When 
standing in its full vigor, this tree must have been a grand one, indeed. 
There is said to be still standing, near Worthington, Greene County, 
Indiana, a tree of this species which has a solid trunk measuring 48 feet 
in circumference, and dividing at 25 feet into three or four main branches, 
the largest of which is more than 5 feet in diameter. — (See Case\s Bo- 
tanical Index, April, 1880, and Botanical Gazette, June, 1880, p. 70.)

By no means a common tree, except in certain restricted localities. 
Though very much inferior to J. nigra in stature, it sometimes attains a 
considerable size, two felled trees, in the "Timber Settlement," Wabash 
County, measuring 97 and 117 feet in length, and each 1 foot 10 inches 
in diameter, with clear trunks 50 and 32 feet long. These trees grew 
withiu a few rods of one another, the species being very common in 
that locality. 

55. (196.) Juglans nigra. Black Walnut; "Walnut." 

The Black Walnut was, originally, a very abundant tree throughout 
the rich bottom lands of the Wabash and White Rivers, but is now rap- 
idly becoming scarce. Trees of this species, 5 or 6 feet in diameter, 
with straight, solid trunks 40 to GO feet in the clear, were formerly com- 
mon, but the finest trees have long been destroyed. Eight walnut 
trees, of less than medium size, were found freshly felled, in the bot 
toms of Greathouse Creek, about two miles west of Mount Carmel, and 
carefully measured, with the following result: Average length, 100^ 
feet; average length of trunk, 47^ feet; average circumference, 9^ feet. 
Extreme measurements: length, 97^ to 119^; trunk, 35 J to CO; circum- 
ference, 8 to lOJ. In the river bottoms the growth is much larger. One 
very fine tree measured 5J feet across the top of the stump, 42^ feet to 
the first limb, 75 feet to the second limb, and 131 feet to the extreme 
top. A perfectly sound and very symmetrical standing tree, of which 
photographs were taken, measured 18 feet in girth at a yard from the 
ground, had an ambitus of 97 feet, and was little, if any, less than 150 
feet high, the trunk alone being over 70 feet to the first limb, on main 
fork. 

Tiie following measurements represent, very fairly, the size of Black 
Walnut trees which have been cut for lumber in the vicinity of Mount 
Carmel :

56. (198.) Caryaalha. " Sbell-bark." 

Very common, attaiiiiug its greatest size on rich sand ridges in the 
bottom lands, where si)ecimens 3 to 4 feet in diameter and 130 feet or 
more high are not rare. The maximum height attained by this species 
has not been ascertained, but it is one of the very tallest trees of the 
forest, the tough and elastic top branches not being liable to be broken 
by the wind, as is so often the case with tall " Poplars" and " Sycamores." 
Some tall shell-barks are certainly 150 feet high, and probably more, 
many trunks, apparently constituting less than half the total height, 
being 70 or 80 feet to the first limb. The following measurements may 
in part refer to G. sulcata, it being impossible to distinguish this species 
from C. alba, except by the fruit and foliage, and some of the measure- 
ments were taken in winter. 

Flowers April 15 to 20, leafing from the 10th to the 13th of the same 
month.

The so-called C. microcarpa, which may be a distinct species, is also 
found. Dr. Schneck, in his catalogue (p. 500), says: "Heavy damp 
soil, scarce. Has very little loose bark, one of our smallest hickories." 
One specimen, however, of what was apparently this form, measured 14 
leet in girth and was considerably over 100 feet high. 

57. (199.) Carya amara. Swamp Hickory ; White Hickory. 

Not uncommon in the bottoms, growing tall and slender, being occa- 
sionally 100 feet or more high and 3 feet in diameter. The largest 
measured was 11 feet iu circumference ; another was 113 feet high and 
G^ in circumference, the trunk G4 feet. 

58. ( .) Carya olivcvformis. Pecan (pronounced Pe-caimi'). 

Common iu rich bottom lands. This is by far the largest of the hick- 
ories, being, in truth, one of the very largest trees of the forest. With 
the single exception of the White Elm the Pecan tree has, in proportion 
to its size, the most widely-expanded head of any tree, while in altitude 
and majestic appearance the largest and finest elms bear no comparison. 
The domelike head may occasionally be seen reared conspicuously 
above the surrounding tree-tops, even in a very lofty forest, some trees 
being as much as 175 feet high (by actual measurement) and with an 



78 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

ambitus of 100 feet or more. The trunk, like tliat of the shell-bark hick- 
ories (C. alba and C. sulcata), is very long, often measuring more than 
50 feet, and occasionally 80 or even 90 feet, to the first limb. A very 
large tree of this species, cut down in the " Timber Settlement," Wabash 
County, and measured by Dr. Schneck, was found to be 175 feet high, 
with a clear trunk 90 feet long and 10 in circumference. Another still 
standing, only fifteen yards distant, had exactly the same circumference, 
and apparently agreed very closely in other measurements. A very 
fine tree in the White River bottoms of Gibson County, Indiana, was 30 
feet in circumference at the ground and 18.} feet around above the 
swollen base; the column-like trunk was more than 50 feet to the first 
limb, while the lofty top spread 100 feet. Near Sandborn, in Knox 
County, Indiana, according to Professor Collett (Cox's Geological Sur- 
vey of Indiana., 1873, p. 364), there is a tree of this species measuring 8 
feet in diameter, but its height is not stated. 

59. (202.) Carya porcina. '< Pig-nut"; " Broom Hickory." 
Common, usually in upland woods. No measurements. 

60. (203.) Carya sulcata. ''Big Shell-bark"; "Bottoms Shell-bark." 

A Very common tree in rich bottom lands, where, growing to a large 
size, and in the character of its bark, as well as in general appearance, 
exactly resembling C. alba. For this reason it is possible that some of 
the measurements given under 0. alba may be intended for the present 
species. 

61. (204.) Carya tomcntosa. "Black Hickory"; " White-heart Hickory"; 
"Bull-nut." 

A very common tree in upland woods, growing frequently more than 
100 feet high and 3 feet or more in diameter, one specimen measuring 
1 12 feet in length, lOJ in circumference, the trunk 55 feet. 

62. (207.) Quercus alba. White Oak. 

Perhaps the most abundant and generally distributed of all our trees, 
growing to a large size, especially in the bottoms, where trees of this 
species 130 feet or more in height and 3 feet in diameter are not uncom- 
mon. Indeed, even in upland woods, the average height of the larger 
White Oaks is 100 feet or more. Ten trees, cut for rails, on one piece 
of ground, averaged as follows: Total length, 100.05 feet; trunk, 40.1 
feet ; diameter (across top of stump), 2| feet. All but one grew on high 
ground. The extremes of size were: height, 87 to 111 feet; trunk, 26 
to 54 feet ; diameter, 2 feet 3 inches to 3 feet. One, measuring 2 feet 4 
inches in diameter and 98 feet in height, exhibited 190 annual rings of 
growth. All but one were perfectly solid, and the one exception was 
hollow only in the stump, the first cut being sound. The tallest and 
largest tree grew at the edge of the creek bottoms, its height being 111, 
trunk 54, and diameter 3 feet. In rich bottom lands the size averages 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. id 

considerably greater, or about 120 feet in height by 3^ to 4 in diameter, 
very large trees having an ambitus of 75 to 95 feet. The following meas- 
urements show pretty well the difference in size between trees growing 
in rich bottoms and those growing in the drier upland woods :

The White Oak begins to leaf, near Mount Carmel, about the 12th of 
April. 

63. (209.) Quercus hicolor. Swamp White Oak. 

A very common, or in some places abundant, tree, fully equal to Q. 
alba in size, but more resembling in form Q. macrocarpa. Only two speci- 
mens have been measured ; one of these, a somewhat decayed prostrate 
one, measured 4 feet 8 inches across the top of the stump (not including 
the bark), the trunk 67 feet to the first limb ; the topmost branches were 
gone, but at 100 feet from the base the five limbs were 10 inches to 1 foot 
in diameter, so that the tree when standing must have been 130 feet or 



80 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

more liigii. The extreme base was hollow. The other was a standing 
tree, measuring 15J feet girth at four feet from the ground, the trunk 
about 20 feet, and the total height 100 feet or more. The top was widely 
spreading, probablj' measuring nearly or quite 100 feet ambitus. 

64. (213.) Quercm coccinea. Scarlet Oak; "Black Oak" (!). 

This tree is apparently not popularly distinguished from Q. tinctoria. 
Dr. Schueclr, in his catalogue, gives the maxinuim measurements of this 
species as 20 J feet girth, 04 feet trunk, and 181 feet total height. I am 
unable to give measurements of my own, however. It is apparently our 
tallest oak, though I had supposed Q. rubra to be entitled to this dis- 
tinction. 

65. (218.) Quercus falcafa. Spanish Oak. 

Common, along with Q. nigra and Q. im1)ri<;aria, in poor soils. Very 
rare in rich grounds, only one tree being seen in the bottoms; this a very 
large one near White River, in Gibson County. It measured 14 feet in 
circumference, and was estimated to be 130 feet high, with a crooked 
trunk of 60 to 70 feet clear. The bark was remarkably light colored, 
appearing almost as pale as some of the white oak section, but the 
leaves, a number of which were obtained (the date being November 2, 
and the ground beneath the tree covered with them, while many, still 
adhering to the branches, aftbrded proof that those on the ground were 
from the same tree), were unquestionably those of Q.falcata. A pho- 
tograph of this tree is in my possession, and sj)ecimens of the leaves 
were deposited in the herbarium of the Agricultural Department. As 
usually found growing, however, in drier and poorer soils, this oak is 
by no means a large tree, seldom exceeding 80 feet in height, and prob- 
ably not averaging over 50 or 60 feet, with a diameter of 1 to 2 feet. 

66. (222.) Quercus imbricaria. Laurel Oak; Shingle Oak. 

With possibly the exception of Q. alba, this is the most abundant and 
generally distributed species, at least in Wabash County. It is the 
most slender of all the oaks, and in some rich bottoms trees 100 feet in 
height and 50 feet to the limbs are only 6 to 7 feet in girth ; one tree, 
however, measuring nearly 4 feet in diameter (11 feet in circumference) 
and over 100 feet high, has been measured. The largest prostrate tree 
measured was 100 feet long, 50 feet to the first limb, and 6J feet in 
girth. It is only in very rich lands, however, that this species attains 
such large dimensions, and on poorer soils, where it is more abundant, 
it does not usually much exceed half this size. 

Flowers May 9 to 12, leafing about the 2d or 3d of the same month. 

67. (226). Quercus lyrata. Overcup Oak ; Swamp Post Oak. 

Not uncommon in some places, but very local — more so, indeed, than 
any other of our oaks. It is confined almost entirely to the low " swales " 
or depressions in the bottom lands, where the ground is either often over-

flowed or very wet for the greater part of the year, and in snch places 
is found along with the " swell-butt" ashes (^rcfj^tmts amencana ) and 
other swamp trees. In general apjjearance it very closely resembles 
the Swamp White Oak [Q. bicolor), branching, like that species, com- 
paratively near the ground, the lower branches drooping so. as to often 
touch the ground at their extremities. It is a smaller tree, however, 
no specimens exceeding 80 feet high and 2^ in diameter having been 
noticed, though, like other species, it may occasionally much exceed its 
usual size. 

68. (227.) Quercus macrocarpa. Bur Oak. 

Very common in rich bottom lands. Much the largest, thongh not 
the tallest of all our oaks, being frequently 5 to 6, sometimes 7, feet 



more. Dr. Schneck gives the maximum dimensious of the Bur Oak as 
follows: Circumference, 22; clear trunk, 72; total height, 165. Trees 
of this size are exceedingly rare, however, if not wholly exceptional. 
The largest that I have measured was 124 feet long to where the top 
branches had been broken oft", the trunk 63 feet in the clear and 21 feet 
in circumference, the measurements, in the same order, of the next 
largest being 162, 30, and 20 feet. A standing tree more than 5 feet in 
diameter (16 feet circumference) had an ambitus of 130 feet in one direc- 
tion and 134 feet the opposite way. 

Following are the measurements that I have taken of this tree, in- 
cluding several by Mr. Thos. J. Johnston and Dr. Schneck:

60, ( .) Quercus michauxi f 

To this species I refer provisionally an oak which is not a common 
species in the vicinity of Mount Carmel (the only place I have seen it), 
but which grows sparingly in rich alluvial soils. So far as I have ob- 
served, it is rather a small species, resembling in general appearance the 
(}. muhlenhergi more than any other of our oaks, but having very difierent 
fruit and foliage. The leaves, 3.25 to 7.00 inches long and 1.50 to 3.50 
Proc. Nat. Mus 82 6 Jtme IS, 1882. 



82 PEOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

wide, are obovate, acute at each end, long petioled (petiole .70 to 1.50 
long), coriaceous^ vert/ glossy above, pale and very velvety beneath, the mar- 
gin deei)lv cnspidate-toothed. The acorn is very hirge (.90 to 1.00 inch 
long by the same in breadth), broadest at the base, the summit some- 
what depressed, the color a rich leather-brown ; cup saucer-shaped, 
flattish beneath, very thicli, velv^ety inside, rouf^hly clad exteriorly with 
very distinct and prominent claw like, somewhat carinate scales, the 
margin thiu, and turned slightly outward ; peduncle very short (.30 or 
less) or wanting, the acorn being usually sessile. This tree can hardly 
be a form of Q. bieolor (to which Q. michauxi is referred by Dr. Eugle- 
mann), its principal characters being directly the reverse of those of 
that species. Thus, the leaves of Q. bieolor are very short-petioled or 
almost sessile, while those of the present species have the petiole an 
inch or more, frequently an inch and a half in length ; in Q. bieolor the 
acorn is attached to a longer peduncle than any other of our oaks 
(usually 2 inches or more in length!), while in this species, if present at 
all, it does not exceed .30 of an inch! The acorn of Q. bieolor is also 
very much smaller, and of a totally different character. 
Whatever this species may be, I leave it for botanists to decide.* 

70. (22S.) Quercus miihlenbergi. "Yellow Oak"; "Chinquapin" (!). 
This tine tree is a very common species in the bottom lands as well 

as on rich hillsides. The trunk may be recognized at a distance by its 
thin -scaled, very light-colored bark, and tall slender growth, this oak 
being probably the tallest in proportion to its diameter of any of the 
white-barked species. One felled tree measured 130 feet in length, the 
trunk 40 feet, and the circumference 13 feet; another (a photograph of 
which, taken before the tree was cut, is in my possession) was 122i feet 
long, 73 feet to the first limb and 84 feet to the main fork, the diameter 
across the top of the stump being only 3i feet! A standing tree, whose 
height could not be ascertained, was 14 feet in circumference above the 
spurred base, which, at the ground, measured 10 feet in diameter. 

The acorns of this tree are very small and sweet, much resembling in 
both appearance and taste, and certainly not inferior to, the nuts of 
the Chinquapin ( Castanea pumila), whence the popular name. The wood 
is said to be tougher than that of Q. alba, and is much used by wagon- 
makers. 

71. (229.) Quercus nigra. "Blackjack"; "Jack Oak." 

A very abundant species in poor, sandy soils, growing 30 to 50 feet 
high and 8 inches to 1^ feet diameter, being, perhaps, the smallest of 
all our oaks. Ko actual measurements having been made, it may be 
that the dimensions given above are sometimes exceeded. 

* Since the above was written, Professor Sargent writes me as follows: "This is, no 
doubt, Q. michauxi, and it must tiow be considered a good ^ecies. It is one of the 
most beautiful and useful of the American oaks." 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 83 

72. (231.) Quercus palustris. "Water Oak"; "Turkey Oak." 

A very common species in wet bottoms, distinguished by its compara- 
tively smooth, grayish bark, and usually by the numerous small droop- 
ing branches which grow from the trunk, sometimes to quite near the 
ground. In close woods, however, it frequently has a clean straight 
stem of 50 feet or more, one of 73 feet having been measured. The 
Water Oak is usually 100 to 120 feet high, and 2 to 3 feet in diameter, 
but much larger specimens sometimes occur, trunks even 4 and 5 feet 
through being occasionally met with. But few specimens have been 
measured, as follows :

This species blossoms about the middle of April. 

(?)73. (232.) Quercus pJiellos. Willow Oak. 

This species I give with some doubt, not beiug quite positive that it 
occurs. I have seen, however, along the road between Mount Carmel 
and Olney (Kichland County) several trees which, at the time of inspec- 
tion, I unhesitatingly decided to be Q. pheUos (a tree with which, as 
growing in Maryland and Virginia, I was perfectly familiar), but not 
having seen it since, while Dr. Schneck has not recorded it, I place the 
interrogation mark as above. 

74. (234.) Quercus rubra. Eed Oak; "Spanish Oak"; "Turkey Oak." 
With the possible exception of Q. coccinea, this is the tallest oak 
growing in the district under consideration, and, excepting Q. macro- 
carpa, is the largest also. Trunks, straight as an arrow, of 5 or even 6 
feet diameter (above the spurs), and 50 to more than 70 feet clear, were 
formerly not at all rare, but at the present time most of them have been 
cut for barrel-staves or clap-boards. The largest Red Oak which I have 
measured was 23 feet in girth (round the top of the stump), the trunk 
7G feet long and 3 feet in diameter at the small end. The top branches 
beyond 120 feet from the base were destroyed, but at this point the sev- 
eral main limbs were a foot in thickness. Another tree, measuring 19 
feet in girth and 71 feet to the first limb, was 150 feet long. At the 
ground these large Eed Oaks measure much more than they do a few 
feet up, on account of the projecting spurs, or buttresses, which, as in 
the White Elm ( Uhnus americana), are a very characteristic feature of 
the species. Thus, a Red Oak measuring 6 feet through at two yards 
from the ground may be 12 feet or more in diameter at the base. 
Flowers April 18 to 20, and leafs out a few days later.

2 to 3 feet in diameter. Larger trees, however, no doubt occur. 

76. (236.) Quercus tinctoria. Black Oak. 

A very common, large tree, chiefly in upland woods. Frequently 100 
feet or more in height, and 3 feet in diameter. It is occasionally larger, 
however, as may be seen from the annexed measurements.

growing wild between Loogootee and Shoals, in Martin County, the 
secoud comity east of Knox. In Jackson and other counties in the 
southern and southeastern part of the State it is abundant, and grows 
to a large size, a specimen near Seymour, being menfioned in Case'ft Bo- 
tanical Index, which measured 22 feet in circumference 2 feet from the 
grouud, and 70 feet to the first limb. 

A few trees, raised from imported seed, are to be found in various 
parts of Wabash County, where they grow finely, and under proper 
conditions, fruit plentifully. Trees near Mount Carmel flower about 
^larch 20, and begin to leaf about the middle of April. 

78. (243.) Fagus ferruginea. Beech. 

I have never seen, nor, indeed, heard of a single beech tree growing 
on the Illinois side of the Wabash ; but immediately across the river, in 
Knox County, Indiana, a few large trees begin to occur, whilt- back on 
the hills of both that county and Gibson it is a very common tree. Trees 
of 3 to 4 feet diameter are not uncommon, while Dr. Schneck records 
one which measured 122 feet in height. Ordinarily, however, the finest 
beech trees are decidedly inferior in altitude to the surrounding oak, 
gum, and other tall forest trees, and 1 should estimate their average 
height at not more than 90 feet. 

79. (244.) Ostrija virginica. Hop Hornbeam. 

By no means a common tree, but occasionally found, and possibly 
more numerous in some localities not visited. No measurements. 

80. (245.) Carpinus caroUniana. "Blue Beech"; "W^ater Beech." 
Very common in rich bottom lands. The largest trees measured were 

30 to 32 feet high, and 1 to IJ feet in diameter, but larger ones may 
occur. Only four trees were measured, their dimensions being as 
follows:

85. (261.) Salix nigra. Black Willow. 

Much the most abundant and also by far the largest of our native 
willows. In some swamps the trees of this species average 60 to 70 
feet high and more than a foot in diameter, while trees considerably 
larger are occasionally met with. Two trees growing on the border 
of Monteur's Pond, in Knox County, Indiana, measured, respectively, 
80 and 87^ feet in length, the latter being more than 3 feet in diameter 
(10 in girth), the former 7^ feet in circumference, and 18J feet to the 
hrst limb. One cut expressly for measurement, near the mouth of 
Crawfish Creek (Wabash County, Illinois), was 77 feet long, 55 feet to 
the first limb, and only 2^ feet around ! Two other trees, measuring re- 
spectively 8^ and 9 feet in girth, were also measured, the former being 
30 feet to the first limb.

Very common about the borders of swamps, usually associated with 
the Black Willow {Salix nigra). Much inferior in size to P. monilifera, 
the largest trees scarcely exceeding 90 feet in height and 2 to 2^ in 
diameter. The trunk, however, is usually very long in proportion, fre- 
quently occupying two-thirds or more of the total length. Only three 
trees of this species have been actually measured, the following being 
their dimensions:

A very common tree in rich bottom lands and along the alluvial banks

Trees of 5 to 6 feet diameter are not uncommon, while trunks of 7 or even 
8 feet are occasionally to be met with; the stem being usually more 
than 50 feet clear. The total height of the tallest cottonwoods is gen-

Remarks.—;/', a very fine tree, formerly standing on the commons 
within the corporation limits of Mount Carmel, but destroyed by the 
tornado of June 4, 1877; height measured by its shadow, the result 
verified by subsequent tape-line measurement; g, i, three majestic trees 
standing near together on the bank of a bayou opposite Rochester, the 
gradually tapering trunks estimated to be 70 to 80 feet clear, the total 
height of the tree is nearly 150 feet. In the immediate vicinity many 
others nearly as large (5 to 6 feet through). 

88. (268.) Populus tremuloides. Aspen; "Quaking Asp." 

A very rare tree in upland woods of Wabash County, but co nmon in 
both uplands and bottoms near Monteur's Pond, in Knox County, Indi- 
ana, where it forms a small slender tree, 50 to 70 feet high and (5 inches 
to a little over a foot in diameter. Only two trees were measured, one, 
blown over by the wind, but still growing, being 71 feet long and 1 foot 
2 inches in diameter; the other, cut for measurement, being 51i feet 
long, though only 14 inches in circumference at the base, and measuring 
24 feet to the first limb. 

89. (277.) Juniperus virginiana. Red Cedar. 

Not native, so far as known, in any i)art of Wabash County, nor ad- 
joining counties in Indiana, the soil being everywhere far too rich for it. 
It is abundant, however, on the hills of Gallatin County, near the mouth 
of the Wabash. The miniature J. communis is found sparingly in Wa- 
bash and adjoining counties, but becomes only a small bush in stature.

the mouth of the Wabash River." (Schneck.) Not seen by me; 
no measurements. 

91. (287.) Taxodium distichum. Bald Cypress; "Cypress." 

I have never heard of any cypress growing anywhere on the Illinois side 
of the Wabash, but in the lower part of Knox County, Indiana, or that 
portion embraced between the Wabash and White Rivers, and known as 
" The Neck," it is very abundant, the area embraced by the cypress 
swamps of that district, and largely timbered with cypress, being esti- 
mated at 20,000 acres (see Cox's Geological Survey of Indiana, 1873, p. 
338). The cypress swamps of this region comprise two quite distinct

tracts, of whicli tlie northern is very much the larger, it« natural outlet 
Iteing the river Deshee, whicli empties into the Wabash between Mount 
Carmel and Vincennes. The "Little Cypress Swamp" is situated im- 
mediately above the mouth of White Eiver, into whicli it empties 
through what is termed the " White River Slough." Although known 
as the ''Cy])ress Swamp," it consists of a series of beautiful, secluded 
l)onds, hidden in the dense forest, and difticult of access by any one not 
familiar with the locality. The principal ponds are the Cypress, Beaver- 
dam, Washburne's, and Forked Ponds, of which Washburne's is perhaps 
the largest. The cyi)reNS trees here grow chiefly around the borders of 
these [)onds and along the sloughs connecting them, as well as the one 
which empties into the river. Being so near the river, into which the 
logs are floated at " high water," the finest trees have long since been 
destroyed, and there are very few left whose symmetry is not marred 
by low-growing branches or knots upon the trunks. The largest stand- 
ing tree observed t>y me was a very old and exceedingly rough speci- 
men, entirely unfit for lumber or shingles. The swollen base measured 
45 feet in circumference at the ground, tlie girth immediately above the 
conical portion being 21 feet; the trunk consisted of several upright 
stems grown together for the greater part of their length, but in places 
distinct, with one very conspicuous transverse growth joining the two 
main stems, at a height of about 50 feet from the ground. The top ex- 
panded 94 feet, the greater part of it elevated over 100 feet from the 
ground. A solid stump, measuring 38 feet around at the ground, was 22 
feet in girth at 8 feet; at about 15 feet it divided into two main trunks 
of equal size, which were cut off immediately above the fork, a" scaffold 
being necessary for the purpose. Another stump was 13 feet in diame- 
ter across the top, but was hollow, and from its decaying wood grew 
several tall, but slender, birch trees, some of which were 50 feet high. 
Several other stumps of 9 and 10 feet in diameter (across the top) were 
measured. Several single, solid trunks of 50 to 92 feet in the clear were 
measured, their diameter at the base being 3 to 5 feet, while the largest 
one measured, a standing tree, was 27 feet in girth above the swollen 
base. The tallest ot these trees did not, however, much exceed 140 feet 
(the two tallest measured being 140 and 147 feet), their average height 
being little, if any, over 100 feet; and even the finest of them would not 
compare for symmetry and length with the Sweet.Gums and Ashes with 
which they were associated. 

92. (324.) rinmmitisf Yellow Pine. 

For obvious reasons there are no pines growing native in Wabash or 
adjoining counties of Illinois or Indiana; but, according to Dr. Schneck 
(catalogue, p. 502), the Yellow Pine occurs on the "hills near the mouth 
of the Wabash River, in Gallatin County, Illinois," Professor Sargent, 
however, suggests that the pine of Southern Illinois may be P. inops. 
which "is common and reaches its best development on the 'Knobs' of 
Southeastern Indiana."

IVOTES ON FISHES COt,T.ECTEI> BY CAPT. CIIAS. I5KI\I>IRE. U. S. A., 
IIV WASBIlI\«r©i'V TERBITOKY Ai-VO OREGON, MAY TO OCTOBER, 
1881. 

By TAKLETON H. BEAN. 

Tbe Uuited States Natioual Museum has again received from Captain 
Bendire a consignment of alcoholic fishes secured by him last summer 
and fall. A large collection previously sent by the captain was only 
partially examined and reported on in the summer of 1881*; the greater 
portion of the fishes are yet to be studied. 

The lot just received includes eleven species, nearly all of which are 
well represented by individuals, giving opportunity for comparison of 
forms which are mostly rare in museums. Captain Bendire's field notes 
are included in the remarks upon the species to which they apply. 

I think there is no reasonable doubt that the material thus brought 
together will enable us to prove the identity of Coregonus Couesii with 
C. WiUiamsonii, and to make, eventually, a consolidation of several spe- 
cies of Apocope. 

The following is a list of the species : 

1. TJranidea marginata. 7. Apocope nnbila. 

2. Coregonus WilJiamsoniL 8. Mylochilus caurinus. 

3. Oncorhyncus chouicha. 9. Richardsonius balteatus.

hooked, and with a very narrow groove beneath the hook. 



92 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The examples sent by Capt. Bendire show the following characters : 
Greatest height of body slightly exceeds length of head, 4^ in length to 
end of scales ; upper jaw as in the above ; eye 4^ in head ; snout 3^ in 
head ; pectoral 5, ventral in length to end of scales ; longest dorsal 
and anal rays as in last; ventral reaches to anal; 1). 9; A. 7 ; V. 7; 
scales 12 to 13-55 to 30-10 to 12 ; length 3 to 3;^ inches ; teeth 2, 4-4, 2. 

These specimens show consklerable variation in the number of scales 
in the lateral line, and there is constantly one more dorsal ray than in 
the types of A. nuMla; they are, however, certainly not si)ecitically dis- 
tinct from Girard's form. 

I have exai]iined a fish collected by Prof Jordan in Utah Lake and 
correctly identified by him with Apocope vulnerata Cope. While the 
teeth of one side of the si)ecimen identified by Prof. Jordan are 1, 4, as 
he states, on the other side of the same fish I find 2, 4. If this condi- 
tion occurs frequently the margin of separation between A. vulnerata and 
A. nubila will become uncomfortably small, as there will be little left 
besides the slightly greater number of scales.

that of the ventrals, about midway between the tip of the snout and the 
end of the middle caudal rays. Length 81 millimeters. 

Color of the alcoholic specimen grayish olive. There is a faint indi- 
cation of a dark stripe oa the nose.

While it is certain that the persistent pharyngeal teeth are as stated, 
I must note that a small tooth was found loose in the tissues covering 
the dentigerous bones. It may be that this fish had the normal num- 
ber and two of them were displaced by accident. Four of the teeth of 
each side are molar-like.

"Lamprey eel." dumber 347 is 19 inches long; number 351 is almost 
exactly as long. The teeth are as in llichardson's description in Fauna 
Boreali- Americana; the dorsals, however, are separated simply by a 
deep emargination ; the base of the first is from one-half to two-thirds 
as long as that of the second; the second dorsal is higher than the first, 
and is subcontinuous with the caudal. The length of the space occupied 
by the giil-openings is contained Sh times in total length, and is a little 
more than the length of the head from end of snout to first gill-open- 
ing. Greatest height of body C in distance from snout to first dor.sal. 

I have compared the type of Fctromyzon astori Grd. with Lampetra 
tridentata and find that they are certainly identical, as already pointed 
out by Professor Jordan. The types of P. ciliatus and P. Ikndus have 
the dorsals separated by a space nearly or quite half as long as the 
first dorsal, but otherwise they have the characters of tridentata.

1 am in doubt whether or not this small lamprey, 4f inches long, is 
the larval form of the above-named species or not. The maxillai-y plate 
is bicuspid, the cusps well se]xirated; the mandibulary plate has 7 teeth 
of uniform size. I am unable to determine the structure of the other 
teeth. The lii)s are fringed. Head 8i in length, equal to space occu- 
pied by gill-openings. Dorsals subcontinuous. Height of body almost 
equal to head. Perhaps this is Ammoca'tes eibariusGiravd, and may be 
distinct from A. plumhea.

[Extract from the Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey for 1882, by permission of 

the Director. | 

Notwitbstauding the large number of specific and generic forms of 
fossil mollusca that have been obtained from the Laramie and fresh- 
water Eocene groups of Western North America, every fresh examina- 
tion of those deposits in any region in which they occur is sure to add 
somethiug to our knowledge of the fiiuna? which respectively charac- 
terize them. While studying tbe Laramie Group in Northeastern Col- 
orado during the season of 1881, I obtained no less than four new 
species, and extended the known geographical range of several others. 
Besides the new forms just mentioned I have recognized two others 
among collections made by other i)ersoiis that have been in tbe National 
Museum for several years past. All of these new forms are described 
in the following paragraphs ; aiul remarks are made upon other forms 
concerning which new facts have been discovered. These descriptions 
are also to appear in the Annual Report of the United States Geologi- 
cal Survey for 1882, in a " Review of tbe Non-Marine Fossil Mollusca 
of North America." 

Genus UNIO Retzius. 

Unio clinopisthus (:*^). uov.), Plate III, tigs. 1 and 2. 

Shell transversely elongate, short in front of the beaks, elongate and 
narrowing behind them to the posterior end ; basal margin having a 
gentle sinuosity, there being a slight emargination just behind tbe mid- 
length ; front margin regularly rounded ; dorsal margin i)roper rather 
short; postero-dorsal margin forming a long, convex, downward slope 
from the dorsal to the postero-basal margin, which latter margin is nar- 
rowly rounded ; beaks depressed and ])laced near the i'ront of tbe shell. 
A somewhat prominent, but not sharply defined, umbonal ridge extends 
from the beak of each valve to the postero-basal margin, giving a flat- 
tened space at the postero-dor.sal poi tion of each valve. Surface marked 
only by concentric lines of growth. 

Length, 63 millimeters ; height, 30 millimeters ; thickness, both valves 
together, 23 millimeters. (Museum No. 8359.) 

Position and locality. — Strata of the Green River Eocene group near 
Washakie Station, in Southern Wyoming, where it was collected by Dr. 
Havden. 

Genus CORBiCULA Miihlfeldt. 

Corbicula berthoiidi (sp. uov.), Plate IV, tigs. 1, 2, and 3. 

Shell very large, subtrigonal in marginal outline, moderately gibbous; 
front concave immediately in front of the breaks; front margin regu-

larly ronndecl; basal margin broadly rounded; postero-basal margin ab- 
ruptly rounded uj) to the postero-dorsal margin, whicli latter margin 
slopes oblifpiely downward with a gentle convexity from between the 
beaks ; hinge strong ; all the teeth well developed, the lateral ones es- 
pecially being long and large and crenulated upon their edges as is usual 
with all the known species of Corhicula of the Laramie Group ; muscu- 
lar and pallial impressions having the usual characteristics ; surface 
marked with the usual concentric lines. 

Length of one of the largest examples in the collections, 62 millime- 
ters ; height from base to umbo, 54 millimeters ; thickness, both valves 
together, 44 millimeters. 

This fine large species, the largest yet known in IsTorth America, has 
been found only in the Laramie ^strata east of the Eocky Mountains in 
Colorado. It is named in honor of Capt. E. L. Berthoud, the first dis- 
coverer of the rich shell deposits of the Laramie Group in that region. 
(Museum No. 11556.) 

Position and locality. — Laramie Group; valley of South Platte Eiver; 
Northeastern Colorado. 

Corbicula augheyi (sp. nov.), Plate IV, figs. 4, 5, and 6. 

Shell moderately large, subtetrahedral in marginal outline, postero- 
dorsal region not flattened, as in 0. herthondi; umbones full, rounded, 
considerably elevated above the hinge line, front regularly rounded; 
basal margin broadly convex; posterior end truncnted, the direction of 
the truncated margin usually a little backward of a line drawn perpen- 
dicularly with the base of the shell; postero dorsal margin a little con- 
vex; hinge well developed; muscular and pallial markings of the usual 
character; surface marked by the usual concentric line of growth, and 
usually by very faint umboual ridges extending from the umbo to the 
postero-dorsal and postero basal margins respectively. 

Length of an adult example, 46 millimeters; height from base to um- 
bones, 38 millimeters; thickness, both valves together, 30 millimeters. 

This species has yet been foun"" only in the valley of South Platte 
Eiver, in Northern Colorado, east of the Eocky Mountains. It is named 
in honor of Prof. Sainuel Aughey, of Nebraska State University, who 
assisted me in the collection of the type specimens. (^Museum No. 
11557.) 

Position and locality. — Laramie Group; valley of South Platte Eiver; 
Northeastern Colorado; associated with the preceding. 

Genus NERITINA Lamarck. 
Neritina bruneri (sp. nov.), Plate IV, figs. 7 anil 8. 

Shell subglobose; volutions about four; spire much depressed; suture 
moderately distinct; inner lip broad, its inner edge a little irregular. 
Surface of adult examples marked by numerous raised revolving lines, 
which are crossed by strong, dark, zigzag color-markings. Upon young 



96 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

examples tbe revolving lines are absent, or nearly so, and the color- 
markings are less distinctly zigzag in their direction. 

Axial length, 10 millimeters; transverse diameter, 13 millimeters. 

The specific name is given in honor of Mr. Lawrence Bruner, who first 
discovered the species. It differs from N. volvilhieata White, in being 
somewhat more globose, having a less elevated spire, and the inner lips 
broader and less retreating. It is marked by revolving lines, somewhat 
like that species, but they are sometimes obsolete. It is also orna- 
mented by zigzag color-markings. The type specimen is represented 
by figs. 7 and 8 on Plate IV. 

Associated with the foregoing is still another form, much smaller, 
which seems to be the young of ])f. volvilincata. It is without color- 
markings, and the inner border of the inner lip is dentate. 

Position and locality. — Laramie Group; valley of South Platte Eiver, 
Northeastern Colorado, where it is associated with the two last- described 
species. 

Genus MELAXOPSIS Lamarck. 

Melanopsis americana (sp. uov. ), Plate IV, figs. 9 and 10. 

Shell very small, sides straight, and meeting at the apex at an acute 
angle; volutions .six or seven, those of the spire not convex, but so flat- 
tened as to show only a linear suture between them, which is somewhat 
irregular; proximal portion of the last volution gently convex, its length 
being more than half che entire length of the shell; outer lip thin, not 
expanded, its margin not distinctly sinuous; inner lip having a very 
strong callus nearly filling the distal end of the aperture, leaving a 
narrow groove between it and the margin of the outer lip, and grad- 
ually diminishing in thickness towards the proximal end of the aper- 
ture; aperture, as bounded by the outer lip and callous inner lip, rudely 
subelliptical, angular at its distal end, rounded at its ])roxiinal end, and 
terminating at the end of the columella in a distinct, narrow canal, 
which is slightly bent to the left. Surface marked only by faint lines 
of growth. 

Length, 7 millimeters; diameter of last volution, 3h millimeters. 
(Museum No. 11559.) 

If we except the species wliich were published by Conrad under the 
generic name of BuUio2)sis, but which probably belong to the genus 
Melanopsis., no species of the latter genus have hitherto been known in 
North America, either fossil or living. Tbe s])ecies which is here de- 
scribed is plainly congeneric with the living Melanopsis costcllata Fe- 
russac, and with the Eocene M. buccinoidea Ferussac, both of Western 
Europe. 

Position and locitlity.—haY-dmie Group, Valley of South Platte Eiver, 
Northeastern Colorado, where it is associated with the three last de- 
scribed forms, and also with Corbtfla, Melunia, Anomia, and Osirea. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 97 
Geuus CAMPELO:\rA Eafiiiesque. 

Campeloma prodticta (sp. nov.), Plate III, figs. 7, 8, and 9. 

Shell, elongate-ovate; test, uioderately tbick; spire, more than nsnally 
produced for a species of this geuus; volutions, six or seveu, usually 
slightly flattened, or having a faint revolving <lepression upon the dis- 
tal side near the suture, which is more apparent upon the larger than 
the smaller volutions; suture, deep and abrupt upon the proximal side: 
aperture and lips having the usual characteristics of Campeloma; sur- 
tace marked by the usual lines of growth, and by somewhat numerous 
revolving stride which are often obscure. Among these examples are 
others which possess the general characteristics of those Avhich are re- 
garded as the types; but two or three of the revolving striic upon th(^ 
smaller volutions of these examples are much more prominent than in 
the case of typical examples. I at present, however, regard these as 
only varieties of a very variable species. 

Length of aji example regarded as typical, 32 millimeters ; breadth of 
the last volution, 14 millimeters; but some examples, evidently referable 
to the typical forms, are pro]»ortionally less elongate. (Museum No. 
8140.) 

Position and locality. — Laramie strata in the Valley of Yellowstone 
River, Montana, where they were collected several years ago by Mr. J. 
A. Allen. 

The under valve of Anomia micronema JlFeel'. 

It has been the subject of frequent remark that not a single example 
of the under valve of either of the two species of Anomia^ A. micnmemef 
and A. (jryphorhynclms Meek, both of the Laramie Group, has ever been 
discovered, althougli hundreds of examples of the upper valves of troth 
of these species have been obtained, at many different localities, in a 
good state of preservation. I was lately so fortunate, however,, as to tind 
in the Laramie strata of Northeastern Colorado several examples of the 
under valve of A. micro7iema^ one of which is illustrated by fig. 3, 
Plate 111. That the under, or byssus-beariug, valves of A. mieronema at 
least have been so generally destroyed is due to the f}»ct, first, of their 
extreme thinness, and, secondly, to the fact that, with the exception of 
a thin, porcelanous layer in the middle portion, the whole valve is^ com- 
posed of a prismatic layer, like the shell of Pinna ; the pearly layer, 
which gis^es such strength to the upper valve, being apparently entirely 
wanting in the lower. This prismatic layer breaks up into its compo- 
nent prisms with great facility. The characteristics of the under valve 
of A. mieronema, as well as those of the upper valve, show it to be a 
true Anomia ; thus presenting evidence of the great antiquity Osf the 
genus essentially as it exists to-day. 

Both valves of recent species of Anomia have, as a covering toithe 
pearly layer, a very thin prismatic layer, which is often obsolete. This 
layer is also sometimes distinguishable upon the upper valvef? ©#' these

fossil species. The latter seem to differ from the sheila of living species 
of Ano)iiia only in the lack of development in the under valve of the 
pearly layer, and the excessive development of the prismatic layer. 

Pyrgulifeba Meel- and Paramelania Smith. 

There occurs somewhat abundantly in the Bear Kiver Laramie beds 
of Southwestern Wyoming and the adjacent parts of Utah a shell which 
Mv. ]\Ieek first referred to Melania, but to which he afterward gave the 
new generic nameotPj/zY/^/i/era, describing it under the name of Pyrgu- 
Ufera humrom.* It is illustrated on Plate III, figs. 10, U, aud 12. Meek 
])laced this shell among the Ceriphasiida? or American Melaniaus, but 
as it seems to differ quite as widely from the typical forms of that fam- 
ily as it does from the true Melaniaus, I have placed it i)rovisionalIy 
with the latter family. It is the only known species of the genus which 
has beeu i)roposed to receive it, either fossil or liviug, if we except the 
two living forms which were described by ]\Ir. Edgar A. Smith from Lake 
Tauganyiki, in Africa,t under the new sub-generic name Paramelania. 
]\Ir. Smith gave these two forms the names P. damoni aud P. cras-si- 
</ranulata, respectively. Copies of his figures of both these forms are 
given on Plate III for comparison. 

ParameJania, as represented both by thesx? figures aud Mr. Smith's 
(^description, seems to be exactly equivalent with Pyrgnlifera Meek. It 
jjts ttrue that we -can never know whether the animal of the latter was 
genferically the same as that of the former, and the wide chronological 
and grgographical separation of the fossil and liviug forms is presumptive 
.evideu<yi€ against their generic identity. But if we are justified iii estab- 
lishing- geszera upon shells alone, as we must do in paleontology, we are 
entjtkd to iiold them as against anything except direct proof of error.

4.-THE HOI.I.USCAIV FAUIVA OF THE TKICKEE OKOUP, IIVCJ.VD^ 
II\G A NEW FOR.Tl. 

By €. A. WHITE. 

lExtracted from the Aunual Report of the United States Geological Survey for 1882, b.y permissiou of 
the Director] ' 

In volume II, Paleontology of California, Mr. Gabb described and 
figured two species of fresh- water fossil niollusca from the valley of Snake 
River, Idaho, which he stated to be of Tertiary age. In volume IV, 
United States Geological Survey of tlie Fortieth Parallel,. IMr. Meek 
described and figured seven other species, one from Soutliwestern Idaho 
and the others from the Kawsoh Mountains, in Northern Nevada. He 
referred these to the Tertiary period, and they evidently came from 
strata that are geologically equivalent witli those which furnished :\rr. 
Gabb's specimens. Mr. King, in volume 1 of tbe last named survey, re- 
ferred these strata to the Miocene epoch of the Tertiary period, and 
gave them the name of Truckee Group. 



100 PROCEEDINGS OF UXITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

While arraiigiug- the fossils of the National Miiseniu, I lately foiuul 
among other undistributed material a small mass of fossiliferons rock, 
which bore the label '-50 miles below Salmon Falls, Snake Kiver/' 

Upon breaking up this mass it was found to contain examples of both 
the S])ecies that were described by Gabb, and also another form that 
has not hitherto been described. This makes ten species of mollusks 
that are now known to exist in that formation. 

Although this fauna, so far as it is now known, is a very meager one, 
it is, nevertheless, ^^ery interesting, because it differs so much from any 
other fresh-water fauna, either fossil or now living, in ISTorth xVmerica. 
Tliis difference is all the more remarkable because the fresh-water faun.'E 
of the Laramie, and the several Eocene groups, all of whiijh are older 
than the Truckee Group, consist largely of types that are now living in 
the Mississippi drainage system. 

Illustrations of all the molluscan species that are yet known to exist 
in the Truckee Group are brought together on Plate V for the purpose 
of ])resenting them all at a single view. All of them, except the four 
figures of Latia daUii, are copies of the original figures pul)lished by 
Meek and Gabb respectively. 

Not deeming it necessary to repeat the descriptions of the species that 
have already been published, the new form only will be herein de- 
scribed. 

The names of the others, however, are given in the following para- 
graphs, together with references to the resi)ecti\ e works in which the 
species were originally described.

snuill closely incurved l>eak which is turned a little to the right side, 
and makes about one full volution. Semilunar shelf or septum comi)ara- 
tively large. Surface marked by many strong irregular concentric un-

by fine lines of growth.

The specific name is given in honor of Mr. W. H. Dull, whose iniport- 
fiut works u})on the molhisca are well known. 

This interesting shell seems to agree with the genns Latia Gray iu 
all essential characteristics, so far as they are observable upon the 
specimens that have yet been discovered. The form is Crepidida-lUie, 
the test thill, and the semilunar septum, well developed; but the "pro- 
jecting free lamina" upon the right side of the septum, described by Dr. 
Gray, has not been observed upon our examples. 

Although in form and structure this shell is so much like a Crepidula, 
its fresh-water associations forbid its reference to the Calyptriidie. I 
am not entirely satisfied that it ought to be referred to the Ancylidai, 
but for the present I place it provisionally in that family. 

The fact that this shell is entirely unlike any form that is now known 
in North America, either living or fossil, gives it peculiar interest. This 
interest is also largely iiicreased by the fact that the genus to which it 
is here referred has hitherto been known only in New Zealand or other 
parts of Oceanica, and only in the living state. 

The molluscan fauna, to which this shell belongs is, as a whole, (juite 
unlike any other fresh-water fauna of "North America, either living or 
fossil. The' reason of this difference between the Truckee molluscan 
fauna and that which now characterizes the Mississippi drainage sys- 
tem is doubtless that the outlet of the Truckee lake has had no continu- 
ous connection or identity with the streams that, persisting from Terti- 
ary time and earlier, have become portions of that system. 

The forms among the Truckee fauna that are most nearly like species 
now living in North America are the Aneylns and the two species of 
Splmr'mm just mentioned; and yet the latter present some noteworthy 
differences from any North American congeneric; form either living or 
fossil. It is true there is a species of Carinifex in the Pacific drainage 
waters of California, but its difference from those of the Truckee fauna 
was regarded by Mr. Meek as of subgeueric importan<5e. The three 
forms of Melania and the Lithasia of the foregoing list have no true 
type-representatives, either living or fossil, in North America; and the 
newly discovered form herein described differs still more widely from 
any member of any North American fauna. 

The Truckee Group is understood to have quite a large geographical 
extent in northern Nevada, southwestern Idaho and southeastern Ore- 
gon, but it has .yet received very little investigation as regards its mol- 
luscan fauna. The presence in that group of a molluscan fauna so widely 
differentiated as it is indicated to be by the few species that have hith- 
erto been discovered encourages the hope that large additions to it will 
hereafter be made.

Carcharias fronto, sp. nov. (28lf)7.) 

Allied to Carcharias amblyrhynchus Bleeker, but with much larger 
second dorsal. 

a. Description of No. 28167, a young (female) example, 30 inches in 
leugth: 

Body comparatively short and stout. Head very Inoad, depressed, 
broadly rounded anteriorly, the outline of the snout nearly parallel with 
that of the l>road Y-shaped mouth. Leugth of snout from mouth equal 
to half the distance between the angles of the mouth, or to the distance 
from the line connecting these angles to the chin, about six-sevenths the 
distance between the nostrils. Eye a little nearer nostril than angle of

mouth. Nostril a little nearer eye tlian tip of snout. Interorbital width a 
trifle more than half distance from snout to base of pectoral, about twice 
length of snout, measured from eye. Angle of mouth with a deep pit 
which scarcely extends as a furrow on either lip. Islostrils near margin 
of head, their length half their distance from eye, and about the same 
as length of eye, the anterior margin with a moderate flap. Teeth ot 
both jaws narrowly triangular, more than twice as high as broad, those 
of the upper jaw rather broadest, all of them nearly erect and not evi- 
dently notched on the outer margin. Edges of teeth appearing minutely 
serrulate under a lens. Teeth about |{f. 

Gill-openings rather deep, the last two over the base of the pectorals, 
the depth of them about equal to the distance from nostril to middle of 
eye, the branchial area scarcely longer than broad. 

Free margins of all the tins concave. Insertion of tirst dorsal rather 
nearer pectorals than ventrals, its distance behind pectoral being nearly 
equal to the length of its anterior margin. Anterior lobe, when de- 
pressed, reaching past the base of the tin, but not to the end of the pos- 
terior lobe, which reaches nearly to the base of the ventrals. Length of 
base 01 first dorsal slightly more than its (vertical) height, and notably 
less than interorbital width. Distarice between dorsals slightly more 
than twice the base of first dorsal, a little more than three times base of 
second. 

Second dorsal similar in form to the first dorsal, its base one-fifth 
shorter, its posterior lobe reaching to within an eye's diameter of the 
pit at root of caudal. 

Lower lobe of caudal half length of upper, both of the ordinary form 
in this genus ; length of the upper lobe a little less than the distance 
from snout to posterior part of root of pectorals, a little less than one- 
fourth the total length. 

Anal smaller than second dorsal and proportionately higher, its mar- 
gin deeply concave, its anterior lobe reaching the tip of posterior when 
reflexed ; length of anterior margin about equal to base of second dor- 
sal." Distance of anal from caudal a little more than its base, and a 
little less than distance of front of anal from base of ventials. Middle 
of anal under middle of second dorsal. 

Ventrals moderate, their anterior margins about equal to the distance 
between the angles of the mouth. 

Pectorals rather large, their angles not acute; their tips reaching a 
little past front of dorsal; tlieir anterior margins half longer than inter- 
orbital width, and 2^ tiines the free margin. 

Color uniform slaty-gray; all the fins edged with darker brownish, 
darkest on the lower lobe of the caudal, but nowhere fully black. 

b. Description of a large specimen : 

A large example of this species, some 10 feet in length, was speared 
from the wharf at Mazatlan. The jaws of this specimen (collector's 
number, 907) were taken. 



104 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED .STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Ill this specimeu the teeth of the upper jaw are broadly triauguhir, the 
hreadth of the base being about equal to the vertical height, the iuuer 
margin nearly .straight or slightly convex, the outer margin a little con- 
cave, but not distinctly notched. Edges of upper teeth conspicuously 
serrate, especially towards the base. Median tooth very broad and short, 
serrate, with concave margins. 

Teeth of lower jaw narrowly triangular, with broad bases, which spread 
out abruptly. Edges of lower teeth weakly serrate ; mediau teeth small, 
triangular, entire; middle teeth of sides of each jaw largest. Number 
of teeth about f^. 

The following notes on this specimen were taken by Mr. Gilbert. The 
measurements were taken with">ut instruments as the shark was lying 
on the beach, and are not all entirely accurate: 

Head very heavy and short, the snout exceedingly broad and short; 
its preoral portion much longer, shorter than distance between nostrils, 
and nearly equal to the length between the inner margins of the pectorals. 
Eyes on the depressed margin of the head, the nostrils very close to the 
margin. A short deep fold at angle of mouth, extending a very short 
distance on each lip. 

Gill openings wide, the last two above base of pectorals, the longest 
slit about equal to half base of pectoral. 

Origin of tirst dorsal behind vertical from posterior base of pectoral, 
a distance about equal to a gill-slit, the fin considerably nearer pectorals 
than ventrals. Anterior margin of dorsal two-thirds anterior margin 
of pectorals. Anal inserted slightly behind front of second dorsal and 
somewhat smaJ 
branchial area. 

Pectorals long, not half longer than broad, their anterior margins 
convex; inner margin of pectoral about half longer than a gill-slit; 
about one-third the length of the free edge, which is six-sevenths the an- 
terior edge. 

Ventrals short; length of anterior margin less than one-third the 
length of pectorals, nearer second dorsal than first. Distance from an- 
terior base of ventrals to vertical from tirst dorsal equal to distance of 
the posterior base from anal. A pit above and belowroot of tail. Cau- 
dal with lower lobe half length of upper, the lower lobe broadly scythe- 
shaped. 

This species is rather common about Mazatlan, where it is known as 
Tibtiron. Its liver is valued for the oil it jiroduces. It was not seen 
elsewhere. 

The fresh-water shark of Lake Nicaragua {Eulamia nicaraguensis Gill) 
is closely allied to this species, but apparently distinct. 

Carcharias cethalorus, sp. nov. (2S202, 29549).

Color light slaty-gray ; belly white ; middle line of back posteriorly 
and upper edge of tail blackish; tips of all the fins distinctly blackish, 
es])ecially the pectorals and lower lobe of caudal, 

This species is rather common at Mazatlan, where several young 
specimens were taken, the largest (29549), a young male, being 30 inches 
in length. A species thought to be the same was also seen at Panama, 
but no specimens were brought to the museum.

Body rather slender and elongate, the back little elevated. Head 
depressed, long and narrow, rather pointed anteriorly. Length of snout 
from mouth greater by about the diameter of the eye than the distance 
between the angles of the mouth and a little more than half greater 
than the distance from a line connecting the angles of the mouth to the 
tip of the chin. 

Eye rather large, a little nearer nostril than angle of mouth ; distance 
from eye to nostril scarcely half the distance from nostril to tip of 
snout. 

Interorbital width two-fifths distance from snout to first gill-o])ening, 
somewhat less than length of snout measured from eye. 

Angle of mouth with a i)it from which a furrow extends on the lower 
lip a distance about etjual to the length of a nostril, and on the upper 
lip considerably farther. Length of nostril about two-thirds diameter of 
eye, and about half its distance from eye, the anterior margin with a 
narrow projecting flap. Distance between outer angles of nostrils 
slightly more than their distance from tip of snout. 

Teeth of the upper jaw subtriangular, very oblique, deeply notched 
on the outer margin, those of the lower jaw similar, narrower and rather 
less oblique. Bases of upper teeth with a few weak serrations. Ifo 
evident serrations on enameled parts of any of the teeth. Number of 
teeth about ff. Teeth all somewhat narrower and less oblique than in 
Carcharias {ScoUodon) terra'- nova'. 

Gill openings narrow, the last two over base of pectoral, the depth of 
one about f the distance from snout to mouth, the middle or largest about 
half the length of the branchial area; first and last gill-openings about 
equal. 

Top of head with numerous mucous pores. A series of numerous 
large pores in a line above angle of mouth, and a baud of them behind 
eye, extending upward on the nape. Under side of snout with many

niiuule pores, these formiug an elliptical area on the lower side of snout, 
outside of which on each side is a crescent-shaped area of pores. 

Insertion of first dorsal well behind pectoral, but much nearer to pec- 
toral than ventral; its distance behind posterior base of pectoral Ij in 
preoral part of snout.

posterior lobe; the distance to the base of posterior lobe from ventrals 
nearly half preoral part of snout.

which is 10 times base of second dorsal. 

Second dorsal very small, its free margin scarcely concave ; the pointed 
posterior lobe nearly twice the anterior. 

Caudal, 4J in total length; its lower lobe bluntish, about | the up])er; 
length of caudal equal to distance from snout to base of pectoral. 

Anal fin small, but considerably larger than second dorsal, inserted 
in front of the latter, so that its posterior part is below the insertion of 
the dorsal. Length of anal about equal to its elongate posterior lobe, 
and less than half its distance from the ventrals. Ventrals moderate, 
their anterior margins two-thirds distance between angles of mouth. 

Pectorals rather small, not quite reaching middle of first dorsal, their 
tips bluntish, the length of the anterior margin If times interorbital 
width and 1^ times the free margin. Pectoral scarcely more than one- 
eighth the total length of the fish. 

Color slaty-gray with a distinct bluish tinge ; white below; upper edge 
of tail and tip of caudal dusky ; vertical fins faintly margined with 
dark. 

This species is common in the harbor of Mazatlan, where five s])eci- 
mens were obtained ; the largest of these (28330), a male, 32 inches long, 
is apparently nearly matnre, the claspers reaching the anal. It has 
especially served for the basis of the above description. 

Our specimens agree in most respects with Professor Poey's accounts 
of his Scolioflon porosns from Cuba. If the generic value of the group 
called Scoliodon be not admitted, the latter species must receive a new 
name, as there is already a Cnrcharias porosKs Eanzani. 

Carcharias, sp. incog. 

The jaws of a large shark were obtained at Mazatlan, the species of 
which we have not been able to ascertain. The following is a descrip- 
tion of the teeth : 

Teeth |f. Teeth of the upper jaw rather narrowly triangular, the tip 
rather strongly curved outward;' the inner margin rather strongly con- 
vex, the outer rather strongly concave; the outer margin with a broad, 
shallow basal angle, a continuation of the curve of the outer edge of the 
tooth. Both margins of the teeth strongly serrate, the senxe stronger

on the outer margin towards the base of the tooth. Upper jaw with a 
moderate, trianguUir median tooth, denticuhited like the others. 

Lower teeth very different in form, long, slender, sharp, straight, sub- 
terete, rising from broad roots, somewhat turned outward, but more 
erect than the upper teeth. jS'o distinct notch on outer margin, where 
a slightly obtuse angle is formed. Edges of lower teeth everywhere 
strictly entire. 

Its relations seem to be, so far as can be judged by the teeth, with such 
species as Carcharias fjutjot Bleeker and G. menisorrali Val., members 
of the "genus" Phitypodon Gill. 

Mustelus lunulatus, ap. nov. (29211.)

large, a little nearer angle of mouth than nostril; distance from eye to 
nostril three-fifths distance from nostril to tip of snout, Interorbital 
space narrow, 24 times in distance from snout to first gill-opening, some- 
what less than Jength of snout as measured from eye. Angle of mouth 
with a pit from which furrows extend on each lip for a short distance, 
about equal on each lip and considerably less than length of nostril.

dle of the fin ; distance of insertion of first dorsal from anterior root of 
pectorals about ^ its distance from tip of snout. First dorsal high, its 
anterior lobe when depressed reaching a little past tip of posterior lobe. 
.Length of base of first dorsal about equal to its vertical height, and 
nearly half greater than interorbital width. Distance between dorsals 
2f times base of first and a little more tluiTi 3 times base of second. 
Posterior angle of dorsal produced but not reaching to vertical from 
front of ventrals. Middle of dorsal nearer pectoral base than ventral

DEmCRIPTIOIN OF A IVEW SHARK (CARC IIAKIAiii IiA.lIIEIiL.A) FROm 
.SAIV DIFOO, CALIFORNIA. 

By DAVID S. JORDAI>f and CHARLES H. GILBERT. 

Allied to Carcharias lamia (Risso). 

Body comparatively robust, the back elevated, the greatest depth 
half more than the height of the dorsal liii and equal to the distance 
from the nostril to the gill-openings. 

Head broad and flat, the snout long, but wide and rounded. Length 
of snout from mouth greater than the distance between outer angles of 
nostrils, a little more than width of mouth. Nostrils considerably nearer 
the eye than tip of snout, but nearer snout than angle of mouth. Eyes 
moderate. 

Teeth about f ^, not very large, the upi)er rather narrowly triangular, 
nearly erect, slightly concave on the outer margin, but not notched, 
rather finely serrated everywhere. Lower teeth similar, but consider- 
ably narrower, finely serrated. Middle teeth in both jaws smaller than 
the others. 

A pair of jaws taken from a much larger specimen have, as usual, 
the teeth considerably broader than in the young and more distinctly 
serrate. They are quite similar to the teeth of C. lamia. 

First dorsal beginning at a distance four-fifths the length of its own 
base behind the root of pectorals, and ending at a point somewhat more 
than its own base before the ventrals, its height slightly more than the 
distance from the snout to the posterior margin of the eye, slightly more 
than its base, and considerably less than greatest height of body. Space 
between dorsals equal to the distance from snout to first gill-opening, 
2f times base of first dorsal, 7 times base of second. 

Second dorsal very small, not one-sixth the size of the first and con- 
siderably smaller than the anal, which is deeply emarginate, the two 
fins nearly opposite each other. Ventrals small, nearly midway be- 
tween the two dorsals. Tail long, forming nearly two-sevenths of the 
total length. Pectorals broad and long, not pointed, their tips reach-

a little less than one third the outer, their length 5§ in total. 

Color, plain light gray, white below ; edge of pectorals and caudal 
narrowly dusky. 

A young male specimen of this species (27,366), two feet in length, 
was obtained by us in San Diego Bay, California. It is said to be not 
uncommon along the coast of Lower California and it is known at San 
Diego as " Bay Shark." The jaws of an adult example taken on the 
coast of Lower California were also procured. 

It is evidently closely related to C. lamia, but the smaller dorsal and 
pectorals and the more backward i)osition of the dorsal seem to dis- 
tinguish it sufiticiently. The fins seem to be less falcate than in C. lamia. 

In the Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. ISSl, p. 32, this species is mentioned 
by us under the name of Enlamia lamia. 



CRITIC'AI^ REITIARK)^ OX THE TREK-CREEPEKS (CERTHIA) OF 
EUROPE AND IVORTH Ai^IERICA. 

By ROBERT RIDG^VAY. 

The question of whether the American tree-creeper is separable from 
the European as a distinct race or species has long been a mooted 
point, and one in regard to which there is great difference of opinion 
among writers. Several eminent authorities, both in Europe and Amer- 
ica, consider the European and North American birds of this genus as 
identical, or not separable even as races; but not a few authors, who base 
their conclusions on ample material, and are not iutiuenced by ultra-con- 
servative views regarding geographical variations, agree in recognizing 
two European races or species (according to the individual views of the 
author), one being the true G. famiUaris Linn, of northern Euroi)e, the 
other of more southern range, and variously designated as G. ro.s^rt' Bailly 
or C. trachydactyla Brehm ;* and in considering the common American 
bird as distinct from both the European forms, though some of them 
have referred it to G. cost(e. 

The North American creeper was first separated, as G. amcricana (by 
which name it has been known by American ornithologists up to a com- 
paratively recent date), by Bonaparte in 1838; but having been already 
named many years previously (by Bartram, in 1701, as G. ri(fa, and Barton, 
in 1799, as G.fusca), Bonaparte's name cannot be used. The Mexican 
creeper was also separated in 1834, liy Gloger, as G. mexicana. Thus two 
European and two American races or species of Gerfhia have been 
recognized by many ornithologists of standing. Others, however, pro- 

* It is unnecessary for me to discuss here the question of which of these names 
shouki be adopted: therefore, without inquiring particularly into the case, I adopt 
provisionally the former.

fess an inability to distinguisli between specimens from the two conti- 
nents, and therefore insist upon their identity, althongh some of the 
best anthorities rank G. mcxicana as a distinct species. 

For the pnrpose of carefully reviewing the subject in all its bearings, 
I hare brought together a considerable number of specimens, and after 
a very deliberate comparison of this material (embracing many skins 
not inclnded in the following tables of measurements), and an equally 
careful consideration of all that has been written on the subject, I am 
forced to the conclusion that the G. mexicana itself cannot stand even 
as a race, or else it becomes necessary to recognize a larger nnmber 
of races than have usually been claimed for the species. In other 
"words, it is simply a question of whether geographical variations of 
form and colors are to be completely ignored as a factor in the genesi* 
of species, or whether they should receive due consideration in connec- 
tion with this important subject. Believing the latter view to be the 
more scientific one, and since they are each "associated with definite 
geographical areas," 1 find the following races suscei)tible of definition. 

A. — Primary coverts disfinctly tipped with whitish. 

1. familiaris Linn. (Ijased iipon Scautlinavian speeimeus). 

Of this form I have three examples before me from Bergen, Norway 
(coll. L. Stejneger). These agree in having the lower parts of a brilliant 
silvery white, never seen in American specimens, thongh this pure white 
color is somewhat obscured by a grayish tinge nndoubtedly caused by 
contact with carbonaceous substance upon burnt trees. The cri^snm is 
very faintly tinged with butf ; the lores are either wholly white or else 
merely tinged with dusky in front of the eye; the dark ground color of 
the upper parts is much tinged with yellowish tawny (which prevails on 
the rump), and the maxilla is either very dark brown or black. These 
specimens measure as follows :

3. brittaiiica Subsp. nov. 

Two examples from England differ from all continental specimens 
which I have seen very nearly as much as C. mexlcana does from the 
ordinary North American bird ; and since it would appear from descrip- 
tions that these specimens represent the normal style of coloration of 
specimens from the Bi'itish Islands, I see no alteruative but to charac- 
terize the British specimens as a race always distinguishable from the 
two continental forms. These British examples are very much browner 
above than those from the continent (closely resembliug, in this respect, 
Californian specimens hereinafter described as occidenfaUs), the rump is 
more deeply tawny, aud the lower parts appear to be of a much duller 
white, though this may be owing to a soiling of the plumage. These 
are the specimens which in History of North American Birds (i, pp. 124, 
125) were supposed to be the true C. familiar is, thus leading to the erro- 
neous views of their relationships therein given. TLie measurements 
are as follows, the tail being in both examiiles much worn at the tip, and 
therefore not included :

otlier measurenieuts are on the average quite different. In coloration, 
they most resemble G. cosUv, hut as a rule have the the crissum more 
decidedly buff, and the rump brighter tawny, while the maxilla is never 
light brown, as often occurs in the South-European form. The follow- 
ing measurements are from fully adult birds, in perfect plumage:

5. montana Subsp. vov. 

Middle Province of North America; (uortli to Kadiak, Alaska) breeding south to 
New Mexico and Arizona, in wooded mountains. 

While I have been able to examine a smaller series of this form than 
any other except familiaris proper and byittanica, the six examples in- 
spected show such well-marked peculiarities of form and coloration as 
to leave no doubt of the propriety of separating the Rocky Mountain 
bird as a geographical race. The general tone of coloration is decidedly 
grayer above than in any other form of the species, the flanks are de- 
cidedly grayish, the crissum more pronounced buff than in either of the 
three European races, and the tawny of the rump in more abrupt con- 
trast with the grayish of the back. The most decided differences, how- 
ever, are in proportions: thus, while the wing averages shorter than in 
either Jam 11 iar is or cost(v, the tail is decidedly longer; the bill also aver- 
ages much longer than in famiUaris or cosUc, but is altogether more 
slender, both the vertical height and the transverse thickness being 
much less. As is the case with all the American races, the hallux and 
hind claw — the latter especially — are almost constantly shorter than in 
the European forms.

6. occidentalis Subsp. nov. 

Pacific coast of North America, breeding from mouutains of sontlieru Califoruia to 
British Cohmibia. 

^SText to mexicana, this is the darkest colored of all the races of this 
species. Ill extremely slender bill it agrees with moyiiana., but, appa- 
rently, has a shorter tail (although this apparent difference may be due 
to an insufficient number of specimens compared — one specimen hav- 
ing the tail .15 of an inch longer than the longest-tailed specimen of 
montana), but the colors are strikingly different. Instead of being 
grayer than rufa, occidentalis is much browner, extreme examples having 
the light patches of the remiges a bright ochreous-buff" and the general 
cast of the upper parts a decidedly rusty brown, such specimens com- 
ing chiefly from the coast of Washington Territory and British Colum- 
bia. The rump is a bright rusty fulvous, and the crissum always a deep 
ochreous-buff. Of the European races, this most resembles hrittanica 
in the color of the upper parts, some specimens being very similar in- 
deed; but the crissum is constantly much more deeply buff". In the 
darker- colored examples there is some resemblance to mexicana, in fact 
some of them have been labeled as such; but the rump is much less 
chestnut, the ])rimary coverts are always tipped with whitish, and the 
lower parts more whitish. Specimens measure as follows:

Tliis form differs conspicuously from all tbe others iu tlie total absence

NOTE OIV THE OCCimREIVCE OF A SII>VER IiAMPBEY, ICIITHY- 
OMYZOIV OASTAIVEUS, OIRARD, IIV t,OUISIANA. 

By TAKJLETON H. BEAN. 

Nearly two years ago Mr. N. B. Moore, of Forlorn Hope, Louisiana, 
sent to the National Museum, at the request of tlie Director, a lamprey 
which he perceived to be difierent from the sea-lamprey [Fciromyzon 
americamis^ = marimis), by comparing it with a description in ZelFs 
Encyclopedia. About that time the writer was on his way to Alaska, 
and had no opportunity to examine the specimen forwarded by Mr. 
Moore. It was placed in storage and came to my notice again only a 
few days ago. As this individual shows some unusual characters, it is 
worth while to call attention to them. It agrees pretty well with the ac- 
couht of the species described by Girard from Galena, Minn., under the 
name Iclithyomyzon casfcnwus, but shows a variation from the ascribed 
characters of the genus in having three close-set maxillary teeth, while 
some of the lateral teeth are bicuspid. 

I insert here Mr. Moore's description of the recent specimen : 

" I have a lamprey — first ever seen by me, and identified by a descrip- 
tion in Zell's Cyclopiedia. Thinking it quite far south for one of this 
species — Petromyzon amcricauus, if it be this one — I put it in whisky, 
and, as I found it to differ from that given in Zell in one particular, the 
dorsal fin being 4^- (inches) in length, continuous, not separated, I 
thought you would like to examine it. If so, I will send it to you. 
Total length, 9f inches ; anus to tip of tail fin, 2 ; between anterior and 
posterior gills, 1^; tip of snout to anterior gill, 1^; commissure of 
mouth, 2; greatest depth of lish at interior part of dorsal, |; greatest- 
width 2 (inches) from tip of snout, ^ ; thence a true taper to tip of tail 
in lateral outline; body not cylindrical. Color ochraceous about head, 
then yelloAvish gray; small blue dots from head to tail and on under 
side of neck." 

For convenience of comparison, I copy here Girard's description ot 
I. castaneus*: 

" Spec. Char.— Head depressed, constituting the ninth of the total 
length ; body and tail compressed. Buccal disk sub-elliptical, provided 
with a double series of short, tentacular fringes upon its periphery. 
Posterior margin of buccal aperture exhibiting a series of nine teeth, 
disposed upon an arc of a circle. Eyes small and inconspicuous; 
spiracle sub-tubular, raised above the surface of the head. Origin of 
the dorsal fin equidistant between the anterior margin of the buccal 
disk and the apex of the tail. Vent situated immediately in advance of 
the most elevated portion of the dorsal fin. Chestnut-colored, of a 
darker tint above than beneath, 

*<Rep. U. S. Pacific R. R. Surv., Fishes, 1858, pp. dtil-^. 



118 PEOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIOXAL MUSEUM. 

" What we have termed the head is measured from the anterior 
extremity of the buccal disk to the first brauchial orifice, the chest 
being the region occupied by the entire series, seven in number, of the 
same branchial orifices. 

" The length of the head is equal to that of the chest. The tentacles, 
at the periphery of the buccal disk, are inserted into a shallow groove, 
formed exteriorly by the thickened edge of the disk, and interiorly by 
a soft and flexible membranous ridge. The friuges themselves are more 
developed posteriorly than anteriorly. The branchial orifices are sub- 
circular, provided with two semi-circular lips, au anterior aud a i^osterior 
one, fringed upon their edge, and somewhat raised above the surface 
of the chest. 

" The dorsal fin exhibits two convex elevations, one anterior to the 
vent, the other posterior to it. Its continuity with the caudal is marked 
by a gradual shallow depression. The lower lobe of tlie caudal is rather 
more developed than the upper lobe. The tail itself is bluntly spear- 
sbaped. 

'^•Tlie color is of a uniform chestnut tint, somewbat lighter along the 
abdominal region than over the sides and back, which is much darker." 

The single typical specimen was catalogued at number 979. It was 
collected by Dr. George Suckley at Galena, Minn. 

In the example received from Mr. Moore the following characters are 
observed : 

Head 7f in total length; body and tail compressed. Labial fringes 
short everywhere, but more developed posteriorly than anteriorly. 
Maxillary teeth pointed, close-set, three in number; maudibulary plate 
crescent-shaped, with nine pointed teeth very gradually diminishing in 
size from the middle tooth to each end. Two of the lateral teeth on 
each side of the oral aperture bicuspid, the rest uuicuspid. Both series 
of lingual teeth finely pectinate. Eyes very small, obscure. Spiracle 
iibout once its own length in front of eyes. Origin of dorsal fin midway 
between spiracle aud end of tail. The dorsal fin is continuous, low in 
the first half of its length (about one-sixth the height of the part of the 
body under it), thence gradually rising to its greatest height a little 
behind the vent and again gradually diminishing to the emargination 
which separates it from the tail. The greatest height of the dorsal is 
less than one-half that of the body at the same point. The distance of 
the vent from end of tail equals 3 times height of body at vent. The 
space occupied by the gill-openings is about equal to length of head. 
Greatest height of body equals head to hind margin of eye. The tail 
small, no part of the fin surrounding it being much higher than the 
anterior half of dorsal. 

The alcoholic specimen now is almost uniforndy light brown replaced 
by chestnut in one small area on the belly a little in front of vent. The 
spots on head, chest, and back, which Mr. Moore descril^ed as blue, are 
now dark brown or nearly black, resembling fly-specks. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 119 

The leugtli of the specimen (numbered 30334) is now 9.3 inches; 
head 1.1; chest very nearly the same; greatest height of body, ^; vent 
to tip of tail, l-^tr; dorsal from end of head, 5. 

I have thought it worth while to describe this lamprey in some detail 
because of the interest which attaches to the locality and on account of 
the slightness of our knowledge of I. castaneus^ to which our present 
example is most closely related. 

United States National Museum, 

WasMngton, March 24, 1882. 

Since the above was written I have found and examined the types of 
Ichthyomyzon hirudo and I. castaneus Girard. The first is 5 inches long 
and is certainly congeneric with castaneus, from which it differs in the 
number of mandibulary cusps. The maxillary tooth is tricuspid and 
a few of the lateral teeth are bicuspid. Ichthyomyzon hirudo and J. cas- 
taneus, therefore, show a departure from the type of the genus, which 
is Petromyzon argenteus Kirtland; they have the dorsals continuous as 
in argenteus, but the dentition is different. The maxillary cusps in hi- 
rudo and castaneus are placed close together. The lingual teeth are pec- 
tinate throughout, as in Lampetra tridentaia. We are called upon now 
to decide whether Petromyzon argenteus Kirtland and Girard's two spe- 
cies of Ichthyomyzon {hirudo and castaneus) are all members of the genus 
Ichthyomyzon. In my opinion they are, but I should refer the three 
species of Ichthyomyzon to Petromyzon.

lNCl.ir»IN<J DESCRIPTIONS OF FIVE NE^V SPECIES. 

By ROSA SMITH awd JOSEPH SWAIRf. 

The specimens which form the subject of the present paper were ob- 
tained in the spring of 1880 at Johnston's Island, by the captain of a 
vessel belonging to the North Pacific Guano Company. A can of alcohol 
was sent out on this vessel by Professors David S. Jordan and Charles 
H. Gilbert during their stay on tlie Pacific Coast of the United States 
in the interest of tbe United States Fish Commission. Johnston's Island 
is located about 700 miles southwest of the Hawaiian Islands, and aj)- 
proximates IT^* north latitude, 170° west longitude. This collection, 
containing five new and many little known s^^ecies. Professor Jordan 
has turned over to the writers for study. The specimens are now in 
the United States National Museum. 

We are greatly indebted to Professor Jordan for the use of his library 
aud for many valuable suggestions.

13; A. II, 12; scales, 8-G6-12. 

Allied to P. ajyproximans, Lay & Beimett, from wliicli it chiefly differs 
in coloration, uiiniber of anal rays, and in its higher dorsal and anal fins. 
Body robust, compressed. Snout comparatively blunt; the profile 
from snout to dorsal gently and regularly curved. IMouth moderate, 
horizontal ; tip of mandible behind posterior nostril. Maxillary 2 in 
head. Teeth in a continuous villiform band on palatines and pterygoids, 
the patch broader, especially on the pterygoids, than in P. approximans^ 
and much broader than in P. opercular is ; the premaxillary band also 
broad. Eye in head about 3 J times, interorbital space slightly convex, 4 
in head. Preopercle with few and irregular serrations. Tooth above the 
lobe of preopercle well developed. Gill-rakers one-fourth length of max- 
illary; about 20 on lower limb. 

Scales large, almost smooth. Small scales nearly covering the soft 
dorsal, anal, and ventral fins; the membraneous flap of the spines of 
first dorsal scaled, but the connecting membrane entirely naked. Upper 
])ectoral rays scaled nearly to their tips; all the rays covered with 
scales at their base ; upper rays also closely scaled on posterior surface. 
Dorsal fins well developed; second and third spines longest, If in 
head, about three-fourths length of longest soft ray. The first two rays 
of second dorsal longest, about If in head. Caudal large, widely forked, 
the upper lobe slightly the longer, and one-fourth longer than head. 
Anal shorter than soft dorsal, the base of the tin three-fourths of its 
greatest height; when depressed the tips of the two anterior rays ex- 
tend verv nearly as far as the tip of the last ray ; the free margin of the 
tin lunate, similar to soft dorsal ; tirst rays four-tifths length of tirst rays 
of soft dorsal, and 1% in head. First anal spine very small ; second 4^ 
in head. Ventral tins in head If times. Pectorals If in head; pec- 
toral filaments G, the superior one longest, 1\ the length of head, reach- 
ing tip of ventrals. 
Air-bladder large. 
Adipose eyelid well developed. 

Color olivaceous, the scales finely punctulate with brown; these 
punctulations most numerous on the upper and lower margins of the 
scales, forming longitudinal streaks along the rows of scales. The scales 
from the snout to the first dorsal, on the belly, and the space between 
the aual and caudal fins smaller, and on these regions the brown 
points are aggregated on the margins of the scales, making their out- 
line conspicuous. Vertical fins dark; margin of dorsals blackish. Pec- 
toral dark, purplish underneath. Ventrals light, but with some brown 
punctulations. Preopercle plain except its flap, which, together with the 
other opercles, is rather dark.

Body ovate, compressed, elevated. Profile rather steep ; from snout 
to occiput slightly concave, thence evenly curved. Mouth oblique, 
maxillary terminating opposite anterior half of pupil ; lower jaw pro- 
duced ; snout pointed, 3^ in head ; eye 4 in head ; interorbital space 7 
in head ; intermaxillary groove as long as snout. The lower of the two 
opercular spines smaller than the upper. The prominent strife of oper- 
cle and suprascapula end in jioints, producing shari^ly serrate margins; 
all the other bones of shoulder-girdle smooth -, subopercle scarcely 
striate, rather reticulate, its margin nearly smooth ; posterior half of 
interopercle serrate; preopercle with a strong spine at the angle, which 
varies in length from 1 J to 2^ in the height of the straight upright limb 
of preopercle ; posterior edge of preopercle coarsely serrate and slightly 
slanted forwards. Nasal bones prominent. Fan-like striations on oc- 
ciput, and all the occipital bones coarsely serrate on their margins. 
The orbital rim much narrower than in H. erythrmis, also less deeply 
lobed and more finely denticulate. Supraocular region rough with mi- 
nute spines. As in R. crythrcvns, the infraorbital bone has a blunt 
tooth in front of the supplemental maxillary bone, and another beneath 
front part of eye, leaving the intervening space lunate and more or less 
serrate. 

First dorsal spine is If in the third, which is the highest, and If in 
depth of body ; the fourth is a trifle lower than the third, and thence 
the spines decrease regularly in height to the eleventh, which is 3f in: 
the highest spine. In soft part of dorsal the third, fourth, fifth, and. 
sixth rays are highest and equal the highest si)ine ; the last ray less 
than a third of the highest ; first ray unbranched, 1^ in greatest depth 
of the fin, the margin rounded. 

Caudal not deeply forked, its lobes rounded and about equal. Anal 
similar to soft dorsal, its third spine strong, 1\ in third dorsal s-piue.; 
Ventrals If in head. Pectorals scarcely longer. 

Color, in spirits, nearly uniform. Cheeks and dorsnl region some- 
what darker than elsewhere, there being dark puuctalations on the 
scales. Faint whitish lines follow the rows of scales along the sides, 
and are most noticeable on the caudal peduncle. The " halved" scales 
at base of spinous dorsal are of a bluish white superiorly. Fins plain, 
except that in one specimen the pectoral shows on the base of the 
rays on its posterior side a small gray spot formed by very minute 
punctulations. Peritoneum light.

anal a few narrow, silvery bands, the scales not punctate in this region. 
The spinous dorsal is marked by a series of roundish, white spots along 
middle of fin, and a triangular white spot behind tip of each spine ; the 
fins otherwise uniform. Peritoneum light. 

"This species appears to be near H. inccUopterum^ from which, how- 
ever, it differs in several respects * * * ; from H. Here it may be dis- 
tinguished by eleven dorsal spines, and from H. ticroides by a greater 
number of scales in the lateral line." [GUnther.)

Allied to Upeneits trifasclatus (Lac.) Cuv. & Val. 

Body less robust than in TJ. crassilabris. Profile from beginning of 
dorsal fin to a point above center of orbit, a gentle and regular curve; 
thence to the snout a straight oblique line. Snout rather pointed, lower 
jaw included; lips thin; maxillary 2f in head; eye rather small, high, 
and far back, its diameter contained 3^ times in the snout (measured 
obliquely from eye) and 5i times in the head. 

Teeth blunt, isolated, in a single series in each jaw; the overlapping 
upper jaw shows all the teeth of the premaxillary in the closed mouth. 
K"o teeth on vomer or palatines. A strong, blunt spine on opercle. 
Gill-rakers 28 on lower limb. 

Barbels slender and long, extending slightly beyond base of ventral, 
nearly as long as head. Scales ctenoid, moderate. 

Dorsal fins well developed ; third spine highest, equaling two-thirds of 
the greatest depth, the spines following about evenly decreasing in 
height to the eighth, which is two-sevenths of the third. In the second 
dorsal the first ray is shortest, 3'^ in depth of body, all between the first 
and ninth about equal and slightly higher than the first; the posterior 
half of the ninth, or split ray, is 2^ times as high as the intermediate 
rays, and exceeds the highest dorsal spine; when depressed it extends 
onto the caudal one-fifth of the greatest length of the caudal; outline 
of soft dorsal slightly concave. Anal about one-fifth higher than soft 
dorsal; its last ray, however, is less produced, being six-sevenths of the 
last ray of the dorsal, and, depressed, does not reach base of caudal;

Air-bladder large, lined witb black. 

Color, in spirits, yellowisb, witb dark markings; bead gray; a black 
spot on tbe median line between occiput and first dorsal ; a blackisb 
baud across tbe back between tbe dorsal fins, another at base of soft 
dorsal, and a tbird on tbe caudal peduncle; all tbese bands becoming 
ligbter below tbe lateral line; a gray blotcb below lateral line, nearer 
second band than tbe one on tbe tail. First and second dorsal spines 
black, tbe whole upper portion of spinous dorsal dark, tbe membrane 
connecting tbe fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh spines nearly black, 
forming a blotch ; second dorsal very dark, witb about three narrow 
whiteish stripes, and inconspicuous white spots on its base ; caudal plain, 
yellow, narrowly margined with brown above, less narrowly margined witb 
black below; anal dark, its marginal third witb three light lines disposed 
horizontally; nearer the base the membrane is crossed by white bars 
at right angles with the rays, almost forming a network of lines; pecto- 
rals dusky at base, otherwise plain yellow; ventral spine nearly black, 
the rest of the fin "dusky, witb about nine slightly waving lines of 
white across the rays. Lower lip and barbels gray, tips of the barbels 
fading into yellowish. Branchiostegal membrane dusky. Peritoneum 
light. 

This species is closely allied to TJ. frifasciatus (Lac.) C. & V., from 
which its most conspicuous differences (according to a figure in the 
Jour. Mus. Godeffroy) are the extreme elongation of tbe last ray in both 
tbe soft dorsal and tbe anal fin, and the greater length of the barbels, 
which pass beyond the base of the ventrals, while in this figure the bar- 
bels only reach the posterior margin of tbe subopercle. Lacepede's 
figures, copied from Commerson, represent the specimen which be calls 
Mnlliis hifasciatits as having the barbels shorter than the head, and M. 
trlfa sciatus witb tbe barbels nearly attaining the extremity of the ventral 
fins. Of tbe barbels Cuvier & Valenciennes say: "ils ne depassent 
pas I'angle du preopercule, et ceux du mulle trois-handes depassent 
meme I'opercule. Capendant la figure, qui est de Sounerat, les exagere, 
en les faisant aller jusques sous les ventrales." — (Hist. ^at. Poiss. 
iii, 4G8.) In the figures by Lacepede tbe dorsal and anal fins are low 
in both M. hlfasciatm and M. tri/asciatns.

Head louger than deep ; upper lip thin, lower lip narrow. Gill-rakers 
short, 13 on lower arch. Ventrals reach vent, nearly as long as head. 
The outer ray of ventral and outer rays of caudal produced. Scales on 
cheeks and occiput much smaller than elsewhere, in about 12 rows on 
the cheeks. 

The fatty hump on forehead, which is usually seen on mature indi- 
viduals in this genus, is wholly undeveloped. 

Color, in spirts, yellow olivaceous, with darker olivaceous waving- 
streaks running horizontally between the rows of scales ; these lines be- 
coming mere brown spots above and below, but forming two bands be- 
hind the eye, which converge into one in front of the eye; under jaw 
scarcely spotted except near the gape of the mouth. A dark brown 
blotch between the soft dorsal and the lateral line extending around the 
posterior part of the soft dorsal, /y-shaped, as seen from above, close 
up under the fin, but not extending on it ; the dorsal fin with a dark 
spot anteriorly, the margin of connecting membrane brownish along 
whole of spinous portion. Teeth white. 

A larger specimen (17 inches in length) is darker everywhere, with 
the dorsal, caudal and ventral fins dusky, and the blotch between soft 
dorsal and lateral line less prominent. The ventrals are longer, reach- 
ing third anal spine. 

Two fine specimens, numbered 26830, lof inches in length.

(In a straight horizontal series from head to caudal 15, about 11 in first 
row above lateral line.) 

Body ovate. Profile steep; from dorsal to occiput convex, thence 
concave to snout. Snout pointed, conical ; mouth nearly horizontal, 
maxillary 4 iu head ; teeth ordinary ; eye If in snout, 4 in head ; inter- 
orbital space 1^ in snout. 

Gill-rakers very short and slender ; suiDrascapula striate and dentate.

First closal spiue If in snout, theuce almost evenly increasing in lieiglit 
to tlie sixth, which is 2f in head, seventh to eleventh about equal, 
twelfth 2 in Lead ; the soft portion of dorsal higher than spinous, its 
highest rays 1^ in head, its margin rounded. The filiform elongation of 
the fifth ray is broken off. Caudal truncate. Middle rays of anal 
longest, giving a bluntly pointed outline to the fin ; second anal spine 
not as long as third and scarcely stronger, 2J in head. Ventrals If in 
head. Pectorals 1^ in head. Scales finely ctenoid. Fins scaled as usual. 

Preopercle crenulate at the angle and on lower margin. 

Color, in spirits, pale olivaceous with dark and black markings ; five 
dark lines ascend obliquely from shoulder-girdle to dorsal, seven similar 
ones ascend obliquely from anal meeting the anterior lines at a right 
angle ; above the seven lines and running parallel with them are about 
four wider greenish-brown bands, which anteriorly describe a right angle 
ascending to the dorsal, this part of the wide bands thus running par- 
allel with the lines on front part of body, the ground color between 
these bands being of a sulphur yellow. A black band descends perpen- 
dicularly across the eye, narrower and fading out above, a third wider 
than orbital diameter below the eye, the bands of the two sides, extend- 
ing across the interopercle, meet at the isthmus. A black oval spot near 
the margin on the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth soft rays of 
dorsal. Between the posterior spines of the dorsal the connecting mem- 
brane is narrowly margined with black, the soft dorsal edged with black 
to the twenty-third ray. The extreme edge of caudal fin is white, ante- 
rior to which is a narrow space of gray margined with black, then a 
dull-yellow lunate space equal in width to both the other marginings ; 
the base of the caudal being grayish leaves this lunate space outlined 
by a gray line, the dusky ground color covering the anterior two-thirds 
of the length of the fin. And with a thread-like line of black near its 
margin. Pectorals and ventrals plain. Peritoneum dusky.

Habitat. — Pacific Ocean. 

Head 3f (4|) ; depth 2 (2i) ; length (26838) 16 inches. D. 98; A. 78 ; 
scales about 95 ; Br. 6. 

Body elliptical, the profile continuous with the dorsal curve, the snout 
l^rojecting and the nasal bones forming a prominent knob; ventral out- 
line a regular and gentle curve from gill-opening to caudal peduncle ; 
lower jaw produced beyond upper, a pointed knob below and behind 
symphysis. 

Head not much higher than long ; mouth moderately oblique, small 
for a large mouthed species, the maxillary reaching little beyond an- 
terior rim of eye, 2f in head. Pointed teeth in two series in each jaw, 
those of the inner and larger series becoming somewhat smaller i)os- 
teriorly, the teeth on maxillary not extending as far back on the blind 
side; the outer series of few small teeth. Eyes small, the lower orbit 
7 in head, the upper one slightly smaller; the lower orbit wholly in 
advance of the upper; the concave iuterorbital space 2f in head; the 
orbital rim a sharp ridge without distinct knobs. 

Xostrils apparently wanting. Cheeks and opercles more or less scaly. 
Gill-rakers rather long, the length of longest 2 in upper orbit; 10 on 
lower part of arch, none above. 

Scales cycloid, not deciduous, similar on both sides, but without ac- 
cessory scales on the blind side. 

Dorsal fin beginning on the snout, the first ray on the blind side, 
about as long as superior orbit, the rays gradually increasing in height 
to the posterior third of the fin, where they are 2f in head ; thence rap- 
idly decreasing to end of fin. Anal similar, its highest rays not opposite 
the highest part of dorsal, but a little farther back. Pectoral of eyed 
side falcate, the second ray one-fourth longer than head, produced into 
a filament ; pectoral of blind side If in head. Ventrals moderate, when 
depressed reaching past front of anal. Caudal bluntly pointed, If in 
head. 

Coloration in spirits: everywhere mottled with gray and brown ; the 
fins (except pectoral on blind side) marked with same colors, but the 
spots more nearly round and less complicated. On the colored side 
there is a large, irregular blackish blotch behind pectoral, a round black 
spot on the lateral line half way between head and caudal fin. About 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 143 

twelve blackish spots at regular intervals on dorsal fin, six or seven 
similar ones on anal. The ventral on the eyed side is marked like 
the anal. The colors and spots extend over on the blind side on the 
nasal bones, j)remaxillary, chin, and interopercle. The skinny flap in 
the month between the teeth and vomer is also spotted. 

One specimen (2G838), 16 inches in length. 

This species, well described and figured by Broussonet in 1782, seems 
not to have been seen by any succeeding author. The specific name 
^hnancus^^ has been wrongly transferred by Dr. Giinther to the very 
different Platophrys hetcropJithalmus of the Mediterranean.

NOTES OIV BIRDS COL.f.ECTEl> DIRINO THE SIMMER OF ISSO IIV 
ALASKA AND SDBERIA. 

By TARI.ET01V H. BEAW. 

The collection which is the subject of the present paper was made by 
the writer while investigating the fish and fisheries of Alaska for the 
TJuired States Fish Commissioner, in company with the Coast Survey 
party commanded by Mr. W. H. DalL 

Owing to the engrossing nature of the primary object of my inquiry 
and the limited number ot days jiassed in port, there was little oppor- 
tunity for collecting and observing birds. However, as fish were not 
plentiful north of the Arctic circle and birds were comparatively abund- 
ant and desirable for the Museum, much of my time was devoted to 
making bird skins while in that region. Especial eifort was made, also, 
to procure a good series of skins of the species of Melofunza, inhabiting 
the mainland and islands of the Territory. The region in w hich M. fas- 
ciata rufina occurs is so interesting and rich ichthyologically that birds 
were necessarily neglected, and this sparrow is represented by only a 
few skins. The' insular species {einerea), on the other hand, came in for 
a larger share of attention. 

In order to give an idea of the time which one may ordinarily' devote 
to bird-collecting who is not sent upon that special duty, I will state 
here the number of days which were devoted mainly or partly to that 
work during the six months of our cruise : May, 2 days ; June, 11; July, 
11 ; August, 9 ; September, 9 ; October, 7 ; in all 49 days. 

Although the number of species secured is small (less than a third of 
the whole number known to occur in Alaska), there are some interesting 
features about the collection. Many of the species here mentioned are 
from localities north of the Ar<;tic circle, and some of them were not 
previously recorded from the Territory. The specimen of Ui(rinorhyuchi(s 
liygmwus obtained by our party in Plover Bay was the first secured for 
an American museum, and is in a plumage wdjich has not yet been illus- 
trated. Six young individuals of Saxicola ananthe were found between 
Port Clarence and Cape Lisburne. Empidonax (lifficilis and Buteo bore- 
alis calm us were obtained for the first time in the Territorj\ The range 
oH Actodromas acuminata was extended northward to Port Clarence. 

Larus marinus was found to be common on Unalaslika Island, though 
previously unknown in Alaska. 

Bioincdea melanophrys was seen within 1,000 miles west of Cape Men-

dociuo, California, and may safely be claimed for the ftiuna of the United 
States. The nests of Hirimdo erythrogastra and Melosjyiza fasciata 
rufina are worthy of more extended examination than I have been able 
to give them. 

On the 23d of October, when about 700 miles south of Unalashka 
Island, a small flock of geese was seen flying towards the southeast, and 
sometimes resting on the water. We did not sail close enough to make 
them out, but there is little doubt that they belonged to the genus Anser. 
Mr. Dall, Mr. Baker, Captain Herendeen, and I looked at them with a 
glass, and all agreed as to the identification. Owing to the distance, 
we could not determine the species. 

So far as most of the species are concerned 1 have simply transcribed 
my hastily made field notes. In a few cases, however, I have supple- 
mented these fragments by subsequent investigations in the Museum. 
Even in this small collection there still remains some material that is 
worthy of the attention and will, doubtless, eventually receive the notice 
of an ornithologist. 

To Mr. Dall I owe the opportunity of joining his party, and he, as well 
as his assistants, contributed as much as possible to the collection; the 
probability of finding Eurinorhynclms at Plover Bay was first suggested 
by Mr. Dall. 

I am much indebted to Mr. Robert Ridgway for aid in determining 
the species collected by me and for advice in the preparation of these 
notes.

At Cape Lisburne this bird was found with Anthus ludoviciamis, but 
was not nearly so abundant as the titlark. I saw it also 10 miles to the 
eastward of Cape Lisburne. Its movements are similar to those of An- 
thus. It was feeding here on grass seeds and fruit of Saxifroga, and was, 
in consequence, excessively fat. 

On Chamisso Island the only two seen were secured ; they were on a 
sand and gravel beach and the low bluffs adjacent. 

Capt. E. P. Herendeen went ashore, September 1, on the east side of 
Choris Peninsula and reported having seen stouechats, one of which 
he wounded but could not get. Owing to the rain he found it useless 
to attempt to collect small birds. 

At Port Clarence only one was seen ; this was near the beach on the 
west side of the spit. The day was cold and windy, with a little rain and 
some snow. Plectrophanes nivalis was of more frequent occurrence, 
though not plentiful ; Centrophanes lapponicus was rather common.

This was one of only eight species of land birds seen by me October 
6 to 18, 1880. The other birds were Passerculm sandwichensis, Melos- 
piza cinerea, Corvus corax carnivorns, Leucosticte griseinucha, Arquatella 
Couesii, Heteroscelus incanus, and Ealicvetus leucoceplialus. Lagopus ru- 
pestris was, of course, present, but I did not find it. 

Anortliura was more abundant at Chernoffsky than at Iliuliuk. At 
both places I found it frequenting the rocks near the water's edge and 
the faces of cliffs looking seaward.

8. MOTACILLA OCULARIS SwinllOC. 

81341 (3595) 9 (?). Port Providence, Plover Bay, Siberia, Aug. 14, 1880. 

Only one individual certainly seen; occurring with Budytes flava in 
the vicinity of the native summer tents ; very hard to approach. Judg- 
ing from the uniformly small number of specimens of this bird secured 
by collectors in Plover Bay, the species seems to be rare in that locality.

These wagtails were present in small numbers on the spit at Port 
Providence, and they were exceedingly shy. They were seldom seen at 
the tents, but usually in the grass. They were sometimes heard in the 
air, chirping while in flight. 

A single wagtail was seen flying towards the point of the spit at Port 
Providence, September 13, but I could not determine the species. 

It may not be out of place here to remark that, on the 15th of Sep- 
tember, Mr. Baker and Captain Herendeen, of the coast-survey party, 
walked through a divide leading from Port Providence to Moore Lake 
and saw no birds except ravens. The few land birds still remaining at 
this port were near the sea-shore.

The Little Koniushi Island example was found at the top of the ridge 
overlooking Northwest Harbor, at least 1,000 feet above the sea level. 

At Cape Lisburne most of the specimens seen of this wagtail were in 
a little valley through which runs a small stream, and on the low plateau 
east of this stream. They were feeding on seeds of Saxifraga mainly.

(3533) i & 9, alcoholic. Cave Rock, Unalashka, July 23, 1880. 
(3510) nest of above, with 4 young, July 28, 1880. 

A pair of the above species of swallow was observed for some time 
circling around Cave Eock, on Amaknak Island, near Iliuliiik. In the 
mouth of the cave was the nest here to be described. The swallows 
were not seen on the nest, but there is no reasonable doubt that the pair 
obtained were the owners. 

The nest in its present condition is 5i inches long; the greatest depth 
of the front wall is 3 inches ; the grass lining, on which is placed an 
additional cushion of feathers, is 3i inches long and nearly 3 inches 
wide on top; the bacli: wall of the nest contains only grasses and sea- 
weeds ; the mud wall separates readily into only four layers. The mud 
in its dry state crumbles very readily, and could not have had great 
cohesive power originally. To remedy this defect, the pellets were in- 
termingled with a long, narrow, red sea-weed which has considerable 
strength and furnishes a sticky secretion well adapted for holding them 
together, and the same sea-weed was employed between the layers. 
The mud was evidently found on the shore close to high-water mark, 
as it contains numerous small shells which may be always seen in such 
location. The grass seems to be mainly the common wild rye of the 
vicinity. The inner lining is ample and prettily arranged. It consists 
of soft feathers of young bald eagle, raven, and gull, tastefully inter- 
twined, and forming a shallow, but luxurious, cushion. 

The structure and situation of this nest are similar to what Mr. Eidg- 
"way observed at Pyramid Lake and the Euby Mountains;* but the 
limited number of mud layers of the Unalashka nest and the introduc- 
tion of a glutinous sea weed to supply the defective cohesive i)ower of 
the pellets forming the wall, afford a new illustration of the faculty 
which this swallow possesses of adapting itself to the conditions of its 
environment.

From tlie above list of skins, secured on Chamisso Island, it will be 
observed that these red polls M'ere quite abundant there; indeed it was 
the only land bird found in numbers. Some grouse were seen, but not 
by me. A single Passercidus was observed and secured. Two young 
stone chats {Saxlcola ocnanthc) were obtained; no others were seen. On 
this island the land rises gradually from the sides and ends, so that a 
very regular curve is shown. AVith the exception of numerous hum- 
mocks, which greatly impede walking, there are no serious hinderances 
to collecting. The island is covered Mith grass, alder, and willow, and 
there is also a dwarf birch. Wild rye is present in considerable patches 
in some places. Salmou berries, whortleberries, empetrum, and another 
berry which is not edible, were all abundant. There are some little rills 
of tolerably good water. We found JEglothm most abundant, swaying 
on the stalks of wild rye and in the small trees lining the rivulet banks. 
There are some cliffs in a tumble-down condition, and occasional deep 
cuts between and small stretches of sand beach. On these cliffs were 
immense numbers of puffins. 

Many of these .skins of the white-rumped redpoll show a great amount 
of wearing of the feathers, particularly of the tail, and in one bird the 
tail is tinely graduated.

On Little Kouiusbi Island I obtained one adult male and several 
young birds — all of tbem from the top of the ridge several times refer- 
red to. The young were able to make short flights only. 

At Plover Bay Plectrophanes nivalis was found in small numbers, 
generally feeding on refuse near the summer tents ; difficult to shoot on 
that account, and when it flew away it was hard to overtake, since it 
remained only a few seconds in once place. 

Near Icy Cape, Alaska, Plectrophanes was again scarce, shy, and hard 
to shoot. One of these buntings, which w^as followed for a long time, 
but not secured, showed a nearer approach to the winter plumage than 
the individual brought down. 

At Point Belcher P. nivalis was more abundant than at any of the 
other localities where we obtained it, although even here there were 
comparatively few, Centroplianes lapponicus being much more common. 

At Port Clarence few of the species were seen; they were usually 
found not far from the beach, not going inland on the spit like Centra- 
phanes. 

As we approached Cape Upright, Saint Mathew Island, September 
22, 1880, small flocks of the snow bunting from the land flew around the

At Port Clarence the bird was common in small flocks, feeding on 
seeds, usually near the small lagoons which are present on the spit. 

At Cape Lisburne and 10 miles to the eastward I observed numerous 
examples on the 21st and 22d of August, feeding, as usual, on seeds of 
species of Saccifraga, and congregating in small flocks. 

At Poiut Belcher, August 27, there were more of this species than at 
any other place visited by us. They were, as elsewhere, feeding on 
grass seeds and the seeds of flowering plants, among which Saxifraga 
was most common. Number 81358 of this lot is worthy of mention ou 
account of the deformity of its bill; the gonysis nearly twice as long as 
the culmen and decidedly hooked.

The spit in Chugachik Bay, on which I collected birds July 1, 1880, 
is low and level, its beaches higher than the interior. At some high 
tides the sea breaks over and carries with it immense numbers of fish, 
which are left stranded when the waters recede. This occurred a few 
days before our visit, and we saw thousands upon thousands of fishes 
lying uncovered on the ground. Great quantities of drift-wood are 
found here. Wild wheat abounds, and there are many pretty flow- 
ering plants, among which are serrana, violets, chickweed, vetch, and 
Jacob's ladder. There is also a little grove of Sitka spruces, in which I 
found the redpolls {JEgiotlms) and thrushes. Passercnlns was quite 
abundant in the wild wheat. On this spit was found the young eider 
which I have numbered in my catalogue. 

On the 2d of July we visited Glacier spit, distant 9 miles from our 
anchorage. Here a pair of eagles had a nest on one of the tall pines. 
A small plover, resembling the killdeer and with similar actions, was 
shot but badly mutilated and finally lost. 

The specimen of Passerculus obtained on Chamisso Island was the only 
one seen there.

81385(3357) <? juv. " •' " " "' " " 

Common at Graham Harbor ; frequently seen feeding on the beach. 

The nest found on George Island (Port Althorp) is made of coarse 
grasses, loosely laid together below, and interlaced with strips of what ap- 
pears to be the leaf of Panax Jiorridum, and with the light inner bark of 
the same. The superstructure is of flue grasses more intimately woven. 
The greatest depth of the nest is 4 inclies, and its diameter is from 5 to 7 
inches. The inside lining is 2i inches across the top and 2 inches deep. 
The nest was supported by a dead stalk of Panax and concealed in 
the tall, coarse grass which is abundant in that locality. 

Number 81385 bears a wonderfully close resemblance in coloration 
and general appearance to number 81384 from Kodiak, which is sup- 
posed to be cinerea; it will be observed, however, that there is consider- 
able difference in the measurements. 

As nearly as I can determine from the material in the collection, the 
conclusions expressed in the History of North American birds by 
Baird, Brewer, and Kidgway are fully justified. There is a large 
series of skins of cinerea from Kodiak and Unalashka, but the repre- 
sentation of fasciata rufina is still unsatisfactory, and the song sparrow 
of the western islands of the Aleutian chain has a meager showing. A 
study of the collection in its present state, as already remarked, will 
lead us to the adoption of the views advanced iii the History of North 
American Birds: Melosirlza fasciata r?r/iwa is notably smaller than Jl/. 
cinerea in its wing, tail, tarsus, middle toe, and all measurements of the 
bill; in coloration, also, adult birds of the two species differ greatly. 

The following table of measurements deals with all the skins now ac- 
cessible in the collection which have been referred to fasciata rufina. 
For convenience of reference, the average measurements of the large 
series of skins of M. cinerea are brought on the same sheet :

A nest of this sparrow containing 4 eggs was sent over from Wooded 
Island, Kodiak, July 11, 1880, by Nicolas Pavloff. 

On little Koniusbi Island it was not uncommon on the low ground 
bordering Northwest Harbor. Not seen on the beach, because there is 
none, properly speaking, and small Crustacea would scarcely occur in 
sufficient numbers to attract these sparrows. 

It frequents the sea-shore at Chernoffsky and Iliuliuk, feeding among 
sea-weeds. 

Upon examination of the measurement tables of J/, cinerea the pecu- 
liarities of birds from Kyska and Attn will appear; the small bill, even 
of the adult bird, is noteworthy, and it is to be hoped that sufficient 
material will soon be obtained to determine the extent and value of this 
divergence.

The afternoon of July 4, 1880, was decidedly warm for bird-collecting 
at Graham Harbor, and I have a lively recollection of the difficulties 
encountered in the timber at that place. The sound of a woodpecker 
tapping on a dead tree allured me to the chase. There was a lavish 
display of flowering plants — American cowslip, salmon berry, anemones, 
and a beautiful blue cranesbill. Frost had nipped the detestable wild 
ginseng {Panax horridum), but unfortunately had not destroyed the en- 
tire crop. Mosquitos were at the climax of their capacity for making 
life wretched. The only bird that could be approached Avitli a degree 
of comfort was the song sparrow {Melospiza fasciata rufina), which fre- 
quented the beach and its immediate vicinity. Fasserella hid in the re- 
cesses of the timber, and the way to him led through stinging acres of 
Panax, over legions of briar-beset, snaggy fallen trees, into numberless 
concealed pitfalls, and within the jurisdiction of the most relentless mos- 
quitos known to man. Bird-collecting here was simply a painful duty, 
and the rcAvard of honest labor was inadequate, because one was al- 
most sure to lose a bird after killing it in that maze of undergrowth. 

On Little Koniushi Island I found this Passerella associated with Plee- 
trophanes nivalis and Anthus ludovicianus on the top of the ridge over- 
looking Northwest Harbor, about 1,200 feet above the sea level. Walk- 
ing on this island is simply torture, especially for one who is intent on 
birds and takes no heed to his steps. The soil is soft and yielding, and 
in most places thickly covered with loose rocks, scrub alder, and a kind 
of wild apple — all mingled in such a way as to impede one's progress 
and multiply his toil. Sitka and Port Mulgrave are little better for 
comfortable walking than the localities just described ; indeed, most of 
the timbered region, so far as I have observed, is a most discouraging 
field for pedestrianism.

upon the victims, tbey cany them up iuto the air and let them fall from 
a great height. If the first fall does not kill the rat, he is captured 
again and carried higher. The rats are eaten by ravens. 

I shot at a raven at Cape Lisburne, August 21, but failed to kill it. 
On the following day I heard one at a distance on one of the hills, 10 
miles to the eastward of this cape. 

Again, at Chamisso Island, Eschscholtz Bay, I attempted to kill a 
raven with small shot and failed. 

I saw, but could not obtain, a fine bird of this species at Elephant 
Point, Eschscholtz Bay, September 2, 1880. 

At Port Providence, Plover Bay, Siberia, ravens were extremely 
abundant September 14, and so gorged with blubber and overrun with 
parasites that it was too disgusting to i)repare skins of them. At the 
head of the spit I watched their movements for some time, as they did 
not fear me while I sat still and made no sudden movement. They 
would alight close to my head and look at me with apparent curiosity, 
uttering now^ and then a hoarse call to other ravens flying near at hand. 
Hopping forward a step or two, they would pull oft' pieces of moss from 
the stones and jump slightly into the air in an aft'ected sort of way, 
sometimes taking a good-sized stone in the beak, perhaps to see if any 
food might be concealed underneath. Occasionally, one would find a 
morsel, and then another would try to take it out of his bill, the lucky 
one seeming to hold out the prize temptingly, but firmly, to tantalize 
his covetous neighbor. In starting to tly they would strike the ground 
with their feet several times to gain an impetus.

Abundant at Sitka, May 28 to June 16, 1880, associated with the pre- 
ceding. Voice variable, usually less ringing and hoarser than that of 
C.frngii'orus, but sometimes an exact counterpart of it. Without some 
definite and reliable mode of recording the notes of this fish crow for 
comparison with those of the common eastern species, there must be 
doubt as to the relation between the voices of the two birds. 

A small flock was seen at George Island, Port Althorp, June 19, 1880, 
perched on the rocks, and feeding on a gravel beach at low tide.

28. Cyanocitta stelleri (Gm.) Caban. 

(30:}7) <?. Old Sitka (mouth of river), Juue 2, 1880. 

81392 (30G3) ^. Near Hot Springs Bay, Baraaotf Id., June 5, 1880. 
Measurements of number 3037 in the fresh state : Length, 13 ; ex- 
tent, 18.37 ; wing, 6; tail, 6; crest, 2 ; testis, .37. When shot, this bird 
had its mouth and crop crammed full of insects. 

A bird of this species was shot at Port Althorp, June 19, but was lost 
in a dense thicket. 

29. Empidonax difficilis Baird. 

81393 (3067) ad. ^ . Near Hot Springs Bay, (Sitka), Alaska, June 5, 1880. 

This individual was oue of a few examples seen at the place noted. 
It is the first speccimen of the species recorded from Alaska, and, so 
far as I know, the only one. From the size of the testes (.25) it is proba- 
ble that this date represents very nearly the breeding time of this fly- 
catcher in the locality named. 

The fresh bird furnished the following measurements : Length, 5.25; 
extent, 7.50 5 wing, 2.62. 

30. Selasphorus rufus (Gmel.) Aud. 

(3097) juv. Sitka.

A live humming bird, with its nest and eggs, was brought into Mr. 
Whitford's store at Sitka, June 9, 1880, but none of our iiarty were pres- 
ent at the time, and we did not get them. 

31. Nyctea scandiaca Linn. 

(3681) sternum of 81397. 

81397 (3689) i ad. Point Belcher, Alaska, Arctic O. Aug. 27, 1880. 

Common on the gently rising ground inlaud from the small lake near 
our anchorage. I saw as many as six atone time on small grassy mounds. 
They were uniformly hard to approach, never allowing me to come 
within gun-shot, except in the one instance when I crept along under 
cover of the low bluff forming one of the lake borders, and rose sud- 
denly within easy range. 

32. Hierofalco gyrfalco sacer (Forst.) Eidgw. 

81398 (3838) $ . Bering Sea, 60 miles E.S.E. from St. George Island. Sept. 24, 1880. 
(3838) sternum of above. 

This individual was shot while trying to alight on the vessel ; it 
dropped into the leach of the mainsail, and from thence into the cockpit, 
where it was secured. Two examples of this species, according to my 
belief, were around the vessel between St. Mathew and St. Lawrence 
Islands, a few days i^revious to this date. One of them was shot, but 
lost. 

Proc. Nat. Mus, 82 11 July 25, 1 8 83. 



162 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The following color notes and measurements were taken from the bird : 
Iris brown; tarsus and toes bluish gray; bill the same at base, but 
black at tii) ; eyebrows bluish gray. 

Ovaries little developed; eggs not distinguishable to the unaided eye. 

Length, 21; extent, 44; wing, 14; tail, 9; tarsus, 2.37; bill, 1.12; 
head, 2.50; middle toe, 1.94; middle toe claw, .81. 

33. Pandion haliaetus carolinensis (Gm.) Eidgw. 

81668 (3150) head. Hot Springs, Barauoff Island, Alaska, June 9, 1880. 
("3151) sternum. " " " " " " " 

This specimen of the osprey was shot by Capt. E. P. Herendeen near 
Hot Springs. 

34. Circus hudsonius (Linn.) Yiell. 

81401 (3720) 9. Elephant Point, Eschscholtz B., Alaska, Sept. 2, 1880, 

Several individuals of this hawk were seen flying over the marshes 
in the vicinity of Elephant Point. The following color notes and meas- 
urements were taken from the recently-killed bird : 

Length, 21.50; extent, 47.50; wing, 15.50; tail, 10.50; bill, 1.19; head, 
2; tarsus, 3.37; middle toe and claw, 2.37; middle toe claw, .75. 

Iris brown. The upper tail coverts are not white, as is usually re- 
corded of this species, but whitish, with many blotches of rufous. 

35. BuTEO BOREALis CALURUS (Cass.) Eidgw. 

81399 (3060) 9 (?).iuv. Baranoff Id., near Sitka, Alaska, June 5, 1880. 

This young hawk was shot by Lieutenant Eockwell, U. S. I^., near 
Hot Springs Bay. I have the following notes from the recently-killed 
bird: Iris very light hazel; length, 21.50; extent, 47.50; wing, 14.50; 
tail, 9. This species has not been previously recorded from Alaska. 

36. Archibuteo lagopus sancti-johannis (Gmel.) Eidgw. 

81400 (3466) 9 • Popoff Island, Shumagins, July 18, 1880. 

Iris hazel. Cere yellow, with a greenish tinge. Lips and feet lemon 
yellow. Eggs very small. 

Measurements from the fresh bird : Length, 23 ; extent, 50.50 ; wing, 
18; tail, 10.06; bill, 1.37; head, 2.25; tarsus, 2.94; middle toe and 
claw, 2.19 ; middle toe claw, .81. 

37. Haliaetus leucocephalus (Linn.) Savig. 

(3293) sternum. Port Althorp, Alaska, June 19, 1880. 

Very abundant in the vicinity of Sitka, May 28 to June 16, 1880, 
usually around shallow coves in the neighborhood of the mouths of 
fresh water streams. 

A pair of young birds of this species was seen at Iliuliuk, Unalashka, 
October 13, 1880.

38. Lagopus albus (Gm.) Aud. 

81402 (3482) 9 . Unga Id., Shumagins, July 21, 1880. 

The crop was filled with leaves of a species of willow. Several of the 
birds were seea on low ground not far away from the ocean beach, in 
the vicinity of a small trout stream. 

This specimen corresponds very closely in most respects with number 
33548, a female from Korway, collected July 2, 1862 ; the claws, how- 
ever, are considerably shorter than in the Norway exami)le, aud in all 
other specimens of albus in the Museum,

The single example secured in Alaska was in adult male summer 
plumage. It was found on a small rock in the cove near the old fish- 
house at Sitka. The following measurements were taken from the fresh, 
bird: Length, 12.50; extent, 24.87; wing, 7.G9, 

The individuals obtained at Plover Bay were the only two of the 
species seen there. They were found on the spit which forms the har-

It was a real pleasure to collect land birds at Belkoffsky, although 
few species were found — only Centrophanes lapponicns and Passercuivs 
sandtcichensis besides the small sand piper. Walking was comfortable 
and there were many small, rapid streams of delightfully cool water 
rushing down from the steep hill behind the village. The valley be- 
tween this hill and the sea is undulating, free from alder and other im- 
pediments to travel, rich in grasses and flowers, and abounding in 
patches of exceedingly hard stones covered with lichens. Iris, geranium, 
aster, Finguicula, azaleas, Jacob's ladder, painted cups, yarrow, and 
water willow were in bloom. A fine salmon river falls into Belkoflsky 
Bay, and salmon were beginning to ascend. On the low ground birds

Pavlolf,is visible from the village, and was sending up columns of smoke 
during our stay.

The Unalashka specimen was in winter plumage, the only one seen 
there. Its call drew me towards it. 

At Port Providence no others were observed except the two here 
recorded. They were found standing on the rocks near the eastern 
border of the harbor, teetering like some of the small species of Acto-

Immense flocks of this phalarope were heard and seen off Cape Tchap- 

lin. Their twittering was a very pleasant sound. The day was calm, 
clear, and pleasant, so that a line opportunity was afforded for the use 
of the dredge and the pursuit of phalaropes. At Point Belcher again 
we saw large flocks of the same species, feeding in the swash of the 
tide along the beach, and drifting shoreward with the incoming current 
from short distances at sea. The northern phalarope, on the other 
hand, was observed at the margins of fresh- water lagoons.

81424 (3791). Port Clarence, Alaska, Sept. 6, 1880.' 

In small flocks, feeding at the margins of fresh- water lagoons. Four 
individuals were shot. 

The spit at Port Clarence, where I collected birds, is long, narrow, and 
curved. The width at the astronomical station of the " Yukon" party 
must have been about three-fourths of a mile. The ground is level, and 
walking good; there are numerous fresh lagoons of very palatable water, 
around which birds collect. There are no trees except the very scrubby 
dwarf willows. We found a few flowering plants, and manj^ exquisite 
lichens. The shallow lagoons are well stocked with sticklebacks. Cen- 
trophanes lappoulcus was common ; a few Plectrophanes nivalis were seen 
and only one Saxicola amanthe. A wagtail was observed on the 6th and 
again on the 8th of September, but too far off for identification. Lams 
glaueescens was abundant, associated with kittiwakes. 

I saw here a bird which I supposed to be a small wren ; it appeared 
unexpectedly, when my attention was fixed on other si:>ecies, alighted 
not very far off, was marked down and diligently searched for in a place 
where there was no apparent chance of escape, but unfortunately could 
not be found. 

53. Grus CANADENSIS (Linn.) Temm. 

On the 18th of August, in the vicinity of the Diomede Islands, sand- 
hill cranes were seen flying towards the American shore.

On the 22d of August, while at anchor 10 miles to the eastward of 
Cape Lisburne, we first observed brant migrating southward; great 
numbers of them passed us during the day. On the 25th of August 
we found them very abundant on the brackish -water lagoons of the s^jit 
near Icy Cape.

Bill light greenisli yellow ; eyelids, commissure, and iuside of mouth 
deep orauge red ; legs and feet black. 

The feet of two individuals shot at Cape Lisburne are preserved in 
alcohol. There is a well-developed nail on the hind toe of one of these 
feet, while the rest of the nails are quite rudimentary. The pair of feet 
havingthebest developed nails had, when fresh, a mere trace of yellowish 
on the skin of the under surface of the toes, while the other pair had 
bright yellow areas on the corresponding parts. 

The young female shot at St. Mathew Island was in the nest. The 
nests were built of sea-weeds on high, narrow ledges of the inaccessible 
cliff's. Abundant in this locality with Fratercula corniculata and Ftil- 
marus glaciaUs Rodgersi. At St. Mathew Island we saw a great many 
beautiful young kittiwakes flying near Cape Upright, the black collars 
and wing j)atches making them attractive objects of pursuit.

The eggs of this bird (81427) were very small. The species was very 
common, with Kyctea scandiaca, on the rising ground, industriously feed- 
ing upon something which I could not make out because of the diffi- 
culty of approaching the birds. The flights of this jjeger from sea- 
ward to the land and back again were frequent. We found Stercorarius 
very abundant in the vicinity of the whaling shij^s, where it fared sump- 
tuously.

(3009) ad. 9 . Pacific Ocean, Lat. 36° 32' N., Long. 126° 13' W., May 15, 1880. 

The "Yukon" sailed from San Francisco May 13, proceeding to the 
westward several hundred miles and then laying her course for Sitka. 
From the time we leit the bar until we neared north latitude 52 degrees 
on this voyage D. nigripes was with us every day, soaring around us 
w^hen we had a good breeze and leisurely following in our wake or float- 
ing astern when the wind was light or wanting. On the above date 
(May 15) we caught three of these birds with a fish-hook baited with 
pork. Soon after taking them on deck one of them became seasick, and 
ejected a piece of pumice. One of the calls of this albatross is similar 
to the peeping sound of very young chickens. It makes a peculiar sound, 
too, by striking its jaws together when approached on deck, and can in- 
flict a painful wound with its sharp hook. These gouies pick up what- 
ever floating food is cast from the vessel, and it is surprising to see how 
soon after anything is cast overboard a flock of the birds will approach, 
although none may be in sight at the time. In alighting after rapid 
flight they back air with their wings, drop their legs and thrust their 
feet forward to back water, making a light splashing. As soon as a 
small flock has gathered the gonies begin to fight and scream over their 
floating food, watching one another to see when anything turns up, the 
quickest and strongest getting the most. One of the most laughable 
things we saw was the chase of an overloaded Fraterctda by one of these 
gonies ; the Fraterctda skimmed along close to the surface of the water 
and sometimes apparently floundering through it, as if its bodj" were 
too heavy for its wings ; the gony followed in hot haste but was soon 
foiled, astonished, and apparently much disgusted by the unexpected 
diving of the little struggler. 

As we proceeded northward we observed a larger proportion of old 
birds with the upper and under tail coverts and part of the belly white. 
We saw no individuals of D. nigripes as far north as Sitka on the north- 
ward voyage. On our homeward way late in October, we saw the spe- 
cies frequently when about 700 miles south of Unalashka; a few were re- 
ported within 300 miles south of this island. 

Measurements of number 3009 from the fresh specimen: Length, 
28.50; extent, 79.50; wing, 19.50; tail, 6; bill, 3.75; head, 2.87; tarsus, 
3.50; middle toe, 4; middle toe claw, .02; iris umber; tarsus, foot, base 
and tip of bill black ; remainder of bill plumbeous. 

A second living one, caught with the last, had the bill 4.

(3333) sternum of 3301. 

The specimen here mentioned was shot by Capt. E. P. Herendeen near 
the mouth of the inlet, not far from Fort Alexander. The species was 
abundant. This example was moulting ; some of the primaries are rudi- 
mentary. It has been extremely difficult to kill these birds because they 
never come near the vessel nor allow it to approach them closely. Un- 
like D. nigripes, it is extremely shy. 

Measurements from the recently-killed bird: Extent, 88; wing, 21; 
tail, 6.75 ; head, 3.75 ; bill, 5.19 ; tarsus, 3.87 ; middle toe and claw, 5.12. 
Bill flesh color, with a faint purplish tinge; hook light horn color; 
iris dark brown. 

The Kodiak native name for this gony is Kay-mahryeerk'. 

In about north latitude 51 degrees we begun to lose sight of D. nigripes, 
and i>. hrachyura took its place. From latitude 52 degrees north the 
latter species increased in numbers. We found it at various points 
around the Gulf of Alaska, but the mouth of Cook's Inlet, and the vicinity 
of the Barren Islands, seemed to be its favorite summer resort. Natives 
of the trading village Alexandrovsk frequently spear this bird from their 
bidarkas. I picked up four skins of this species from a pile of refuse at 
this village. 

We saw !>. hrachyura in Unimak Pass July 25, and in Bering Sea, off 
Makusbin, on the following day. A single individual was seen August 
10 about 40 miles to the westward of the entrance to Plover Bay. An- 
other individual was seen September 18 to the northward of St. Law- 
rence Island. On the 22d of September we saw a few of these birds in 
the vicinity of St. Mathew Island. On the 5th of October we saw a few 
individuals, in beautiful plumage, while under sail from Chernoffsky, 
along the west coast of Unalashka, to Iliuliuk. 

70. DiOMEDEA MELANOPHRYS Temm. 

On the 3 1st of October a single Biomedea was seen on the Pacific not 
far from the following position : North latitude 40° 30', west longitude 
142° 23'. Observing that it differed greatly from the common D. nigripes, 
I made these notes concerning it: Head, neck, lower parts, and rump 
white ; the under surface of the wings, too, shows considerable light 
color ; elsewhere the bird is dark gray like n i gripes ; in size it is slightly 
less than the nigripes around it; the dark part of the wing of this bird 
is very different from the black of D. hrachyura so far as observed; the

bill is light ; a dark streak runs from the bill behind the eye ; the bird 
could not be secured. 

This description, taken while the bird was flying- near the vessel, evi- 
dently indicates D. melanophrys, as suggested to me by Mr. Eidgway 
recently, and, if so, the range of that species will be extended to within 
about 1,0G0 miles west of Ca])e Mendocino, California, thus coming well 
within the limits of D. nigripes. 

71. Fratercula corniculata (Naum.) Gray. 

81429 (3837) ad. 9 . St. Mathew Islaud, Bering Sea, Sept. 22, 1880. 
Abundant on the cliffs near Cape Upright, where they were inacces- 
sible except by shooting. They fairly cover the narrow ledges in com- 
pany with fulmars and kitti wakes. Colors of the fresh bird: Bill red 
and pale lemon, with narrow stripes of black in the grooves ; corners 
of mouth yellow ; iris white ; eyelids red ; palpebral appendages black ; 
feet and legs orange ; lighter on the upper surface of the toes and front 
of the feet ; worn and soiled so as to appear grayish on the under sur- 
face of feet and toes. 

The corners of the mouth are soft and 7iot callous. The palpebral ap- 
pendages are also soft.

At Port Altborp, on the 19th of June, 1880, 1 saw a dozen or more of 
these birds feeding in a small cove on George Island. They are very 
graceful in their movements. While feeding they put the head under 
the water and paddle along with it in that position— moving rather 
quickly. When one sees something in the water at a little distance 
he makes a rush for it, and others follow to get the prize. In alighting, 
after a short, rapid flight, they come down on the water with a tumble. 
One of their calls resembles the chipping of a sparrow, and I mistook it 
for that several times. They have a low whistle also. 

We found it very abundant in the harbor of St. Paul, Kodiak, July 
9 to 14, 1880.

coincident with reticulate tarsi, the latter shorter than the middle toe tcith 
claw. 

The i^receding marks combined appear to express the essential char- 
acters of the Cygnincc. By this dia.5>-nosis I follow Mr. SundevallI 
in excluding the genus Coscoroha Reichb., which has the lores feathered 
at all ages. As early even as Euppell's monograph of tlie genus 
Cygnus, (Mus. Senkenb. Ill), it was separated from the Swans. Here, 
however, it may be remarked, that this diagnosis refers only to the 
adult birds, because the young have the lores more or less downy or 
feathered, except in the genus Chenopis, which has the loral space 
naked at all ages. The removal of Coscoroha to the Anatimc will be 
discussed more explicitly below. The criterion " tarsi reticulate " further 
excludes the genera Cairina Flem. and Plcctropterns Leach, which, it 
is true, have the lores naked, but the tarsi of which are scutellate in- 
stead of reticulate. Anseranas Less, has certainly both naked lores and 
reticulate tarsi, but differs in having the tarsus longer than the middle 
toe with claw. 

Anatidce which do not at once unite all the above characters conse- 
quently belong to one of the other subfamilies. 

The whole ftimily Anatidw forms, as to structural features, a very 
homogeneous group, and intermediate links are everywhere to be found. 
Thus it is very difficult to define the subfamilies anatomically, and to 

"The present treatise comprises merely the ontlines of a monograph of the Swans, 
intended by the author to bo mnch more complete, but which liis departure for the 
Commander Islands prevented him from fini^shing according to the original plan. The 
paper contains so many valuable hints and so much important information upon this 
interesting group of birds, that it has been thought advisable to publish in it its pres- 
ent form, as preliminary to the more elaborate monograph contemplated by the au- 
thor after his return. — R. R.

give the structural differences by which they are to be separated, so 
that I find it not improbable that an exact investigation, based on a 
more abundant material than I can at present procure, will reduce the 
subfamilies to groups of lower rank. 

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBFAMILY. 

External characters. 

N^eck very long, as long as, or longer than, the body. Bill longer 
than the head, broad, and of nearly equal breadth for the whole length, 
rounded at the end, culmen high, depressed at the tip; nad rather 
large, only slightly arched; lamelhie of upper mandible vertical, in one 
row; nostrils situated nearly at the middle of the bill, in the fore part 
of the oblong nasal sinus. Lores naked in the adults ; iu all species, 
except one, thinly covered with small down or feathers in the young. 
Legs short, stout ; lower part of tibia naked; tarsi compressed, nuich 
shorter than the middle toe with the claw, and covered with small hex- 
agonal plates, the size of which diminishes laterally and posteriorly; the 
anterior toes reticulate as far as the second joint, then scutellate; mid- 
dle toe longest, longer than the tarsus, the outer longer than the inner, 
which has a broad margin; hind toe short, elevated, and without web,* 
the claws strong, arched, compressed except the middle, which is only 
compressed on the one side, the claw of the inner toe in old birds the 
largest and most arched. Wings long, ample, the inner remiges highly 
developed, with about 32 quills. Tail composed of 20-24 rectrices, 
short, rounded, or cuneate. 

Sexes similar. 

Os teo log tea I cha racters. 

The Swans, restricted as above, have a rather elongated skull, the 
intermaxillar portion being especially lengthened, but their cranium 
does not otherwise differ materially from that of the other Anati(la\ As 
a rule, however, the Cyynhiw lack the two apertures on the occiput just 
above the foramen tnarinum, which always are to be found in the other 
members of the tiimilyt as well circumscribed and often large foramina. 
The glandular depressions along the roof of the orbits are more or less 
well marked. They are rather distinct in the genus Cygnus, whereas 
they seem to be wanting in most of the other Anatidcc. 

The neck is extremely long, longer than the body, and is composed of 
the greatest number of vertehrce yet discovered in any recent bird, viz, 

*Tliis expression is not quite correct, for I have, iu the freshly-killed biril, always 
found a narrow, very slightly developed lobe. 

t One specimen of Cairina moschata (Lis. ), which I have examined, had no foutanelles. 
I have seen two skulls of Olor columbianus (Ord.) which presented corresponding open- 
ings, their limits, however, being lacerated and iu a state indicating that the ossifi- 
cation was not yet finished. The other crania of the same siiecies show no trace of 
these fontanelles.

from twenty-two to twenty-six. (The next in order are Coscoroha 
Candida having 21, and Branta canadensis with 20, and of birds belong- 
ing to other families, the long necked Plotns anliinga with 20 vertebnie 
colli, and Plioeni copter us ^ in which I have found only 18.) 

The number of the dorsal vertebra' amounts to eight, and consequently 
there are eight pairs of dorsal pleur apophyses, the first five usually sup- 
porting epipleural appendages. The three last have no uncinate processes 
as do likewise neither the two cervical ribs nor the sacral one. 

The body of the sternum is square, with the lateral margins quite 
l)arallel, and not narrower at the hind 
termination of the costal border, where 
the last dorsal rib articulates, as in the 
other Anatidce. (See figs. 1 and 2.) The 
hind border, with two fyroportionally 
shallow notches, their length makiiig as 
a rule about one-sixth of the greatest 
length of the sternum. The middle por- 
tion of the end of the sternum usually 
slightly sinuated. The crista sterni is 
rather high, but the carinal angle does 
not j)rotrude forward longer than the 
short manubrium, the fore border of the 
crista being more or less arched. In the one genus (Olor), the carina of 
which is shallow for the reception of a long fold of the windpi])e, the 
anterior margin consequently is double; in the other genera only a 
little concave. The lower limit of the crista is slightly curved. The 
greater portion of the lateral margin of the corpus sterni is occupied 
by the costal border, from which eight hwmapophyses ascend to meet the 
dorsal ribs, the free border behind being proportionately very short. 
The pectoral ridge on the body of the sternum, defining the origin of 
mttsculus pectoralis secundus, does not run 'parallel with the external 
margin or to the end of the keel, as is the case in the other Anatidce 
(figs. 3-5), but passes obliquely towards the middle, which it reaches 
before the termination of the crista. This feature, however, is not 
always equally marked. In one of the skeletons of the Olor columbianus 
which I have examined, the course has some resemblance to that of 
Coscoroba, not dismissing, however, its jjeculiar swanlike character. 

The clavicles form a broad, rather robust, U-shaped arch, except in 
the genus Olor, where the lower end is bent upwards and backwards 
to admit the fold of the trachea to enter the hollow keel of the breast 
bone. 

The coracoids are rather short and very stout bones. The scapula is 
proportionaUy short. 

The most marked feature in the osteology of the Swans, wherein 
they differ from the other members of the family, and which character- 
izes them as powerful flyers, seems to be the considerable length of 
the humerus and antibracliium, these being almost of equal length* 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 177 

When folded and lying close to the body their elbow -joint reaches far 
beyond the acetahulmn. Their length is greater than that of the hand, 
and considerably more than twice the tarsus. 

The 2)€ivis presents only few difi'erences from that of the other Ana- 
tidce. It is, however, proportionally louger and narrower, the breadth 
between the acetahula making only about one-fifth of the total length of 
the ilia. The very prominent ridges, forming the internal borders of 
the post-acetabular parts of the i/ia, run from the acetahula backward 
nearly parallel, the hinder sacral roof being rather narrow and of equal 




Spatula clypeata. — No. 1122, Ai-my Med. Mus. Nat. size. 

breadth, whereas in the other Anatidw, the ridges converge backwards 
from the more distant acetahula^ forming a wedge-shaped and rather 
flat and broad roof. The foramen ischiadicnm is rather large. 

The -pelvic limbs agree in every respect with those of the typical mem- 
bers of the family, except in the proportional length of the single bones 
mutually. 

The number of free caudal vertebra' is seven, to which is to be added 
the pygostyle. 

The Cygnince are more nearly related to the Anatinw than to the An- 
serine, the Coscoroba Eeichb. being among Ducks the genus most closely 
allied to the Swans. It has also, as stated above, usually been referred 
to the latter group, but an accurate examination undoubtedly shows 
that Coscoroba belongs to the Cygnince as little as does Cairina to the Anser- 
ince, and that Sundevall was right in removing it from the Swans. 
Proc. Nat. Mus. 82 12 July 25, 1 883. 



178 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Though both tlie exterior proportions and the color of the Coscoroha 
are much Uke those of the Swans, there are, however, considerable dif- 
ferences. 

In the first place, the bill is not of equal breadth for the whole length 
as in the Swans, but broadens, comparatively, considerably towards the 
tip, being, besides, more depressed in front of the nostrils, so that, on 
the whole, it is a perfect duck-bill. Add to this that the lores, at all 
ages, are comijletely feathered. The relation of the wing-feathers is 
nearly identical, but there is, however, a ditfereuce, the inner web of the 
third primary of Coscoroha not being sijiuated, as is the case in all species 
of Cygninw. The relatively inucli longer hind toe of Coscoroha is another 
not unimi)ortant difference, the whole nail touching the ground when 
the bird walks. 

The interior differences are even more essential. 

As I have just above given a short characteristic of the most inter- 
esting and peculiar facts in the osteology of the SwaTis, I here only in- 
tend to enumerate the more essential osteological features wherein Cos- 
coroha differs from the Cygnina', mostly leaving to the reader himself to 
draw the comparison. 

The sl:ull shows only few differences besides the above-mentioned pe- 
culiar sliape of the bill. The os lacrymale, however, is more duck-like 
than in the Swans, the fore processes Deing more elongated. On the oc- 




Pelvis of Coscoroha Candida.— I'fo. 11816, TJ. S. Nat. Mus. 

ciput the two fontanelles, above the foramen magnum, are to be found as 
well circumscribed, long, and rather narrow apertures (4 by 1.5'""'). The 
vertehrw colli amount to 21, the last supporting a free rib without epi- 
pleural appendage. Seven vertehrw of the dorsal section with their pleura- 
p)ophyses and hwmopojjJiyses, the five first having uncinate processes. One 
sacral rib. The number of free coccygeal vertehrw is only five plus the 
pygostyle. The sternum is quite duck-like in its outlines, the lateral mar- 
gins converging to the articulations of the last dorsal hmmapophyses, and 
from this jKjint again diverging. The costal horder is comparatively 
short. The notches of the hind margin very deep, making about ^ of 
the whole length of the sternum. The pectoral ridge for the origin of 
muse, pectoralis secundus runs backwards to the end of the crista, the 
lower border of which forms an undulating line, being higher ou the

fore portion; the carinal angle overhangs the mamihrium considerably; 

the fore border of the keel is sharp 

and rather straight. Most of these 

features will be well seen in fig. 4. 

The hracMum and antihracMum are 

of the same length, proportionally 

much shorter than in the Swans, their 

length being shorter than twice the 

tarsus, and only equal to the distance 

between the shoulder and hip joints. 

The j^cJvis is, as fig. G shows, quite 

typically duck-like. Compared with 

fig. 7, the pelvis of a swan, and with 

fig. 22, in Owens Anat. Vertebr., II, 

p. 32, representing a typical pelvis 

of a duck, the diflerences from the 

former and the identity with the latter 

are easily perceptible, the greatei 

breadth and wedge-shaped form ot 

the post-acetabular sacral roof being 

the most essential characters. 

In nearly all the above-mentioned 
features Coscoroha differs from the 
Swans, while the same characters 
draw it near to the true Ducks ; or, in 
other words, in nearly all the points 
wherein the Cygnimc differ from the 
Anatinw, the Coscoroha agrees with 
the latter. 

There can, after this, be no doubt fji 
where it, for the future, should be 
placed in the system.* 

It is, however, unquestionable that p^i.^^^ cyonu. gim,,.- 
the Swans, through Coscoroha, are Mus. 

more nearly allied to the Anatinw than they are to the Anserirue.

this statement refers only to the recent forms, because we, in reality, 
Lave a fossil species, whicli seems to be an intermediate link between the 
swans and geese. This form is the Cygmisfak'oneri Pakkek,* a gigantic 
swan from the Zebbug-Cave, Malta, nearly one-third larger than average 
individuals of the Mute Swan. It stood on longer legs, and had the 
comparatively short toes of a goose. In fact, the tarsi were consider- 
ably longer in proportion than those of the recent swans, the toes being 
very short, so that, whilst the proximal joint of the middle toe is one- 
fourth thicker than that of the Mute Swan, it is only three fourths the 
length. As this species evidently is generically quite distinct from any 
of the recent genera, I propose for it the name 

Paljeocycnus * Stejueger gen. nov. 

Type Palojocycrms falconeri. 

Fossil Swans have not been found longer back than the diluvium,

called "Kjolikenmoddings" of Denmark, and iu the leavings of the 
lake-dwellings of Switzerland the bones of Olor cygnus are found toler- 
ably common, and likewise from the peat-bogs of England. From 
Belgium, Prof. P. I. van Blueden has described a separate species as 
Cygnus JierenthalsU* from "une phalange du pied." 

The subfamily Cygnimc is at the present time considered to embrace 
nine recent .species, distributed in four different genera. 

This number is only one more than Ruppell already indicated in his 
monograph, but amongst the eight considered by him are enumerated 
Cairina moschata{Li^.) and Plectropterus riippelUi Sclat. {= gamhensis 
Rtipp. uec Linn.). Blainville gave, in Compt. Esnd. VII, 1838, pp. 
1022-1020, and Lesson, in Rev. Zool. 1839, pp. 321-324, an enumeration 
of the species belonging to the genus, also comprising eight, having, 
instead of the two last, adopted C. coscoroha (Mol.) and immutaMlis 
Yarr., whilst, however, they did not distinguish between hewickii 
Yaer. and columhianus (Ord). Eyton having published in 1838 his 
"Monograph of the Anatidaj" separates these, and thus makes species. 
SchleGtEL, in his synopsis of the genus (Mus. P.-B. 1866, VI, Anseres^ 
pp. 78-83) enumerates eight 8i)ecies. He, it is true, adopts also coscoroha 
(Mol.) as belonging to this genus; on the other hand, however, he does 
not recognize G. immutaMlis Yarr, as a distinct species. 

LiNNyEUS only described one species of Swan under the name of Anas 
cygnus, enumerating, however, the tame Swan among the synonyms as 
var. mansuetus; but in 1779 Pallas had already separated the latter 
specifically, and retained for it the title of cygnus, whilst the Hooper re- 
ceived the name olor. 

Molina, in 1782, described the Chilian Swan as Anas melaneorypha. 

In 1788 Gmelin described nigricolUs after Bougainville and me- 
lanocej)hala after Molina. In the mean time, as these two are synony- 
mous with Molina's melaneorypha, the number of species known at that 
time amounted still to only three. 

In 1790 Latham described atratus. In the same year it was described 
by Bonnaterre under the name of Anser Kovoe-Hollandice. 

Lewis and Clarke, in their "Travels" (1814), separated the Ameri- 
can Swan, which Ord, in the second American edition of Guthrie's 
Geography iu the following year (1815), gave the systematic name Anas 
colimibianus, thus making the fifth species. 

In 1830 Yarrell described Cygnus bewicMi as new, by which the 
number of species was increased to six. In the same year Breiim in- 
dicated C, islandicus as a supx)osed new species, which, however, is only 
a synonym of Olor cygnus. 

The seventh species was added in the following year (1831) by Rich- 
ardson, viz: C. buccinator from ISTorth America. 

The eighth dates from the year 1S38, when Yarrell introduced C. 
immutaMlis into the system.

1S2 PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Three Swans, which vou Pelzeln iu 18G2 described as belonging to 
immutaMlis, are in the present work introduced under C. iimcini, a spe- 
cies which Hume founded iu 1871 on two immature specimens, and 
which has usually been regarded as the young of C. gibhiis Bechst. 
Thus we at preseut allow nine species of Swans. 

The C.passmori, described by Hincks in 1805, seems only to be a young 
huccinator. Gijgnus davidi, which was described by Swinhoe in 1870, 
does not belong to the Swans, but to the genus Coscoroha Eeichb. 
amongst the Anathuc. (See p. 180.) 

Until Bechstein in 1803 indicated the genus Cygnus, the species be- 
longing to this group were referred to the great Linn^AN genus Anas. 
The new genus was soon commonly adopted, and remained undivided 
until 1832, when Waglek* divided it into three, viz : Chcno^ns, Olor, 
and Cygrms. 

At first I was inclined to regard all the Swans as belonging to only 
one genus. But since Prof. Theo. Gill has drawn my attention to 
several differences in the structure I have convinced myself that the 
genera in question are as well founded as a greater part of genera among 
the A^iatidw, which I never hesitated to admit. If one would adopt the 
view of Mr. Seebohm,! that the color is the most important generic 
criterion, only two genera ought to be established, the one white and 
the other black ; but the greatest ditferences are even to be found be- 
tween the white species, this fact, for one, showing the untenabiiity of 
Mr. Seebohm's standpoint. The color can indicate where the limits of 
a genus are to be drawn, and may in many cases be of great value as 
instruction when the matter is doubtful, or may also add an important 
character to the other ones, but it ought not to be the only or even the 
main character of a genus, which should merely be based upon struct- 
ural marks. 

In the matter now before us it will, however, be seen that if we admit 
any subdivision of the genus, the black-necked Swan must be separated 
from the Pala?arctic knob-billed Swan {Cygnus gihhus) and its congeners 
to obtain equivalency with the different groups.J I therefore propose 
the new genus ISthenelus, the number of recent genera thus being four. 
For the fossil C.falconerl I have introduced a fifth genus, Palaeocycnus. 

SYNOPSIS OF THE GENERA. 

o'. Predominant color of the adults wbite; young with do^ny or feathered lores; ter- 
tiaries and scapulars uoroial, not crisi^; tail longer than the middle toe 
"with claw. 

• Eearlier than this BoiE had asserted the necessity of this divisou (Oken's Isis 1822, 
p. 564, nat). 

tCat. Birds Brit. Mus., vol. v, p. viii : "These so-called structural characters have 
no generic value at all." (!) 

tREiCHKNBACH, in his Naturg. Vog. Neuholl, p. 343, expresses the same opinion, 
nowhere, however, as far as I cau detect, giving a name.

Geographical distribution. 

The Cygmme appear both in the northern and the southern hemi- 
spheres as extra-tropical birds, no representatives of these large Lamelli- 
rostris being found within the tropics. They are consequently wanting 
both in the Indo-African Tropical — they do not at all breed in Africa — 
and in the American Tropical Eegion, only one species being met with 
in the South American Temperate and one in the Australian Eegion. 
The remaining seven species occur in the Arctic and the North Temper- 
ate Regions, the greatest number, viz, five, being found in the Old World, 
and here they only extend their winter migrations to the two southern 
provinces, the Mediterranean and the Manchurian, without breeuing 
there. The two ISTorth American species only breed within the Ameri- 
can division of the Arctic Region. 

The following table gives a synopsis of their distribution:

with white nail, and intense rose-red. Iris is said to be brown or almost 
black. The legs are, in the skin, light brownish; in the live bird, pale 
flesh color. 

Tbe head and the upper two-thirds of the neck are of a beautiful 
blackish-brown color, with velvet gloss; a narrow white stripe sur- 
rounds the eye, from the hind angle of which it extends backward into 
the nape, but without meeting the stripe from the other side. On the 
chin a large white spot. The whole remaining plumage is pure white.

The bill, which does not show the slightest trace of a frontal knob, is, 
in the dried condition, dark yellowish-red at the base, gradually chang- 
ing into dark brownish towards the tip ; the nail light yellowish. Legs 
light yellowish gray, with darker webs. 

The plumage is white with pale rusty edges on each feather, this 
tinge being most intense on the upper parts. The head and the upper 
two-thirds of the neck, as in the adult described above; the brown, 
however, being considerably lighter. The limit of the feathering round 
the base of the bill very light, becoming almost white round the eye 
and on the chin, on which the light color forms a rather large spot; 
from the hind angle of each eye the white stripe extends backward, 
nearly meeting its fellow on the median line of the nai)e. The prima- 
ries are white, the tips broadly edged with dark chocolate-brown on the 
outer five, becoming narrower and fainter on the following quills; in 
the former, the colored edge is about 20™™ broad at the tips, tapering 
towards the base on both webs, and becoming first obsolete on the outer 
web; the shafts of the outer quills are brown for the most part, gradu- 
ally decreasing towards the innermost, the shafts of which are almost 
white to the very tip. The primary coverts are also more or less marked 
with brown shadings on the tips of the webs and shafts.

coming almost white above towards the limit of the white part of the 
neck. Besides, the middle tail feathers are brownish gray on the inner 
web tOAvards the tip; this color on the outer ones also extending into 
the outer web, which, however, is edged with white to the very tip; the 
shafts are brown.

This species has usually been called Cygnus olor (Gmel. nee Pall. 
1811). But, as will be shown below, Pallas has given the name Anas 
olor to the Hooper long before Gmelin compiled his Systema, Naturalis, 
for which reason the name of the latter must be suppressed for the 
present species. The matter stands as follows: Pallas, in 1779, in 
the introduction to a treatise on Anas glocitans (Sv. Yetensk. Acad. 
Handl. XL, p. 2G-27), says as follows: . . , "Duck-genus [Anas) 
. . . most kinds occur very generally both in Europe, Asia, and 
America, but not in the Tropics. Thus also ..." the Swan is to be

foimd, not only that wbicli is rigiitly called Cygmis, wliicli lias a lioarse 
and hissing voice, but also the OJor, which the newest zoologists hesi- 
tate over, and which has a clear and i)leasant voice, which can be heard 
far; it ought thus to belong to a different species." In a foot-note he 
adds: "I mean here the so-called C^r/wMs/er^ts, . . . which . . • 
really is a distinct species from the so-called Cygmis mansuetnsy He 
gives the name clearly, in a scientific and highly distinguished journal, 
which, at that time, was widely spread over everywhere where the 
science of natural history was cultivated, and four years after the 
above-quoted remarks were translated into German (Schwed. Abhaudl. 
Uebersetzt von A. G. Kiistner, 41 vol. p. 23, Leipzic, 1783). He urges 
repeatedly that the same species (in opposition to Linnaeus, who had 
only distinguished between the two Swans as the wild and the tame 
state of the same species) must be separated, and his indication of 
which kind he means is fully unmistakable. By this he has fulfilled 
all demands by adopting a name given by an author. In this case it is 
not less than nine years older than Gimelin's. But of his errors, the 
same applies to this as to many others — that science must not allow 
itself to be bound by them, even if it should cause the greatest difficul- 
ties to rectify the mistake. 

Among the synonyms of this species Mr. Dresser (Birds of Eur.) 
cites ^^Anas {Cygmis) mmisuetus, Lath. Gen. Synopsis, Suppl. p. 297 
(1787)." This quotation is not correct, and can be misapprehended, as 
if Latham had given the name mansuetns as a specific one, but he 
only writes —

Cygnus immutahilis Yare. 
Polish Swan.* 

DiAGN. — Culmen until a smaller Jcnoh at the base; legs in the aclulls 
slate-gray or yellowish gray ; young white ^ icith the bill light pinMsh red. 

Syn. — 1838.— Cygmis immutahilis Yarr., Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1838, p. 19 (nee v. Pelz, 
18(i2, quse C. unwini Hume), 

Since Yarrell, in 1838, described this species, but few contributions 
to the ehicidation of the questions concerning its habitat and its rela- 
tion to C. gibbus have been made. The time was when its right as a 
species was generally denied, essentially for the reason that a few in- 
stances of mixed broods with both white and gray cygnets were stated 
to have occurred. But at present, the opinion being inclined to regard 
such a case as "the result of an alliance between a Mute and a Polish 
Swan," the distinction of these two species seems to be generally ad- 
nntted — at least in England. The various investigations about this 
question are described at great length, and important new observa- 
tions given, by Mr. Dresser in his Birds of Europe, Parts Ixxvii, 
Ixxviii, and Ixxix, April, 1880, but not even he has answered the in- 
quiry as to the true habitat of the immutabilis. At first I regarded 
it as an eastern form, confounding it with G. unwini; but I have now 
convinced myself that the latter constitutes a different species, and I 
am inclined to believe that the English immutahilis will show itself to 
be a western bird. Specimens can easily be overlooked, and a few may, 
perhaps, be found in one or another of the European museums (as, for 
instance, the example in Mus. Leiden.), but I see no reason why it should 
be supposed that the ornithologists of the continent have been less ex- 
act in this case than those of England. I therefore regard the species 
as being very scarce on the European continent; the only specimen 
from there was killed in Holland, just opposite to England, in which 
latter country it seems to be not even rare. 

Blainville has already questioned whether the immutabilis is not 
the wild form of the Tame Swan, and we see that Mr. Dresser for a 
long time also was inclined to indorse the same view, which, however, 
my investigations most positively contradict, it appears to me that 
the question, with more right, could be asked conversely, viz, whether 
the Polish Swan is not a race originated by domestication ; but even 
this seems not to be the case, as it appears from the quotation in Mr. 
Dresser's Birds of Eur. (1. c.) of the experiences of Mr. SmpsoN, "who 
had from seventy to a hundred cygnets through his hands yearly for 
the past thirty years, and who never saw a white one," and f.om the 
statement of Mr. Dresser himself, that the Changeless Swan, " so far 

*Not "Polar Swjiu (Cygne du Pole)" as Blainville, Compt. Reud. VII, 1838, p. 
1024, and after him Degl. «fe Gerbe, Ornith. Eur. II, p. 477, indicates. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 193 

as he can ascertain, has only been recorded in a wild state from the 
shores of Great Britain."* Should it, after all, be an absurd supposition 
that immutabilis is the indigenous wild English Swan, while gibbus is 
inctigenous only to the continent, but introduced, in a half domesticated 
state, to England during the time of Richard I"? 

This Swan presents the peculiar fact that the young of it are better 
distinguishable from its nearest allies than the adults of both species 
in their perfect plumage. This is, however, no objection to its right to 
be considered a species any more than in the case of two other species, 
the plumages of whose young are quite alike. 

The most conspicuous distinctive mark of the two species is that the 
young (in down and in the first plumage) of immutabilis are white, and 
not gray or brownish, as in gibbus. They are, however, not pure white, 
at least not always, as they were described as being on the back more 
or less tinged with warm bufl*. 

They differ also in the color of the bill, this being pale pinkish red in 
the young immntahiUs and i^lumbeous in gibbus. It cannot here be ob- 
jected that the Mute Swan in the later youth also has the bill of a sim- 
ilar color, as it, during the transition to the white plumage, begins to 
take a reddish tone, because the mentioned red color on the bill of the 
young Polish Swan is to be found already in the first summer simul- 
taneous with the first feathers, as is evident from Mr. Soutwell's 
(Dresser 1. c.) description of the plumage of three young the 20th of 
August: "They had then assumed nearly all their feathers and were 
more than half grown ; the color was white, apparently stained or sul- 
lied by a yellowish tint, which was strongest on the wing-coverts; feet 
pale ash-color, and beak a purplish flesh-color, differing entirelj^ from 
the lead-color of the bill in the young Mute Swan of the same age." 
Also the color of the bill of the adult birds is diftereut, the Polish Swan 
having it rather redder than the continental species. 

The frontal knob is said to be smaller in immutabilis at all ages. It 
is, however, present also in the quite young, as is evident from Mr. 
Dresser's plate, fig. 2. The eye and the lamella, too, are said to be 
smaller. 

The character now to be mentioned belongs only to the adult birds. 
In the adult gibbus the legs are jet-black, sometimes with a shade of red 
shining through the black color; in immutabilis their color is variously 
stated to be from pale j)! mbeous or slate-gray to a light drab color. 
This latter color they had in the specimen examined by me. In the 
young the color of the feet is nearly the same in the two species, and it 

*I8 the statement, p. 4, about the captures of immutabilis in NorfolTc, enumerated by 
Mr. Stevknson, contrary to this? He says: "Some, at least, if not most of these, 
however, were undoubtedly birds Avhich had straggled from other waters, aud not 
genuine wild birds." I cannot plainly see if these words are the refiectious of Mr.

is expressly stated "that at no stage of growth is this a character to be 
depended upon." 

In their size they seem not to differ. Mr. Dresser gives the total 
length of the adult male of gihhus at about four and a half to five feet, 
the gape 3.55 inches, and the tarsus 4.5 inches ; and of the adult immu- 
lahiUs, respectively at about five feet, 3.6, and 4.25 inches. The differ- 
ences in the length of the wing, 27 inches as against 23.5, and yet more 
in the length of the tail, 10 to 6.8, are certainly quite considerable, but 
not more shan sometimes occurs in the same species, especially as it is 
probable that the feathers of the specimen from North-Repps are not fully 
developed. 

Finally, there are the osteological differences described by Mr. Pel- 
ERIN (Mag. Nat. Hist., 1839, p. 178), which I have had no occasion to 
verify, and which I cannot remember to have seen confirmed or denied 
by any other thar Mr. Yarrell himself. 

The English ornithologists may after this be right when they urge the 
independence of C. immiitabilis, and it should be a great offense against 
the science if one would unite these two forms and hereby cut off", or at 
least trouble, the study of this particular phenomenon. 

As far as my investigations go, they also agree with the results of the 
English authors. In Schlegel's Catal. Mus. P.-B., YI, Anseres, p. 79, 
a male "de I'ann^e" is enumerated under Cygnus olor (Gmel.) as 
killed on the Lake of Haarlem in the month of December, 1840. The 
description of this interesting specimen, which certainly belongs to C. 
immutahilis Yarr., is as follows : 

Mus. Leiden, C olor No. 3 (<?, Lalce of Haarlem, Holland, December, 
1840). 

Length of the bill along the gape, 102""' ; from the tip to the fore 
border of the nostrils 60, and to the eye 131'"'". Length of toes with 
claws: Outer toe 139, middle toe 145, inner toe 112, and hind toe 30'""\ 
Tarsus 95, tail 158, and wing 565'""'- The distance from the tip of the 
bill to the fore border of the knob 82""", the knob itself being 6'"'" high. 

The whole plumage pure white, with a faint rose-colored shade on the 
•wing-coverts, and a rust-colored tinge on the crown and chin. The tar- 
sus and toes yellowish-gray, the webs grayish-yellow. The original color 
of the bill cannot be recognized in the dried specimen. 

If one compare the above dimensions with those given on Table IV, it 
will be seen that they agree quite well with the smallest specimen. The 
small size of the frontal knob, and the remarkably light feet, are very 
characteristic features, combined with the white plumage. I therefore 
regard the identification of this specimen with G. immutahilis to be un- 
questionable. 

As to the colors of the young, I refer to the descriptions given above.

Note 1 to the synonymy. — Dkesser cites Hermann's Anas dircwa as 
belonging to immutabiUs Yarr. with a query. Because the descri])tioa 
of the said author contains the phrase "corpore ciwereo" I regard tliis 
reference unadvisable. The resembLance of the title Cygnus polonicus^ 
cited by Hermann, and the English name, "Polish Swau," is of no 
consequence for the reason that such a title is not to be found in 
Gesner, in spite of the quotation.* It belongs rather to the species 
here in question, but the phrase ^'rostro rubro''^ makes me hesitate, 
because I am not satisfied whether the young of this species has a red 
bill or not. From the description of Hume it seems that it should not 
be the case. Hermann does not speak about the knob, it is true, but 
if it had been completely absent he should not have failed to mention 
it. I have therefore introduced it into the above synonymy with some 
doubt. 

Note 2. — The museum at Vienna received in the year 1857 three adult 
swans which Mr. Zelebor had captured in the month of March the 
foregoing year, and which had been deposited in the imperial menagerie 
at Schonbrunn, near Vienna, where they died in the beginning of the 
said year. Misled by the statement that white and gray cygnets had 
been found in the same brood, Mr. A. v. Pelzeln, in a short article 
(1. c), identified the specimens with the C. immutahiUs Yarr. 

Mr. A. V. Pelzeln has had the great courtesy to send one of the 
specimens a great distance for my inspection, and I am thus enabled to 
make up my own ojiinion. 

As fiir as I can judge the specimens in question are distinct from both 
the gibbus and the immutabiUs. From both these species they are sep- 
arated by the complete absence of even the slightest trace of a tubercle 
or knob, by their inferior size, and by the different form of the bill. 
From the former, with which they agree in having the plumage of the 
young brownish, they are further distinguishable by the legs and webs, 
which are "slate-colored, changing into olive," and from the latter by 
having a brownish and not white plumage of the young. 

'' Hermann quotes: Gesner, Edit. Francof. 1604, p. 273 B: but on p. 373 B (on p. 273 
lie treats of Ciconia) lie only says: "1h Polonia cygni sunt divcrsi generis; sunt enim alij 
feri, 2)ari magnitudine, alij domcstici, quoi'um vox suavis est, ij- tuba refert." 



196 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES XATIOXAL MUSEUM. 

lu 1871 Mr. A. O. Hume described two yoiiug swans from Iu;lia un- 
der the name C. tmicini, which I consider not to be identical with the 
gibbiis, as is the general opinion, for the following reason: 

They are said to have not the fixintest trace of a tubercle. The young 
of the common Mute Swan get their knob very early, as soon as they 
have been full feathered. The fact that the female has a smaller and 
more indistinct knob is of no consequence, while Hume had before him 
both male and female. They were, too, full grown, ready to take the 
white plumage in the first spring, and in this age the young gibhus has 
a very distinct knob, even in the female sex. 

Nor can these birds be identified with the immutabiUs Yarr., the 
total absence of the knob and the brownish ])lumage being invincible 
obstacles. 

On the other hand, the description in these points agrees very well 
with the above-mentioned birds from Egypt. The following description 
is by Hume: "From the frontal feathers to beyond the end of the nasal 
fossa, a distance of very nearly 1^ inch, the culmen is a perfectly straight 
line. Beyond this there is a very shallow concavity to the posterior 
margin of the nail." 

To the foregoing five specimens I add a sixth, which agrees in the 
eastern habitat, the absence of the tubercle, and the apparently dark 
young plumage, viz: the bird, w^hich C. A. Wright mentions (Ibis, 
1874, p. 241), as follows: "There is an example of C. olor in the Malta 
University INIuseum nearly pure white, but with scarcely any appear- 
ance of the frontal knob." 

The Polish Swans, indicated to have been found in Corfu and Epirus 
(Ibis, 1860, p. 351, and 1870, p. 338), probably may also belong to the 
species here in question.

iug extension : The naked skin between the base of the bill and the eye ; 
further, a large si)ot S'"'" long, on the culmen adjacent to the frontal 
feathers, and connected with the black loral space by a small black 
stripe; besides, the whole skin covering the nasal cavity is black, sur- 
rounded by the red-bill color; finally, the nail both on the upper and 
lower mandible with the edges of both jaws. " The legs and webs are 
not black, but slate-colored, changing into olive" (v. Pelzeln). 

Plumage pure white with a few brownish feathers here and there, the 
remains of the young plumage. 

For the sake of completeness, I here give the main points of Mr. 
Hume's description of the coloration of the young. 

( (? and 9 jun. Juhbee stream, on the borders of the Hazara and Ka- 
undpindes districts, India. — 11th January, 1871. — By Capt. Unwin.) 

"If from each side of the frontal tongue of feathers, about half an 
inch from its point, a. slightly curving line be drawn to a point on the 
edge of the upper mandible about a quarter of an inch from the gape, 
the whole of the space inclosed by such line between it and the eye is 
perfectly black. At the extreme point of the frontal feathers, again, is 
a black band about a quarter of an inch wide, which extends right and 
left over the whole narial space. The nail is black; the rest of the bill 
was light gray. The legs and feet, I may add, were grayish black. 

"The general color of the lower surface is a dull white; of the upper 
whitey -brown. The crown and occiput wood-brown; the greater por- 
tion of the wing, the scapulars, and rump are \vood or sandy brown. 
There is nowhere any trace of a ' sooty gray.' The brown is essentially 
a buffy or sandy brown, though here and there, as in the feathers of the 
base of the neck, a faint grayish shade is intermingled. 

"Both male and female, though diflering somewhat in size, are pre- 
cisely similar both as regards plumage and coloration of the bill." 

I am aware that of late there have been published two or three papers 
about the Indian Swans in " Stray Feathers," and in the "Journal of 
the Asiatic Society of Bengal," but as I have not been able to pro- 
cure any of them, I cannot say whether they have any influence on the 
question discussed above. If they really prove that Capt. Unwin's 
young birds belong to Cygnus gibMs, I would propose that the present 
species, which certainly at all events is distinct from the Knob-Swan, 
should be called Cygnus pelzelni.

Gmel. 1783) has been thus quoted. But the name of Pallas has, 
without doubt, the priority in this species, as I have shown above (p. 189), 
for which both Bechstein's name for this and Gmelin's olor must give 
way, and I cannot see but that the authors, who only admit one genus 
of Swans, viz, Cygrms, must adopt the name of Pallas as the oldest 
for the present species. It is certainly a serious matter to transfer the 
name, which the Mute Swan has borne so long, to the Hooper, but if 
we consider the right of priority, there is nothing else to be done. In 
this case it does not depend upon a question which can be disputed, 
how the old authors' descriptions can be interpreted (as, for examj)le, 
with Sterna Mr undo and Stercorarius parasiticus). [See the note under 
Cygnus gibbus.]

species is found to be separated from the common Hooper, but only as 
variety "/5 minor'''' nnder Cygnus olor A In 1840 Keyseeling aud 
Blasius altered the name j^iven by Pallas to a binominal, and called 
the species minor ; but already, 10 years earlier,^ Yaerell had described 
it under the name bewicMi. The same year Breiim, in Isis, had named 
a little Swan as islandicus, but after what I have tried to show, in my 
second note on the synonymy, it does not belong here, bnt to the 
Hooper, whilst the species described and well drawn by Naumann in 
Wiegmann's Archiv. 1838, under Beehm's name islandicus certaiuly 
belougs to bewickii; he altered the name 4 years later to melanorhinus. 
In Naumannia for the year 1854, p. 145, Taf. I and II, Professor Altum 
described and delineated a little Swan after specimens killed in North- 
western Germany, and which he considered to be a new species, difler- 
ent from bewickii, but without giving it a name, and whose principal 



*GiEBEL, Thesaur. Ornith. I, cites, "Wiegm. Areh. IV, 1838, p. 361, Taf. 9," and 
Dresser, B. of Eur., has the same quotation. 

t Althougli Pallas's description in the above-named place only partly refers to C. 
hewickii, it will not do to place his name as unconditionally synonymous with the 
Hooper, as Mr. Finsch does (Verb. Zool.-Bot. Ver. Wien XXXIX, 1879, p. 255). 

t A specimen was killed in France in 1807, and was deposited in the museum at 
Leiden under the name Cygnus musicus, until I, the last summer, identified it with 
heivitJcii. 



202 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

character consisted in the unmixed black color of the whole culmen. 
During the discussion which followed, the name Altum's Swan was 
occasionally employed to indicate the specimens described by him, and 
hence probably " Cygntis altumW originated. 

Note 2.— Mr, Dresser indicates the year of publication of Yarrell's 
name to be 1833, probably because the volume of the "Transactions" in 
question bears that date on the title-page. But the part in which 
Yarrell's treatise was ])rinted was published in 1830. Besides, Mr. 
Dresser quotes "p. 445," which also is that on which the treatise be- 
gins, but the name and the diagnosis first occur on p. 453. 

j^ote 3. — Prof. J. Eeinhardt has already made a statement* which, 
strauge to say, has generally been overlooked, to the effect that C. 
L. Brehm's Gygnus islandicus is not synonymous with the species in 
question. His description in Oken's Isis, 1830, p. 1135, and in Handb. 
Vog. Deutschl. 1831, p. 832, contains nothing on which the identity can 
be founded, with the exception that the Iceland Swan was smaller, 
"frequently G inches shorter," than the Hooper. Besides, the shape of 
the bill of the two supposed species was indicated to be different, but 
not in such a manner that anything about the present question is to be 
concluded from this. It is highly improbable that Brehm could really 
have a G. heividcii before him without taking notice of the difference 
between the extension of the yellow on the beak. The matter will be 
found to be quite certain when we look at the drawing in his Handb. 
Yog. Deutschl., pi. xli, fig. 1, which, according to p. 1035, is meant to 
represent C. islandicus. Though drawn by Goetz, and belonging to 
the class of unlucky representations, it still unmistakably shows the 
extension of the yellow color, both in the upper and the lower mandi- 
ble, precisely as in the Hooper, viz, the yellow color is carried to a 
point under the nostrils, and Brehm expressly assures us that all the 
figures are drawn from nature. Neither can it be pleaded as a proof 
against the opinion here expressed that Iceland is stated as the habitat 
after it is known that (7. hewicldi has never been seen there. Neither 
do Brehm's small specimens allow themselves to be referred to as any 
pigmy variety of the Hooper. Prof. J. Eeinhardt, in Copenhagen, 
has, at all events, kindly informed me that those Swans occurring in 
Iceland cannot be separated from those of the continent on account of 
smaller size.t Here it must be remarked that the so-called consider- 
able difference in size, viz, "6 inches," is not especially extraordinary. 
The difference between the largest and smallest individuals of the lat- 
ter species which I have measured (except an unusually small speci- 
men from Greenland) amounts to 5 inches.

X Personally I liave had no opportunity of examining skins of specimens from Ice- 
land. In the mean time this aft'air ought to be very closely examined. I refer here 
to the remarkably small si^ecimen of the Hooper from Greenland, included in the table 
of dimensions on p. 202. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSUEM. 203 

BOLLiNG's " Ornithologia Danica" represents undoubtedly a C. heiciclii, 
although that on the i^late is called musicus, and although the author 
in the text under the latter species refers to the same represeutation. 
The yellow color on the beak has in fact precisely the peculiar limit of 
that in hewickii. 

Note 5. — In riCDLEGEL's Mus. P.-B. Ameres^ p. 82, and in Degland 
and Gerbe's Ornith. Europ. II, p. 474 (probably on his authority), as 
synonymous with the sui^posed species, Cygnus altumii,* Badeker is 
stated, without date and without naming the place from which the quo- 
tation is taken. In Bonaparte's Cat. Ois. Eur. Parzudaki, 1858, in 
Severzow's "Turkistanskie Jevotnie," 1873, and again in Mr. Dres- 
ser's translation of the same in the Ibis, 1876, j). 410, also in Cab. Journ. 
Ornith. 1875, j). 184, the name Cygnus altiimi occurs, but with the 
author's name, Homeyer, added. Mr. E. v. Homeyeb has in the 
meantime had the kindness to inform me as follows: "Neither I nor 
any of my friends in Berlin have any knowledge that Badeker has 
anywhere spoken of a C. altumii. Neither have I ever done so. ... I 
repeat that t have never spoken about G. alUimii, and do not know how 
Severzow can have quoted me." Prof. B. Altum writes to me that 
the Swan described by him in Naumannia IV, p. 145, Badeker has 
had figured with the name in question. He can, however, neither give 
place nor date.

From the base forward to between the nostrils and the nail, the bill 
on the unskiuned bird was tiesh-colored (Mr. Storm, I. c. and i)i litt.). 
The red color in the dried condition has now exactly the same extent, 
but has changed to a dull yellowish-red in the hinder part and dark 
crimson in the front part; border, tip, and a spot round the opening of 
the nostrils, black. Mr. Storm describes the feet in the freshly-killed 
specimen as grayish, lighter than in the adult, and the iris as light 
grayish. 

The upper part of the head and neck dull bluish-gray, with the edges 
of the feathers on the head lighter ; chin and throat dirty-Avhite; fore- 
head partly with rather strong rusty -yellow tinge; round the eyes a 
sharply-defined, downy, white ring. Eest of the surface of the body 
light violet-gray, with the edges of the feathers tawny yellow ; on the 
back, shouhlers, wing-coverts, sides, and the rather purer light bluish- 
gray rump, the shafts are blackish, forming very distinct dark streaks; 
on each shoulder a pure white feather protrudes, with a few gray rays. 
The underside whitish, with the edges of the feathers rust-colored, 
especially on the middle of the belly ; crissum shaded with dull grayish. 
The primaries a trifle darker than the back, the first with a white stripe 
in the outer web, along the shaft ; tlie primary coverts rather light. Rec- 
trices gray, lighter along the edge of the inner web; a cluster of the 
outer tail-coverts on each side pure white. 

The tail consists of 20 rectrices.*

Lores almost bare, and the light color on those and the bill yellow. 
This color extends along the edge of the upper mandible not farther 
than is usual in the adult birds, whilst that on the culmen reaches as 
far as the fore border of the nostrils; likewise the hinder part of the 
skin of the nostrils is yellow. On the culmen, straight up from the 
upper posterior point of the skin of the nostrils, a large horseshoe- 
shaped black spot, with the opening towards the back. The limits be- 
tween black and yellow less distinct than in the adult. 

The color of the plumage about the same as that of the young speci- 
men in the collection at Trondhjem, described above, although not so 
bluish; the tint on the back, wings, and tail feathers being, on the con- 
trary, brownish. Also, the shafts are light, except on the remiges and 
rectrices, the shafts of which are brownish. The forehead and the abdo- 
men with rusty -yellow tinge.

the nostrils 14, and to the anterior angle of the eye 36™". Breadth of

Color of the bill, brownish, with whitish nail. Legs yellowish-gray. 

The down on the upper surface has a distinct tinge of brownish on 
the white ground, this tinge changing into a lighter tone on the under- 
side of the neck, while it forms a very well defined limit against the 
white on the rest of the under surface. 

This specimen is admitted to the j^resent species with doubt. Per- 
haps it may belong to 0. cygrius ; but the proportionately great height 
of the bill at the base, and the positron of the nostrils parallel to the 
commissure and not to the culmen, seem to indicate it to be a true 
^hewiclcii. 

Bewick's Swan has often been confounded with both the Hooper 
and 0. columbianus^ and even quite recently doubts about the difference 
from the first mentioned have been stated; whilst the erroneous identi- 
fication of columhianUs with hewicMi has caused the impression that the 
latter is to be found in the Nearctic region. 

When once attention has been drawn to the difference between the 
adult Hooper and the adult hewicku, it is almost impossible after- 
wards to make a mistake between them, as one, only from the color 
of the beak, will be able to distinguish them from each other, apart 
from the size and structural differences, which will be spoken of later. 
In the Hooper, the yellow color on the bill and lores embraces really a 
larger surface than the black, and reaches, even on the jaw, in a pointed 
angle to under and in front of the nostrils, whilst that in the bewiclcii 
only embraces about one-third of the surface of the bill aud lores, as also 
that in the latter ends in a curved line behind the nostrils, without 
reaching them. On some individuals one sees a very little portion or 
spot of the yellow, stretching itself on to the skin of the nostrils, where 
it occasionally is said to extend in a narrow stripe to the hind border of 
the opening of the nostrils, but on the jaw itself the yellow color does 
not reach by a long way near the opening of the nostrils. The men- 
tioned relation concerning the extent of the yellow on the skin of the 
nostrils I have most frequently observed on specimens from Denmark. 

As is clearly shown by a comparison of the measurements given in 
Tables Y and VI, the difference in size alone is sufficient to separate the 
adult birds of both species from each other. 

With regard to the adults there is thus no difficulty. On the con- 
trary, it is not always so easy to distinguish the young birds of the two 
species from each other, as in them the given distinctions in the color of 
the bill and the size do not always hold good. Dr. O. FmscH thinks, 
after having spoken about the mentioned difficulties, which for him even 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 207 



appear to raise doubts about tlie specific value of hewicMi* (Yerli. Zool. 

Bot. Ver. Wien, 1879, p. 256), that " only the shorter tarsus and middle 

toe can be given as distinctions"; but 

even this mark cannot be employed with 

individuals that have not yet reached 

their full size. I have therefore looked 

about after another distinctive mark, 

and believe I have found one, which is 

characteristic in all ages. I* 

What there is most peculiar in 0. he- 1 

wicMi, when comi^ared with the Hooper, § 

is without doubt the higher and rather s" 

shorter form of the bill, and on the whole 

the bill is that part in which we can 

expect to find the most essential char- 
acters in these birds. 

I have had the beaks of two full- 
grown young birds, in gray plumage, 

photographed, the one of Bewick's, 

the other of the Hooper, so that the 
former, in order to be more easily com- 
pared, is so much enlarged that it has 
obtained exactly the same size as the o 
latter. Figs. 15 and IG are taken very | 
carefully after these photographs. I 

If one takes the distances from the |i 
tip of the bill to the hind border of the |' 
nostrils, and from this point again to 
the mouth, in the one figure, between 
the feet of the dividers, and places these 
measurements on the other figure, it 
will be very easy to convince oneself 
that the nostrils in bewicMi lie nearer 
the tip of the bill than in the Hooper, 
which can also be expressed thus, viz, 
that in the Hooper the distance from the mouth to the hind border of 
the nostrils is equal to the distance between this and the hind border 
of the nail of the bill, whilst in hewiekn the former distance is equal to 
that between the hind border of the nostrils and a point on the middle 




*When Dr. Finsch, ], c, in his comparative table of the dimensious, quotes *lie 
measurements of Professor Schlkgel, and thereby makes out that the difference in size 
between cygnus and hewickii is only slight, it should not be forgotten that one of the 
specimens which Professor Schlegel measures as ctignus is only a female of hewicUi, 
and, moreover, a very small one, too, as is fully evident from my table. 

The mistake of Professor Schlegel is the more strange frojii -the fact that he in his 
catalogue (p. 81) expressly adverts to the peculiar extension of the yellow color on 
the biU being exactly that of the typical hewickii. 



208 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

of tlie nail. It will further be easily seen in the same figure that a 
straight line laid along the upper border of the nostrils in the Hooper 
will go almost parallel with the culmen, whilst this in Bewick's Swan 
will form a much more obtuse angle with the same.* 

It will not be diflBcult in general in these birds to notice through the 
skin of the bill the outlines of the bones which lie underneath. Espec- 
ially easy will one be able to discern the outlines of the processus 
maxiUaris of the nasal bone with the open angle lying back and below the 
same, between the named processus and the arcus zygomaticus {x on figs. 
15, 16), together with the angle lying above and to the front (yon the same 
figures), formed by the 2)roc£ss us maxiUaris and intermaxillaris of the os 
nasale. 

In all the specimens which I have examined it has shown itself that 
the processus maxiUaris in 0. cygmis is much more inclined than in 0. 
hewiclii, in which it is more perpendicular, so that perpendicular lines 
through the upper points of the angles x and y in the figures, descending 
to a line parallel with the commissure, have a not inconsiderable dis- 
tance from each other in hewicJcii, whilst they come together, or almost 
so, in the Hooper; or, in other words, in the latter the point of the angle 
X extends so far forward that it comes almost under the point of the 
angle y, which is far from being the case in Bewick's Swan. The re- 
lation can be very clearly seeu in the sketches. 

I have thus always found the formation of the bill, in old as well as in 
young specimens; and I have but little doubt that this relation, which 
agrees with the greater height of the bill in hewicMi, will show itself to 
be au excellent, easily perceived, and constant mark, and that by this 
the difficulty of distinguishing the young birds of both species by the 
assistance of outward marks is satisfactorily settled. 

Besides, if one compare the two above-mentioned young birds, sepa- 
rately described (see pp. 206 and 207), which would have taken, the ensu- 
ing spring, the white i^lumage of the old birds, the color does not show 
any particular difference. Exactly the contrary to what Mr. Dresser 
(Birds of Eur., April, 1880) describes,! the young heicickii now before me 
is considerably lighter than my specimen of the Hooper. Besides, the 
former has on the back numerous blackish hairlike stripes, formed by 
the dark-colored shafts, whilst they in the other are not darker than 
the radii. Another young specimen of the Hooper, belonging to the 
Bergen Museum, and which I have described in Nyt Mag. for Naturv., 
XXV, p. 145, is similar to the one in my collection. 

*Naumann has already drawn attention to this feature. 

t Said to resemble the young of C. musicus, but is, of course, mi;ch smaller, and the 
coloration of the plumage is rather darker.

N'ote 1 to the Synonymy. — As it seems impossible to decide whether 
Bartram has met with the Trumpeter or the Whistling Swan, I have 
admitted it to the latter species with query. Probably it may belong 
to this, but on the probability alone I should not like to transfer to any 
species a name which another bird has borne during a long time. 

I^ote 2. — In order to justify the change of the uame givxn by Sharp- 
less, and the reinstatement of Ord's title, I quote below Dr. Elliott 
CouES's investigation iu this matter: — " By their size and the difference 
in the voice, the two American si)ecies are correctly discriminated by 
Lewis and Clarke ;t nnfortunarely, however, they blunder in the 
matter by saying that the large species (i. e., the one subsequently 
called Cygnus buccinator by Sir John Eichardson) is the same as that 
common on the Atlantic coast; whereas, it is their other species, here 
called by them the Trumpeter, that is found also in the Atlantic States. 
But this confusion must not be allowed to stand in the light of the main 
point of this case, which is that in 1815, Ord based his Anas columbi- 
anus exclusively upon the Whistling Swan of Lewis and Clarke, i. e., 
upon the smaller of the two species, subsequently named Cygnus ameri- 
canus by Sharpless. The blunder of the original authors does not 
extend to Ord, to whose name columbianus should be restored its right- 
ful priority." (Bull. U. S. Geol. and Geogr. Surv. Terr. 2d ser. No. 0, 
p. 444.)

AHDSON in Faun. Bor.-Amer. II. p. 465, as belonging to 0. columhianm, 
Piofessor SCHLEOEL (Mas. T. B. VI, Anseres, p. 82) refers it to hewicJdl 
under AThich name Eichaedson also described it. In the mean time 
after It has been slioTvn that this species does not at all occur in the 
^ew World, It appears to be certain that the American ornithologists are 
right. The description contains, besides, nothing that speaks in favor of 
ScHLEaEL's opinion. -Cere orange (that color entirely behind the 
Bostrils)" agrees fully as well to 0. cohmUanus. It is not so remarka- 
le that EiCHARDSON himself identifies it with Yarrell's hewicldL for 
this was first described the previous year, and that without special de- 
tails concerning the color of the bill. Besides, it would almost seem 
as If the specimen had not been preserved, and the description com- 
piled from memory, or from a short notice in his journal. When the sneci 
men was killed at Igloolik the 0. hewicJcil was'not yet described. It is 
therefore most probable that Richardson at the time overiooked the 
species, and then, when first informed of the description of Yarrell 
has remembered that he had killed a Swan on which the yellow colo; 
lid not extend to the nostrils. In confirmation of this, it may be stated 
that the dimensions given are not of the specimen described, but copied 
from YARRELL, and that it is not indicated where it was deposited, as 
IS the case with the other specimens collected by him.

white spot is to be found right under the eye. The hinder back, and 
upper part of the rump are quite white, the rest of the rump and the tail- 
coverts the same as the shoulders; one of the tail-coverts was quite white, 
and as its base was still in the sheath,* showing itself to be a feather of 
the coming white plumage. The remiges are white, with broad pure 
gray tips, this color reaching back as far as the siuuation ; on the first 
and second still longer. The tail feathers are darker ashy gray, the 
basal half of the shafts being white. Whole of the under surface light 
grayish with a slight tinge of yellowish. iTnder wing-coverts and 
axillaries pure white. The shafts of the upper surface are somewhat 
darker than the webs, but not very perceptibly so, and do not form any 
distinct dark strij)es. 

Another young specimen in flesh (for the examination of which I am 
indebted to the kindness of Professor S. F. Baird), killed 14th Decem- 
ber, 1881, measured from tip of the bill to the end of the tail 1,225""'. 
The bill had the same color as the foregoing specimen, but the light 
portion was somewhat more pinkish red. The plumage was also similar, 
with the exception that the whole underside behind the neck was white 
with faint rusty tinge on the border of each feather. 

In addition to the statements above about the color of the bill of the 
young bird, I give the following note, kindly given me by Mr. E. W. 
Nelson, showing the color of several freshly killed specimens, shot at St.

Michael's, Alaska, September 19,1870: "Bill purplish flesh-color,, ratlier 
light, and bordered along gape by black. Iris hazel." 

March 15, 1882, I had the opportunity of examining a living young 
specimen. The bill was black, except the portion between the nostrils, 
the posterior half of the upper tomium, and the whole margin of the 
lower mandible, which were of a vivid pinkish flesh color. The yellow 
spot in front of the eye was veiy perceptible, of common length, but 
still narrower and duller than in the quite adult bird. Iris hazel. The 
plumage white, except head and neck, which were gray, somewhat 
lighter than in the specimen described above.

Note to the Synonymy.— Trot W. Hincks laid before the Linnean 
Society, on January 21, 1864, the description of a supposed new spe- 
cies of Swan, Cyynus passmori, from Canada, which could be distin- 
guished from 0. buccinator EiCH., by several anatomical differences, 
also, amongst other things, by a smaller size (the whole length from the 
bill to the end of the tail being 1,295™"', in opposition to 1,524"^'", the 
distance between the tip of the bill and the hind border of the nostrils 
51inm^ in opposition to 76'"™) ; also, by faint dirty gray tinge in opposi- 
tion to buccinatorh generally more or less rust-colored tinge on the 
head and neck; by the same gray tinge on the inner web and points of 
the remiges, and by the naked black skin of the lores only reaching 
to the eyes and not surrounding them. There is, however, reason to 
suppose, and Mr. Hincks himself expresses strong doubts, that these 
differences only arise from age. The smaller size, gray tinge on head 
and wing-feathers, feathering of the skin surrounding the eye, are all 
features which prove the young age of the bird, and C. xmssmori may 
therefore be regarded as a young buccinator until the reverse has been 
demonstrated. 

Though the present species is a very distinct one, and the most remote 
of the genus to which it lielongs, it has been very difficult to point out 
a character wJiich will hold good hi birds of all ages. I am not at all 
acquainted with the quite young bird, but think, however, that the 
above diagnosis will be sufiQcient even for identification of the younger 
specimens. 

As both Olor cygnus and bewicMi are easily recognizable by the yellow 
color of the base of their bills, a nearer comparison only is needed with 
the 0. columbianus, of which specimens are said to be found which want 
entirely the yellow spot. I may here remark that I myself never met, 
amongst the numerous birds of this species which I have examined, a 
specimen on which I could not detect distinct traces of the spot by a 
careful inspection. 

Besides the larger size, which is not always sufficient to distinguish 
the two species, as a comparison of the Tables VII and VIII will show, 
it has often been stated as a good criterion that buccinator has twenty- 
four tail feathers in contradistinction to columbianus, which only has

twenty. Independent of the inconvenience of tliis character, when the 
birds moult their rectrices, I may confess that I only in a few cases 
have been able to count twenty-four tail feathers; and the inconstancy 
of the number of these feathers I have found pervading the whole group, 
this character changing individually, so that it is not at all to be de- 
pended upon. 

As a rule, the frontal apex of the ptilosis forms a sharp angle in 
huccinator, whilst it always is rounded in columhianiis ; but I have also 
seen specimens of the former which had the limit of the feathering 
rounded as in the latter. In huccinator I also usually fouua the dis- 
tance from the eye to the point of the mentioned frontal apex to be 
larger than from the same point to the hind border of the nasal fossa?, 
whilst the relation is quite the reverse in columhianus ; but I have also 
met specimens of both species in which this character was only very 
slightly expressed, the young columhianus especially having the culmen 
feathered longer forward than the older birds. 

The position of the nostrils, those being situated more backwards in 
the Trumpeter than in the Whistling Swan, is thus the only mark 
which it is possible to express in a short diagnosis, and which I have 
found constant and easily perceptible.

By M. CARBOIVRJIER. 

These amphibians live very well in an aquarium of suitable capacity^ 
30 to 40 liters of water for each pair. This water should be renewed 
about once a fortnight. Some clusters of aquatic plants {Elodca cana- 
densis) will assist in maintaining- the purity of the water, and their top- 
most branches will serve, at the same time, as a support for the eggs 
deposited by the female. These eggs resemble frogs' eggs; they are 
covered with a similar viscous material and are deposited in strings 
instead of being agglomerated ; they hatch in from 15 days to 3 weeks, 
depending upon the temperature of the water. 



* Translated from the French by Tarletou H. Bean. 



222 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

According to my observations, several days before tbe spawning tlie 
male spermatizes all the water in the aquarium and the zoosperms 
(spermatozoa) penetrate directly into the oviduct of the female, thus 
fecundating the eggs. The axolotl is capable of spawning five or six 
times a year, and produces each time from 150 to 200 young. A dim 
light is better for the maintaining of axolotls than a bright light, which 
they dislike. 

I have some individuals in which the branchine are altogether ab- 
sorbed; they have thus passed into the Amhlystoma state and respire 
entirely by the lungs {poumons), I have never been able to secure re- 
production under this last condition. 

I feed my axolotls with earth-worms; they are fond of tadpoles also; 
in the absence of these things I frequently give them calf liver, pre- 
senting it to them in small morsels by the aid of a piece of wood. 

The axolotl in its normal state is black ; the albino is a variety which 
I have obtained among the spawnings of the former, and which became 
permanent and fertile like the black form.

OBSERVATIOIVS ON FOUR ilIUI.ES IIV MII^K.- 

By Professor ALFRED ©UGES. 

[Trauslation of a note coutained in "El Eepertorio" of Guanajuato, Mex. No XVII 

187G.] ' 

Although observations relative to the milk given by animals which 
have not passed through the state of gestation are few, still a number 
have been recorded, including some regarding the human species. 
Fremy has given an analysis of the milk of a sheep and Schlossberger 
of that of a goat. Facts of this nature being so uncommon, I believe 
that the note which, conjointly with my learned friend Prof. Vicente 
Fernandez, I now publish, will prove of considerable interest. 

On the nth of May, 1870, having learned that there was a mule in 
milk at the Hacienda d'Argent de San Pedro de Eocha, on the Marfll 
road, a quarter league from Guanajuato, I went to the place, accom- 
panied by my friend Fernandez. Through the kindness of the em- 
ployes of Mr. Bernardo Lopez, proprietor of the f\irm, we were per- 
mitted to examine the phenomenal animal, which was then workin- in 
an ore mill. * 

The mule is of a chestnut color, with the nose, lower parts of the 
bmbs, belly, tail, and mane white. Its height is about 1^ meters: its 
proportions are perfect, without fullness of the abdomen; the breast is 
also larger than those of hybrids of the same kind ordinarilv; the back 
IS quite concave. Except in these particulars, however, there is not the 
least doubt but that we had before our eyes an ordinary mule. We 
were told that it had been bought five years before, and, according to the 
workmen, it was at least seven years old. On examination, however, I dis- 
covered that the teeth resembled those of a horse four and a half or five 
years old. It is possible that there is an anomaly here co-ordinate with 
the peculiar appearance presented by the mamm«. The latterare shaped 
like the alligator pear {Persca grattissima), black, and without nip- 
ples. Their length is 12 centimeters, exclusive of the base, which is

buried, as it were, in the skin of the abdomen ; as a whole the organs 
somewhat resemble testicles. According to the information given us, 
the animal had never given birth to offspring, nor had ever been 
served by an ass or horse. It appeared that two years before a work- 
man in the establishment, seeing that the mammae were a little large, 
attempted to milk the animal, and that the repetition of this act had 
brought about the condition in which we found the animal. In a 
moment, and before us, more than four hundred grams of milk were 
drawn, which issued with much force and fell foaming into the vessel 
prepared to receive it. When it had remained undisturbed for a little 
time it appeared of a dead white color, resembling that of milk of 
almonds. Its odor was slight, not at all resembling that of the mule. 
Its taste seemed to me oily and a little sweet, but as I tasted of it with 
repugnance I cannot describe the flavor accurately. Eegarding its 
other peculiarities I refer to the note of my friend. Professor Fernan- 
dez. The microscopic characters were those of ordinary milk. 

Such are the more important facts which I learned regarding the 
hybrid in question. The matter is known to a large number of the cit- 
izens of Guanajuato. 

The following note on the nature of the mule's milk is extracted 
from the report of Prof. Vincente Fernandez, which appeared in the 
same number of the " Eepertorio" in which my own observations were 
first printed : 

" The liquid obtained from the mule has the appearance of whey, is 
without sensible odor, and has a sweet taste. Its reaction is slightly 
alkaline. Density, 1.0270. Heat alone does not coagulate it. Acetic 
and hydrochloric acids coagulate it, however, and leave oil globules 
upon the filter. Sulphuric acid coagulates the milk also, and gives a 
white precipitate by forming an insoluble compound with the casein. 
It contains, therefore, two of the principal constituents of cow's milk — 
fats and casein. 

"By pouring into a test-tube 80 drops of pure sulphuric acid, 5 cen- 
tigrams of ox-besoar,* and a drop of milk, and heating to 60° or 80° 
F., I obtained a reddish purple color similar to that of a solution of 
permanganate of potash. This demonstrates the presence of glucose, 
which is formed by the sulphuric acid at the expense of the lactose — 
another principle of cow's milk. 

"In order to prove the existence of butter and of casein, I mixed 20 
centiliters of milk with an equal volume of a saturated solution of sul- 
phate of soda and one gram of carbonate of soda. 

"Filtration gave a clear liquid, and butter remained on the filter. The 
liquid, neutralized by acetic acid, gave a precipitate of casein, which the 
carbonate held in solution. 

*This reagent, very delicate for use iu recognizing the presence of glucose, is a dis- 
covery of Vicente Fernandez, and has always been of great service to me iu testing 
diabetic urine. — A. D.

"The result proves that the liquid in question is a true milk, and that 
this milk does not differ from that of horses in general, except by the 
presence of a little more fat, which diminishes its density. Possibly 
the predominance of fat is due to the fact that the milk remained a long 
time in the mammse, and that the casein underwent a regressive change. 
Otherwise it is a liquid almost entirely composed of olein." 

Subsequent to the time of this observation my friend, Mr. Epifanio 
Jimenez, brought to Guanajuato a mule five years old, which gave about 
a liter of milk daily for four months. The animal was taken away 
again, however, so that I was unable to examine it. 

I have been made aware of an additional fact. I received milk from 
two mules of the Hacienda de Luna, near Guanajuato, in February, 
1880. It is salt, very fat, and whiter than that of which an analysis 
has been given. The facts which I obtained are as follows : One mule 
is fifteen years old, the other eighteen. The first furnishes milk at all 
times of the year, and has done so from the time it was i^urchased. 
The second mule has been nnder observation only a month. Neither 
has given birth to young. The quantity of liquid given by the first 
animal is 250 grams per day; by the second, a liter or a liter and a 
quarter.

OIV I.AGOPUS MUTUS, I>EACH, AIVD IT.S Alil^IE!^. 

By I.UCIEIV M. TUR]\ER. * 

The following paper is based upon an examination of the specimens 
contained in the National Museum collection, to which I have been kindly 
allowed access by Professor Baird. A sufficiency of material alone can 
demonstrate to a certainty the relationship of birds subject to almost 
daily mutations of plumage as are exhibited in the various species of 
the genus Lagopus. 

It is well known that individual birds of this genus differ greatly, 
though they inhabit a restricted locality, such as a single mountain. 
The birds from the lowlands are larger and have a looser plumage, 
Proc. Nat. Mus. 82 15 July S9, 1 § 8®.

226 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

while those from the more elevated localities are perceptibly smaller 
and have a denser, closer litting plumage. 

During the wintex season the entire plumage is white with the excep- 
tion of the tail, and in some of the males of L. niutus, also the greater 
number of the females, a black stripe from the base of the side of the 
bill produced through the eye to the auricular legiou. This black 
stripe, however, varies in position and distribution. When nearly ob- 
solete it occupies the auricular region, and when greatly developed is 
continuous across the forehead of the bird, and is even present in the 
summer plumage of some females. This feature is specially charac- 
teristic of the winter plumage alone, however, and at this season it is 
almost impossible and even hazardous to assert that this or the other 
example is to a certainty this or that race. The table of measurements 
liroves only such variability of size as may be met with in individuals of 
any other series of birds belonging to the same species. 

The summer plumage is assumed at variable periods of the months of 
April, May, or even in early June, according to the locality. The moult 
for the summer is usually shown first on the head and neck, followed 
by the lower back, sides, breast, middle back, lianks, and abdomen, in 
the order named. The abdomen and chin are the last areas to show 
the complete moult. The parts named are also the first to assume, in 
the order given, the white winter plumage. 

During the time of the summerplumage scarcely a single day passes but 
that tlte general color of the feathers is not modified by the appearance 
or loss of some feather. How, then, is it possible to state just where 
the plumage of an individual shall constitute the summer stage when 
it is scarcely possible to find two birds of the same sex, age, and local- 
ity which do not differ in an appreciable degree of coloration, and 
where there are no other characters on which to base a comparison ? 
In the examples just compared I find the plumage of birds from Nor- 
way, France, Switzerland, and two localities in the "Barren Grounds" 
of Arctic America which do not vary in an essential color, and the pat- 
tern of coloration scarcely more divergent than will be found in birds 
of the same sex from the same locality of either region mentioned. 

The birds from the western coast of Arctic America and the east- 
ernmost Aleutian Islands do not, so far as I can see, differ appreciably 
from the European specimens in point of plumage during the breeding 
season. The males perhaps show a slight variation in shade of the 
ground color, but not in an essential degree. Hence the American and 
the European bird should be separated only as races, if at all, although 
most authors who have separated the American bird have distinguished 
it as a species by a binomial appellation — Lagoims rupcstris (Clm.) Leach. 

It seems to me, however, that the European birds mutus and alpinus 
should constitute, as is held by many authors, but a single species 
having the name Lagopus mutus Leach, while the American bird may 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 227 

be recognized as a fairly definable race to be called Lagopus mutus 
rupestris (Gm.) Ridgw.* 

The most striking variation of coloration is to be found in the ex- 
amples from Greenland and Cumberland Gulf. If the summer plum- 
age is to be taken as the consideration which shall constitute a species 
or race in this genus, then the birds from Greenland and Cumberland 
Gulf should be recognized as a definable form, for which the name Lago- 
pus mutus rclnhanlti (Brehm) should be used, unless the Iceland bird 
should prove to be identical (and this I have had no opportunity of 
verifying), in which case the birds of all the localities named above 
should then receive the name Lagopus mutus islandorum Fabeb. 

The birds procured by me at Atkha Islands (Aleutian chain) present 
still greater variations of coloration, and appear to represent a well- 
marked local race, for which I propose the name Lagopus mutus 
atl'hensis. 

The following descriptions of summer specimens, together with the 
table of comparative measurements, will help to establish tbe relation- 
sliip of the four races recognized in this paper : 

1. Lagopus mutus (typims). 

No. 34120, Lapland (67° N.), <?, ad., July 3 7, 1855. 

Head and neck dusky, with light gray tips to many of the feathers, 
and others having an obscure yellowish-brown spotting near, but ante- 
rior, to the gray. The back, rump, tail-coverts, and scapulars very 
dusky, much vermiculated with grayish and fulvous, the rump having 
a tendency to zigzag, fine markings almost approaching bars on the 
lower portion. Jugulum and breast having few light yellowish-brown 
spots, especially on upper breast and sides of the neck. The sides and 
flanks are strongly but sparsely barred with dusky and light bufi". Tail 
entirely black. This example is identical in plumage with No. 33546, 
^, marked ''T. lagopus,^^ from Norway, summer; and with 43680, <?, 
marked ''X. rupestris,''^ from the Barren Grounds of Arctic America, late 
spring. 

No. 33547 <?, ad., labeled "i. alpinus,''^ Norway, July 0, 1802. 

Head black, feathers narrowly tipped with brownish-yellow; entire 
neck black, the feathers tipped with pure gray; upper back black with 
narrow bars of light fulvous; back and rump black with fine dots of 
gray and fulvous, which latter disappear on the lower rump and upper 
tail-coverts, where replaced with small gray dots, and each feather 
tipped w ith a narrow crescentic band of grayish white. Jugulum and 
sides black with fine dots of white and buff, inclined to spotting. The 
tendency to produce bars is in this example nearly obsolete. The tail 
with a rather broader tip of white than in other specimens. 

No. 34119, 2, ad., "i. alpinus,^^ Lapland, July, 1855, and No. 18897, 
$, ad., "X. mutus,''^ France, late spring.

228 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

These two females are only distingiiisliable, the one from the other, 
by a slight variation in the shade of the yellowish -brown. Ihe bird 
from France is a little lighter in color than the other; the tendency to 
produce distinct bars of black, alternating with yellowish-brown, is very 
well marked, while on the inferior surface there is a somewhat distinct 
tendency to broader gray tips to the feathers. These markings are so 
little different from the pattern of coloration of the other specimens that 
it is not easy to exactly define the points of discrepancy. 

No. 56825, 5, ad., "X. mutus,''^ Switzerland, summer. 

General color above similar to No. 44582, "i. rupestris,'' Barren 
Grounds of Arctic America. The yellowish-brown is lighter and the 
bars narrower. The black bars also narrower and somewhat broken 
into (lots or spots. The ends of most of the feathers of the upper parts, 
iugulum, breast, sides, and flauks, broadly tipped with white. The best 
expression to define the coloration of this example in contradistinction 
to No. 44582, is to state that it (the Switzerland bird) is paler. 

No. 33549, $, ad., "T. lagopus,^^ Norway, June 11. 

No. 856, 9, yng., '' T. larjoxms,^^ Norway (nearly two-thirds grown). 

These two birds are conspicuous for the finer, narrower bars of yel- 
lowish-brown and black. The back, rump, tail-coverts, shoulders, sides, 
and upper part of the flanks distinctly tipped with white on the greater 
number of the feathfers. The jugulum and upper breast less marked 
with the white tips of the feathers, but more distinctly barred with black 
and the yellowish-brown. 

2. Lagopus mutus rupestris (Gm.) Ridgw. 

No. 2855, Barren Grounds of Arctic America, c? , ad., summer. Crown 
blackish, with white tips to some of the feathers, others very narrowly 
lipped with faint yellowish-brown. Neck and sides of head with greater 
area of white on tips of feathers. Back, rump, and tail-coverts very 
dusky witli fine vermiculations of fulvous and gray, having but little 
tendency to barring. The upper breast, sides, and jugulum barred 
with black and very light fulvons, some of the feathers broadly tipped 
with gray. 

No. 43675, 9, ad., Fort Yukon, Alaska, June, 1864. 

Head, entire neck, sides, breast, flanks, and abdomen light yellowish- 
brown, distinctly barred with black. Back, rump, and u]>per tail coverts 
very distinctly barred with bright yellowish-brown, each feather of the 
upper parts broadly tipped with a crescentic margin of grayish. The 
tail merely tipped with whitish. 

No. 80100, 9, ad.. Gens de Large Mountains, Arctic America. This 
example ])resents a lighter yellowish-brown coloration, occupying a 
slightly greater area than No. 43675, and the black bars being more re- 
stricted in width are not less conspicuous and the tips of the feathers 
more grayish. No other essential diflerences can be distinguished. 

Catalogue No. 73488, Unalashka, May 18, 1877.

S ad. The ground color of back, scapulars, rump, and upper tail- 
c:)verts dark liver-browii, tlie uape aud crown light reddish brown barred 
with black, and on the back and other posterior parts very finely aud 
densely vermiculated with black, producing the dark liver-brown general 
aspect. The jugulum similar to the crown and nape, but mth the black 
bars broader and more distinct, but becoming finer and less distinct on 
the upper breast. The wing, including primaries, secondaries, and some 
of the tertiaries white, with few scattered feathers of same pattern of 
coloration as the upper back. The longer upper tail- coverts are some- 
what darker than the color of the back, owing to the finer vermiculation 
of the black and brown colors. Chin and lower sides of head white. 
The black stripe from base of side of bill is much spotted with white. 
The lower breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts white. Tail black, 
with very narrow tip of white, and decidedly rounded in outline. 

Catalogue No. 73489. Fnalashka, May 18, 1877. 
9, ad. Upper parts, including head, neck, and upper tail-coverts 
bright brown-ochre, the tips of each feather either brighter or else 
white, coarsely barred, having a tendency to spotting with black, which, 
on elevating the superincumbent feathers, is greater in area on each 
side of the shaft. The lower parts, including foreueck, breast, and sides, 
bright yellow-ochre with sparser, but more regular bars of black. The 
wings, including primaries and secondaries, white. The wing-coverts 
similar to the coloration of the hind neck. The flanks and sides broadly 
barred with black and light yellowish-ochre. The lower tail-coverts 
very distinctly barred with black and yellowish-ochre, the latter color 
finely dotted with black and narrowly tipped with white. Abdomen 
white. The claws black with light edges and tip. Tarsus and toes of 
both sexes covered with fine white downy feathers containing few 
bristles. 

No. 43682, $ , ad., Arctic coast, east of Fort Anderson, H. B. 7, July 
25, 1867. 

This exami)le is in full breeding plumage and scarcely differs in any 
regard from No. 43675 and No. 80100 from near the same region. 
3. Lagopus miitus reinhardti (Brelim) Turner. 

No. 20346, <?, ad., Sukkertoppen, in lat. 65° 22' N. and long. 53° 05' 
W. on the West coast of Greenland, July 24, 1860; marked L. reinhardti. 
Ground color grayish-fulvous, minutely dotted with black and fulvous- 
brown, nowhere producing bars, excei)t on jugulum, upper breast, and 
sides of neck, where these bars are very narrow, and of black and yel- 
lowish-brown color. 

No. 20347, <? ad, (from the same locality as the preceding example) 
marked L. reinhardti. Is similar to the preceding, but has a more 
grayish ground color and greater tendency to barring on the rump, 
some of the tail-coverts, upper breast, sides of neck and jugulum. The 
tendency to produce bars is scarcely evident in No. 20346. 

No. 70997, 2, yng., Niantalik, Cumberland Gulf. 



230 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Xo. 7,0998, 9, ad., Niantalik, Cumberland Gulf, August 10, 1870. 

sso. 20345, 9 , ad., Sukkertoppeu, West coast of Greenland. 

All of these birds are labeled L. rupestris, but are so entirely different 
in plumage that they should be referred to L. reinhardti Brehm, or else 
to L. ulandorum Fabek, should these two prove to be the same bird, a 
statement which I am not preplired to make, as there are no accessible 
specimens of the Iceland bird with which to comi^are them. 

The birds from Niautalik and Sukkertoppeu present such great dis- 
tinctions from the corresponding plumage of riqwstris, that they should 
be recognized as distinct from nipestris. The pattern of coloration in 
these three birds is not appreciably different in the adult birds from the 
two localities separated by an expanse of water, which would hardly 
admit them being considered as a rare bird in those respective localities. 

The crown, hind neck, back, rump, and upper tail-coverts black, each 
feather distinctly edged with white, many of the feathers obscurely 
marked with short bars of light fulvous-gray, most conspicuous on 
wing-coverts and sides of neck The entire lower parts black, with 
biifly bars distinctly alternating with the black bars, each feather tipped 
with gray. The under tail-coverts show the bars very plainly. The 
breeding i^lumage of this bird is very similar to the corresponding 
plumage of the female of Ganace canadensis. 

4. Lagopus mutus atkhensis Turnev. 

Catalogue No. 85597. <?. May, 29, 1879. Ground color of upper 
parts light olive-brown, altogether lighter than in the corresponding 
plumage of rupestris. The whole surface very finely and densely ver- 
miculated with black. The tips of many of the feathers lighter and 
more grayish, with very narrow crescentic terminal bar of whitish. The 
ground color of head and nape above is more yellowish than that of the 
back. The crown spotted with black. Ground color of foreneck, jugu- 
lum, and ujjper breast light fulvous or yellowish-brown, distinctly and 
somewhat regularly barred with black. The upper breast, sides, and 
flanks similar, but more finely and distinctly barred with dusky. The 
wings, lower breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts pure white. The 
inferior upper tail-coverts in this example are little lighter than the 
rump, simply the obliteration of the prevailing ground color of the back. 
Tail black and decidedly truncate (not rounded as in riipestris), and 
narrowly tipped with white. 

No. 85598. $ . Same locality, June 7, 1879. 

This example of few days later plumage presents no appreciable differ- 
ence from the one of May 29, 1879. The extent of the white on the up- 
per breast is little greater. The dusky shaft of the wing quills is quite 
conspicuous in both examples. The black patch from base of bill is con- 
tinuous around the eye, and embraces the auricular region. The tar- 
sus and toes are only moderately feathered, and have but few bristly 
terminating feathers. The claws are long and narrow, black at their in- 



PROCFEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 231 

sertioii, and white tipped and edged. The bill is pure black, as is also 
the iris. 

Cataloo-ne Xo. SoGOO. May 29, 1879, 9 adult. 

Ground color of head, neck, breast, sides, flanks, and upper tail-cov- 
erts light brown-ochre, paler and much less rusty than in corresponding 
plumage of rupestris. The upper parts irregularly barred with black. 
The most of the feathers tipped with a crescentric bar of white, the 
black bar immediately preceding which is much broader than the others. 
The fore part of the back is irregularly spotted with black. Crown 
spotted with black, the feathers tipped with yellowish-white. Jugulum 
and breast more sparsely but regularly barred with black. The sides 
and abdomen similarly, but more broadly, barred with black and light 
yellowish-brown. But few feathers of white occur on the breast and 
abdomen. The under tail-coverts are very distinctly barred with black 
and light yellowish-brown, the tips of the upper tail-coverts and tail 
have a narrow band of pure white. The wings white, the dusky shaft 
extending not quite to the tips. The tarsus and toes are but slightly 
feathered. The claws black, with white edge and tips. The bill and 
iris black. 

Example No. 85599 is similar. 

When I first obtanied these birds I was struck with the api^arent 
greater size and also the difterence in the shape of the bill and claws. 
These birds frequent the low lands, where, amongst tlie rank grasses 
and weeds, a nest, com])osed of gTasses and other plants, is loosely ar- 
ranged. The number of eggs reaches as high as seventeen, though I 
never found more than fifteen in a single nest. The eggs are much 
darker in color than those of L. alhus and but little inferior in size. I 
had a number of eggs of this bird, but they were broken in transitu. 

The following tables of measurements of specimens in the National 
Museum collection will serve to show the differences of size and propor- 
tions which, to a certain degree, distinguish the several races of this 
species;

OEXERA OF THE SCOr.OPC:i\l>REI.L.II>^. 

By J. A. RYDER. 

There are two forms of this group ; the first has the body very slender, 
tapering- anteriorly, with the eyes or stemmata placed on the upper sur- 
face of the narrow, elongate head; the second form has a broader, more 
robust body of nearly uniform width anteriorly and posteriorly, with the 
eyes or stemmata at the sides of the head and not visible from above, 
the head itself being nearly circular or subquadrate in outliue from 
above. The first is the type to which we may assign the old designa- 
tion of ScoJopendrella originally i)roposed for it by Gervais; the second, 
of which Newport's species becomes the type, may be distinguished 
generically from the first as pointed out above, under the name of 
SciitigereUa. Tlie latter form is also distinguished from the first by the 
much greater development of the basal appendages of the legs.

A lilST OF THE SPECIES OF FISHES KECOROED AS OCCURRINQ 
IIV THE OLTf.F OF MEXICO. 

By O. BROWN OOODE and TARI>ETO]V H. BEAN. 

For the convenience of collectors in the Gulf of Mexico we have pre- 
pared the following list of fishes recorded as occurring in its waters. 
Of the species marked by an asterisk there are specimens in the National 
Museum from this region. We have not inquired into the validity of 
the other species, but have given them under the names by which they 
are cited in tlie works of Giiuther, Cuvier & Valenciennes, Girard, and 
other authorities, preferring to leave their nomenclature unchanged until 
studies have been made upon specimens. 

Nearly 300 species are enumerated iu this list and several unciescribed

By DAWm S. JORDAN and CHAKLES H. GflL-BEKT. 

The greater part of the montli of March, 1882, was spent by Pro- 
fessor Jordan at Galveston and Pensacohi, in the collection and stndy 
of fishes, in the interest of the United States National Museum. Fifty- 
one species of marine fishes were observed at Galveston and about 110 
at Pensacola; making a total of 129. These are enumerated below. 
The "common names" here given are, in all cases, those in use among 
the Gulf fishermen. The letters P. or G. after the name of a species 
indicate that it was observed at Pensacola or Galveston, respectively. 
Tlie specimens obtained are mostly in the United States National 
Mnseum. 

Professor Jordan wishes to make especial acknowledgment of his 
indebtedness to Mr. Silas Stearns, of Pensacola, for enthusiastic and 
intelligent assistance. Mr. Stearns is a member of the firm of Warren 
& Co., wholesale fish-dealers at Pensacola, and the resources of this 
firm were in the most generous way placed at our disposal. The most 
valuable portions of the present collection were obtained from the ves- 
sels sent out for Bed Snappers, the captains of these vessels beiug 
directed by Mr. Stearns to save for the Museum all small fishes taken 
from the mouths or stomachs of these fishes. Several interesting species 
were also obtained by Mr. Stearns and Professor Jordau, with a fine- 
meshed seine in the shallow waters of the Lagana Grande at Pensacola. 

It will be observed that the shore-fishes, even as far westward as Gal- 
veston, are essentially the same as those found along the Carolina coast. 
The forms found in deeper water have a close relation with the West 
Indian fauna.

The synonomy of the American species of Isurus has been much con- 
fused, as appears from the above account of it. It is certain that two 
species of this type, viz, Lamna cornuhica and Isurus delcayi, occur on 
our Atlantic coast. We find no evidence of the existence of Isurus 
spaUanzani Eaf. in our waters, although Dr. Giinther has referred the 
descriptions both of Storer and Dekay to the latter species. VV^e recog- 
nize the American I. delcayi, provisionally, as a species distinct from 
I. glauca, which inhabits the coasts of Asia and Africa, as, in the speci-

.men examined by us, the pectoral is much hirger than in the descrip- 
tion and figure of the hitter, published by Miiller & Henle. 

A single individual of Isurus dekayi, a female ten feet in length, was 
fonnd on the beach of Santa Rosa Island, near Pensacola. It showed 
the following characters : 

Color dark sooty-gray above, white below, the color abruptly chang- 
ing on the tail. The whole of the caudal, the dorsal and upper edge of 
pectoral, dark. Anal and under side of pectoral white. 

Head 5 in total length with caudal, the upper lobe of caudal 5i in the 
same. Pectoral fin falcate, as long as head; front of dorsal inserted 
well behind axil of pectoral, at a distance equal to ^ the head or a little 
more than half the dorsal base, which is 2^ in head. Height of dorsal, 
If in head. Distance from posterior edge of base of dorsal to front of 
ventral, If in head. Dorsal and pectoral somewhat falcate. 

Second dorsal very small, in front of the slightly larger anal, and not 
twice as large as eye. Interspace between dorsals, 2f times base of 
first dorsal. 

Gill area deeper than long; its depth 2f in length of head. Snout 
sharp, conical. Eye large, 4f in snout, wliich measured from eye, is 3 
in head. Nostril half nearer eye than snout; eye slightly nearer tip of 
snout than angle of mouth. Labial fold very short. Caudal keel 
strong, a pit above and below it. 

Greatest depth of body, three-fourths length of head. Teeth about 
ffj none of them with basal cusps; those of the middle of each jaw 
mnch longer and narrower than the others, as in other species of the 
genus.

2. Carcharias,* m). incert. Sharp-nosed Shark, G. 

The jaws of an unknown species of shark were obtained at Galveston. 
The teeth in the upper jaw are narrowly triangular, little oblique, and 
slightly notched on the inner side. Median teeth smaller and narrower 
than those on the sides. Bases of the teeth coarsely serrate, especially 
on the inner edge; crown of the teeth finely serrate. Lower teeth very 
narrow, nearly erect, their edges very minutely serrulate, appearing 
entire, except under a lens. Teeth about |f. 

* The name Carcharias first appears in Rafinesqne's Caratteri di Alcnni auovi Generi, 
etc., 1810, 10. Only neiv species nre noticed iu this paper, and but one is nieiitioued. 
Ca7-charias taurus Raf., a species of Odontaspis Ag., which does not agree with the orig- 
inal diagnosis of Carcharias. In Rafinesqne's Indice d' Ittiologia Siciliana, IHlO, j). 44, 
a work which appeared almost simultaneously with the preceding, we find three species 
mentioned under the head of Carcharias, viz, lamia, glaacus, taurus. It seems evident 
from the context that the former species was intended by Rafiuesque as the type of the 
genus C rcharias. It is, however, not described .and not identifiable, although the 
species called later " Carcharias lamia" by Risso, was probably intended. In view of 
the fact that nearly all modern writers have adopted the name Carcharias toT the genus, 
to which glaucus and ^^ lamia" belong, it seems to us that Cuvier's restriction of the 
name Carcharias may be retained, in spite of the evident objection to it. If Carcharias 
be retained, C glaucus should be considered its type, being a species certainly iden- 
tified and agreeing with the original diagnosis of the genus, with Avhich C. taurus 
was associated by error, an error several times since repeated. The two papers of 
Rafiuesque may well be considered as parts of the same memoir, the "Caratteri'" con- 
taining an account of "new" siJccies, " the Indice" an enumeration of known species.

This is the commonest of the large sharks found on the coast of Texas 
in the summer. A young male specimen 32 inches long was obtained 
at Galveston, and the jaws of a verj^ large example, in the possession of 
Mr. E. Gabriel, of Galveston, were also examined. 

The following is a description of the specimen obtained: 

Color slaty, with a distinctly bluish tinge above, whiter below, the 
white extending higher posteriorly, and forming a faint lateral stripe. 
Caudal fin all blackish; second dorsal and anal tipped with dusky. 

Body comparatively short and stout. Head very short, broad, bluntly 
rounded anteriorly, and much depressed. Mouth very broad and short. 
Length of snout from mouth If in distance between angles of mouth. 
Breadth of mouth between angles twice length of mouth. Angle of 
mouth with a pit from which radiate two very short furrows. 

Inner edge of nostril with a very blunt lobe. Distance between nos- 
trils but a trifle less than length of snout from mouth. Length of 
nostril greater than eye and half its distance from eye. Eye slightly 
nearer nostril than angle of mouth. Kostril a little nearer eye than tip 
of snout. Distance from eye to snout 1| times in interorbital width, 
which is 1§ in length of head to first gill opening. Gill openings short, 
the height of one a little more than half length of gill area. Top of 
head with numerous mucous pores. 

First dorsal beginning close behind pectoral, at a distance from the 
posterior root of the latter equal to about U diameter of the eye; the 
fin moderate in size, its anterior lobe rather obtuse, the posterior little 
produced ; the free edge of the tin little concave. Anterior lobe extend- 
ing when depressed a little beyond posterior lobe; the fin a little 
higher than long, its base 2J times in the interspace between dorsals, 
and about equal to the distance from the posterior base of the first dor- 
sal and tlie vertical from the insertion of the ventrals. Length of pos- 
terior lobe two-fifths base of the fin. 

Second dorsal very small, its base 5 times in the interspace between 
dorsals, less than half base of first dorsal ; the fin scarcely as long as 
high ; its posterior lobe moderately produced. 

Caudal moderate, the lower lobe not falcate, 2^ times in the length 
of the upper lobe; the latter 3| in the total length, about equal to the 
distance from the snout to the base of the dorsal. 

Anal a little larger than second dorsal and placed a little further 
back; its lobes more falcate, its distance from base of caudal 1 J its 
base. 

Ventrals moderate, their lobes bluntish, the anterior margin scarcely 
more than half the length of the base. Pectorals rather small, their 
tips not falcate, reaching slightly past posterior part of dorsal ; their 
free margins a little concave, the anterior margin a little shorter than

liead, G times in total leiigtli of body. Width of pectoral a little less 
than tbau two-t birds its length; the posterior lobe coutaiiied 3% times 
in its anterior lobe. 

Claspers, in specimen described, not reaching nearly to edge of ven- 
tral. 

Teeth of upper jaw broadly triangular, nearly erect, uot notched on 
the outer margin, the edges distinctly and rather coarsely serrate. 
Lower teeth narrowly triangular, with broad base, the edges finely 
serrate. Teeth in the young scarcely narrower than in the adult. 

The specimen here described was uot preserved, it having spoiled 
before the arrival of alcohol. 

Among the described species of this geinis Carcliarinmplafyodon (Poey) 
(^=ohtusus Poey) seems to be most nearly related to the species ex- 
amined by us. The pectoral in C. platyodon is larger, the teeth some- 
what dift'ei-ent, and the second dorsal is said to be "assez grande," 
whereas in C. coeruleus the latter fin is very small. (J. fronto, lately de- 
scribed by us from Mazatlan, is also verj^ similar, but has a much larger 
second dorsal. 

Another species, similar, but with longer snout, has been described by 
Dekay under the name of Carcharias ca'riileus. This description has been 
referred by Professor Gill to the synonymy of the very diflerent si)ecies, 
Carcharias phcmheus {Nardo) = Carcharias milherti M. & H., and has 
been called ^'■Eulamia milberti''\ 

There is, however, no good evidence that C. milherti {plumhcus) has 
ever been taken in our waters. The only record is that of INIiiller & 
Henle, who mention " ein Exemplar in Paris, von New York durch JMil- 
bert". This specimen is apparently not the type of the original descrip- 
tion; it belonged to a collection in which there were several confusions 
of localities, and if really from New York it may have belonged to some 
si)ecies different from the type in the museum at Berlin — perhaps to 
C. obscurus or cceruleus. 

There are aj^parently seven species of Carcharias (in the broad sense in 
which the genus is understood by Midler & Henle, Giinther, etc.,) now 
known to inhabit the waters of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the 
United States. If others exist, their occurrence is yet to be verified. 

These are, 

1. C. glaucus (L.) Cuv. 

2. * C. ohscurus (Le S.) M. & H. {Platypodon.) 

*The first four of these species may be readilj' recognized by the following char- 
acters : 

a. First dorsal inserted nearer veutrals than pectorals. {Carcharias).

The Squalus punctatus Mitch. (Traus. Lit. and Phil. Soc. 1, 484), 
agrees well enough with the comraon ScoUodon terncnovcc, and was 
probably founded on that species. It has, however, been identified 
by Gill with Gareharias isodon M. & H., a species oi Aprionodon. This 
species is known only from a specimen collected by Milbert — the local- 
ity not stated; but as some other collections of Milbert were made 
at I^ew York, this type of C. isodon has been assumed to be from that 
locality. So far as we know, no American collector has ever obtained 
a specimen of the species, and Gareharias isodon, or Aprionodon puncta- 
tus, should be erased from our lists. 

It is not likely that, the tyi^e of ^^ ScoUodsn terraiiovtc'^ really came 
from Newfoundland. It is a southern species, and is very abundant 
along our South Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

form agrees in dentition, character of bony i)lates, etc., fully with the 
Arius fdis of the Atlantic coast. The barbels in specimens of equestris 
examined are, however, somewhat longer, the maxillary barbel extend-

ing to about the end of the first fourth of the base of the pectoral; the 
others leugthened in proportion. In fells the barbel dees not usually 
reach the gill opening. The pectoral in equestris extends slightly beyond 
last ray of dorsal. These peculiarities are not likely to be constant. 
There is i^robably no permanent difference on which to base a subspecies 
equestris.

10. Megalops atlanticus C. &. V. — Grande £caiUe; ^^ Grandacoij" ; Tarpun; Silver 
fi8h. G. 

This species is generally common along the Gulf coast, but only scales 
were obtained. It reaches a length of some 6 feet. Its habit of leaping 
out of water like the mullet causes it to be dreaded hj fishermen. It is 
said that several i)ersons have been killed or injured when in small boats 
by the "Grande Ecaille" leaping into the boat. 

It seems to us that the specific name atlanticus should be adopted as 
the name of this species, being the oldest name ever really conferred on 
it. The earlier names " eyprinoides^'' Bloch, " thrissoides^^ Bloch & Schn.. 
and '■'- (jiganteus'''' Shaw, were alike based on a figure and description of 
r>roussonet, as Clnpea cyprinoides. Broussonet had evidently a specimen 
of the Indian species, Meyalops cyprinoides (Brouss.) Bleeker, and for 
this species the name cyprinoides should be retained. Bloch took his 
name ^'■cyprinoides'''' and his description from Broussonet, but added a 
figure from Plumier, of the American species. The names " thrissoides^^ 
and ''■ giganteus'^ were given as substitutes for '■'■ eypr'inoides^^^ and were 
likewise based prinmriiy on Broussonet's description. The earliest name 
intended for our species is Megalops atlanticus C. & V. The reference 
to Clupea apalike Lac, given by Giinther, is fallacious. Lacepede 
describes Clupea cyprinoides, "la clupe apalike," after Broussonet, his 
synonymy, like that of all writers before Cuvier and Valenciennes, 
including references both to M. cyprinoides and 21. atlanticus.

In life this species is bluish above, silvery below ; a faint narrow dark 
stripe along the middle of each row of scales on the back. Caudal fin 
bright yellow, its j)osterior margin blackish ; dorsal and anal dull yel- 
lowish ; paired fins, pale ; opercle, yellowish ; a blackish blotch on its

This species is not uncommon about Pensacola, where numerous young 
specimens were obtained. It is known to the fishermen as " alewife " or 
"shad," and is used only for bait. The sijecimens seen were 8 to 9 
inches in length. They are somewhat more elongate than the young 
of the northern shad, and the number of gill-rakers is pretty constantly 
smaller (about 38 below the angle of the arch, instead of 45 to 50).

{Meletta ttuocril Cuv. &l Val. xx, 375.) 

ISTot rare on the Gulf coast. Known to the fishermen only as a marine 
species. One specimen obtained at Galveston and one at Pensacola. 

The following is a description of the Galveston specimen : 

Color in life deep bluish -green above, the color abruptly ceasing on 
level of ui)per edge of gill opening; sides white, with a strong tinge of 
golden, especially on head. Dorsal yellowish, more or less dusky at 
base and in front. Caudal soiled yellowish, dusky at tip. Yentrals 
and anal pale; pectorals pale, a dusky streak on the inner side, behind 
first ra3" ; tips of jaws blackish; mouth yellowish within ; tongue bluish ; 
lining of opercle mostly pale; peritoneum white. 

Body comparatively long and slender; head not very deep; lower 
jaw strongly projecting, its tip fitting into an emarginctiou of the upper 
jaw and entering the profile; tip of lower jaw with a few slender decidu- 
ous teeth. Premaxillaries with a narrow band of rather strong ijenna- 
neiit teeth ; those of the outer series strongest. Tongue with feeble 
teeth ; vomer toothless. Gill-rakers numerous, but not long, not so long 
as eye ; about 5^- in head (about 22 below angle). Eye not large, 4^ in 
head. Maxillary reaching past middle of pupil, a little less than half 
head. Cheeks longer than deep; their depth below eye 4 in head; 
lower limb of preopercle 2^ in upper. Longest ray of dorsal IJ in head. 
Ventrals small, nearer snout than base of caudal. Pectorals 1^ in head. 

Head 4 (5 m total); depth 3^ (42). D. 2, 17; A. 1, 18. Lat. 1. 48. 
Scutes IG 4- 13 (19 -j- 15 in the Pensacola siiecimeu, 20 + 15 in a specimen 
from White River, Indiana). 

The Pensacola specimen is remarkable for its extraordinary fatness, 
the body being very plump and full of oil. It is very greasy to the 
touch, even after having been for some time in alcohol. 

16. Clupea pseudohispanica (Poey) Gthr, P. (30320.) 

Four specimens of this species, each 6^ inches long, were obtained at 
Pensacola. Its resemblance to the European sardine {Clwpea jnlchardus 



248 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Walb.) is very great; hence its name of " Sardina de Espana," ainoug 
the Cabau fishermen. 

Head 4^ to 4 J in length; depth 5 to 5.^; D. IG, A. 10: hit. 1., about 45. 

Body slender, little compressed, the belly scarcely carinated, its scutes 
not prominent; mouth small, the maxillary not extending quite to front 
of pupil, its length 2| in head ; gill-rakers long, very slender and numerous, 
about two-thirds diameter eye, between 30 and 40 on arch below angle. 
Lower jaw with a few feeble teetb, visible with lens; tongue with some 
asperities; cheeks much longer than deep, the vertical depth below eye 
about two-thirds diameter of eye ; eye 3| in head. Opercle without 
distinct stria? ; interopercle with very few. Ca udal well forked ; the lower 
lobe a little the longer as long as head. Yentrals inserted nearly be- 
low middle of dorsal, a little nearer base of caudal than tip of snout ; pec- 
torals 1^ in head ; a conspicuous sheath of scales at base of pectorals. 

About 45 scales in a longitudinal series; the scales being thin and 
deciduous, their number cannot be exactly ascertained. 

Color bluish above, becoming golden and silvery below, with no dis- 
tinct markings anywhere. 

reritoneum pale; lining of oi^ercle somewhat dusky. Intestinal canal 
somewhat elongate, about li times length of body. 

This species is mostly readily distinguished from G. piJcJiardus by the 
absence of radiating striae on the opercles, these being very conspicuous 
in the sardine. 

DOROSOMATIDiE. 

17. Dorosoma cepedianum (Le S.) Gill.— Shad. G. (30913.) 

Generally abundant, especially along the coast of Texas. The speci- 
mens all differ somewhat from the usual form of this species, and appa- 
rently constitute a local variety or subspecies, xjerhaps worthy of a dis- 
tinctive name. Compared with i^pecimens from White Kiver, Indiana, 
the Galveston form has a slenderer body (depth 'S^ to 3 in length, in- 
stead of 2J to 2|), and larger head (4 in length, instead of 4^). The 
dorsal filament is in all specimens shorter th;!n the head. There seem 
to be no other permanent diftereuces. D. 12; A 1, 32. Scales 5G to 20. 
Scutes 18 + 12. 

This species is not used for food. It must spawn in or near the sea 
at Galveston, as individuals of all sizes are abundant in the baj

pressed and slightly serrated. Head short, compressed, blnntish. Snout 
extremely short, not longer than the ])upil of the very large eye. Eye 
about 3 in head. Mouth somewhat oblique ; mandible extendhig farther 
forward than eye. Maxillary extending beyond root of mandible about 
to margin of opercle. Both jaws well provided with teeth. Cheeks 
broadly triangular, almost equilateral, smaller than eye. Opercle 
short, little oblique. Gill-rakers rather long, about two-thirds diameter 
of eye. 

Insertion of dorsal about midway between base of caudal and middle 
of eye. Caudal deeply forked, the lower lobe slightly the longer, about 
as long as head. Anal long and high, its base 3| in body, considerably 
longer than head. Pectorals long, li in head, reaching about to the 
front of the small ventrals, which do not reach the vent and are about 
2^ times in head. 

Scales thin, caducous. 

Color in life translucent, very pale, with bluish reHections. Sides 
with a narrow and not shar[)ly defined but bright silvery shade, scarcely 
wider than the pupil, distinct for the whole length of the body. Snout 
yellowish ; top of head dusty ; the occiput nearly black ; sides of head 
lustrous silvery. Middle Hue of head blackish; a series of dark points 
along the base of the dorsal, becoming a well-defined dark streak be- 
hind the fin. Dark points along base of anal, these also becoming a 
dark stripe behind the fin. Caudal distinctly yellowish, with many 
dark points; its tip dusky; other fins pale; the dorsal slightly yel- 
lowish. 

This species is very common in the Bay of Galveston, where many 
specimens were obtained. The longest about 2.^- inches in length. One 
specimen was obtained at Pensaowla; another is in our collection from 
Wood's Holl, Mass., where it is the commonest species of Stolephorus. 
From most of the North American species of this genus, S. mitchiUi is 
distinguished by the length of the anal and by the less sharply-defined 
lateral stripe.

2G-13. 

Color: (?, olivaceous; from dorsal forward above pectoral to head 
deep lustrous steel-blue, the color very intense and conspicuous in life; 
rest of npper parts with rather greenish luster, becoming dull slaty 
blue; and on cheeks, opercles, sides anteriorly, and belly, deep salmon - 
color; lower lip and preopercle, violet. Dorsal blackish, the anterior

This species is very closely allied to F. heteroditus^ but differs con- 
stantly in the much lower fins ; the interorbital width is slightly less, 
and the fins show some slight differences in coloration. F. grandis was 
found very abundant in the Laguna Grande at Pensacola, and was also 
found at Galveston, Tex.

Exceedingly abundant in the marshes about Lake Poutchartrain. A 
few specimens were also obtained at Galveston. This species is most 
closely allied to Gambusia holbroolci (Agassiz) ; a comparison with spec- 
imens of the latter from Indian Eiver, Florida, show certain constant 
differences. Thus, in holhrooM the eye is larger, more than one third 
length of head, and is contained li in interorbital width ; and the head 
is larger, 3§ in body. These slight differences may disappear on the 
examination of an extended series, but with our present material no 
variation is apparent. In the synonomy of holbroolci must be i)laced

Very abundant at Peusacola, where numerous specimens were pro- 
cured from the Laguna Grande. It is also very common about the 
wharves, the gorgeous dorsal fin of the male being conspicuous in the 
shallow water. 

28. Mollienesia lineolata (Grd.) J. & G. G. ; N. O. (30891.) 
? Mollienesia pocdlioides (Girard). 

Four female specimens and one male, from Galveston, Tex. (the largest 
2' long), and two females from Lake Poutchartrain, are referred by us 
to this species. They show the following difierences from M. latijnnna : 

Eye small, the iris jet black ; diameter of orbit 3^ to 3^ times in head, 
and If to 2 times in interorbital width (the eye 2| in head, and If in 
iuterorbital width, in laUpimm of same size) ; dorsal fin smaller, its base 
3| in body iu females, 3 in males, the rays constantly 13 or 14 in num- 
ber (usually 13) ; origin of dorsal equidistant from tip of snout and ru

dimentarj' caudal rays in females 5 in males, distant from snout by 
length of base of fin ; ventrals inserted in advance of vertical, from 
origin of dorsal, or, in male, opposite origin of dorsal ; color the same 
as in latipinna, except that all the specimens show the 5 faint, dark, ver- 
tical half bars on tLe sides. 

This species can hardly be regarded as more than a representative 
form of 31. latipinna, and, on the examination of a sufficient number of 
specimens of the various localities, may be found to vary into the typi- 
cal form. The differences pointed out above are, however, constant in 
the specimens in our possession, and seem to warrant the retention of 
the name for the present. 

The male fish described by Girard as Limia poeciloides, is probably 
referable to this species. Limia matainorensis, on the contrary, seems to 
be a typical latipinna. 

29. Muraena ocellata (Ag.) Jen. P. 

One small specimen in good condition, together with the remains of 
several larger ones, were taken from the stomachs of Ived Snappers at 
Peusacola. Color light olive green, darker above, becoming light yel- 
lowish on the belly, the dark color forming reticulations around whitish 
spots of various sizes 5 most of them round, some oblong and some conflu- 
ent, the largest not quite as large as eye; spots becoming smaller to- 
ward head and largest toward the tip of the tail. Dorsal with dark 
marginal blotches ; anal black edged ; a small jet-black spot at augle of 
mouth; no black around gill-opening. 

Teeth uniserial, the larger ones distinctly serrated on the posterior 
margin, rather strong and turned backward, those in front little larger 
than the others. Vomer, in all specimens examined, without trace of 
teeth; gape in head; dorsal beginning a little in advance of gill-open- 
ing. Head 2.^ in trunk; head and trunk a little shorter than tail; eye 
3 in gape, half broader than gill-slit, equal to interorbital space.

30. Ophichthys mordax (Poey) J. & G. P. 

One specimen, nearly digested, from the stomach of a Eed Snapper, 
at Peusacola. The dentition agrees better with Poey's account of his 
" MacrodonopJds ynordax,^^ than with Giinther's description of Crotalopsis 
punctifer Kaup. Dr. Giinther considers the two identical. 

31. Ophichthys macrurus Poey. P. (30895.) 

A single specimen, in good condition 11 inches long, was presented to 
the National Museum by Dr. August Galny, of Galveston. 

Color light olive, the back closely punctulate but pale, the belly 
whitish ; fins all pale ; dorsal and pectoral without darker margin.

of pectoral, which is about equal to greatest depth of body ; teeth all 
distinctly biserial. Dorsal beginning a little in front of tip of pectoral. 
Fins all edged with black. 

Body not very slender. Head narrow and pointed, the upper jaw 
projecting beyond lower. Bye large, more than half length of snout, 
its position over the middle of the gape, its diameter more than the 
interorbital width ; gape 2| in length of head ; teeth biserial on jaws 
and vomer, subequal, short, slender, and sharp, all of them more or less 
directed backward; no large canines; some of the vomerine teeth 
larger than the others ; nasal tubes short and inconspicuous ; gill- 
openings small, their height about f eye. 

Tail almost exactly twice length rest of body. Head slightly more 
than half trunk, nearly 9 in total length. Distance from snout to front 
of dorsal 2J in distance from snout to vent. Dorsal beginning opposite 
anterior fourth of pectoral, rather low. Pectorals long and narrow, 
about 2f in head. Free tip of tail sharp. This species is allied to 
Ophichthys parilis (Ricli.), but seems to be well distinguished by the 
short tubes of the nostrils. 

32. Ophichthys chrysops Poey. P. 

f Ophisurus gomesii Castelnau, Auim. Am6r. Sud., Poiss. j). 84. 

Two specimens, one male and one female, the male about 20 inches 
long, in poor condition, were taken from the stomach of a Red Snapper 
at Pensacola. The male with the testes well developed ; the female 
with two mrge ovaries extending for the entire length of abdominal 
cavity. 

33. Myrophis lumbricus sp. no v. (G.) 30896. 

A single specimen, 9 inches in length, obtained at Galveston. 

Color light olivaceous, scarcely translucent in life, with a slight 
bluish luster towards the head. Everywhere, except on belly, finely and 
densely punctulate with black, besides which are small faint spots of 
greenish yellow. Eyes bright green. Underside of belly and head with 
steel-blue luster. 

Body subterete, worm-like, tai^eriug backward almost to a point, 
even the tail scarcely compressed^ Diameter of head much less than of 
body. Head extremely small, slender, and pointed, the narrow upper 
jaw projecting well beyond lower. Eye small, considerably nearer 
angle of mouth than tip of snout, its length about half snout. Gape 
short, about 4 in head. Teeth all strong, slender, sharp, directed back- 
ward, apparently in single series, some of the anterior in the upper jaw 
canine-like, a single series of teeth on the vomer rather stronger than 
the teeth in the jaws. 

Gill openings small, oblique, rather close together, subinferior, just 
below the minute rounded pectorals, which are narrower than the gill 
openings and not much larger than the eye. Opercular region long, 
with very conspicuous concentric strife.

Head 10| iu total length ; greatest depth of body 33. Length of 
head and trunk 2| in total. Dorsal very low, beginning at a point 
nearer gill opening- than vent, at a distance behind gill opening about 
equal to length of head. Lateral line distinct. 

This species is evidentlj' distinct from the Myrophis found at Panama, 
which Dr. Giinther calls Myrophis punctatus. This species has larger 
head, larger mouth, longer pectorals, and the body more compressed, 
etc. Myrophis microsUgmius Poey, from Cuba, is said to have the 
dorsal inserted farther back. Kaup's description of M. longicoUis (= M. 
punctatus), from Surinam, also indicates a species with a longer head; 
but too little is known of that species to afford a comparisou with M. 
lumbricus, M. microsUgmius, or the Panama sj)ecies, if that be really 
different from M. punctatus Liitken. 

Three other eels, two of them Ophichthys, and the other perhaps an 
OpMosoma, and all new to our coast, were obtained from stomachs of Eed 
Snappers at Pensacola, but in such bad condition that they cannot be 
identified.

its second ray scarcely shorter than third, not forked. Ventral fin in- 
serted slightly nearer root of caudal than tip of snout, its tip extending 
very slightly past front of anal, its length 14 in head. Dorsal much 
higher than long, its longest rays slightly longer than head, reaching 
caudal. Lower lobe of caudal slightly longer than head. 

This rare and beautiful species has not been hitherto recorded from 
our coast. 

The species of the restricted genus Exoccetus (exclusive of Halocyp- 
selus and Cypselurns) represented in the National Museum from our At- 
lantic coast, may be recognized in the following analysis: 
a. Ventrals moderate, shorter than head, reaching little past front of anal ; second ray

Many specimens, the longest about seven inches in length, were taken 
with the seine in sea-wrack and algie in Pensacola Bay, especially in the 
Laguna Grande. In oar paper on the Fishes of Beaufort Harbor (Proc. 
U. S. Nat. Mus. 1878, 308) we have recorded a ^^ Siphonostomafuscum^ 
from that locality. The specimens referred to under that name belong

ent species. 

40. Siphostoma afHue (Gthr.) J. & G. P. (30827.) 

(S'q>hostoma sp. Jordan, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1880, 22; Saint John's River.) 

Abundant in Pensacola Bay in the same localities as the preceding, 
from which it is readily distinguished by the much shorter snout and 
the peculiar coloration. 

Color in life: Females deep olive-green, varying to brown, blackish, 
or slightly reddish, according to the character of the surroundings ; 
females with a black keel on tbe belly, which is obsolete in the male. 
Dark color of the back forming about 15 dark cross-bars, very faint and 
much wider than the interspaces. Plates of anterior parts of body, 
each with two narrow vertical stripes of shining silvery, very conspicu- 
ous in life. Sides of head mottled, especially on lower half of opercle. 
Snout daik above, abruptly paler below. Dorsal dark, like the body, 
with narrow dark oblique paler streaks formed of small pale spots. Cau- 
dal and anal dusky. Males olivaceous, mottled with darker, the vertical 
silvery streaks absent. Dorsal rays 28 to 31. Eings 10 -f 32. 

Specimens of this species from Saint John's Eiver, Florida, are in our 
collection. 

41. Siphostoma zatropis sp. nov. P. (30865.) 

A single specimen, 5g inches long, obtained from the mouth of a Eed 
Snapper. 

Color brown, marbled with darker and with reddish. Back and sides 
with ten broad dark bands, the anterior portion of each band paler 
than the posterior; all the bands broader than the whitish interspaces. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 265 

Snout whitisli, with two narrow dark bauds; opercle and lower part of 
head with white vertical streaks. Behind the vent the dark bauds en- 
circle the body ; before the vent the belly is immaculate. Caudal tipped 
with black. Dorsal rays 20 ; rings 18+30. Dorsal much shorter than 
head, on 1 + 4 rings. Head 9 in length; snout short, 2f in head; tail 
longer than rest of body, 1^ in total length. 

Occiput crested; opercle with a cousi)icuous keel. This species is 
very different from any other thus far found in our waters, and is an 
interesting addition to our fauna. 

Our specimen is doubtless identical with Syngnafhus albirostris Giin- 
ther (viii, 170) from "Mexico." The original Coryfhroichthys albirostris 
of Kaup from Bahia and Mexico is uncertain, and must apparently have 
been some other lish. It is said to have D. 27; rings 12+29. Syngna- 
thuseluccns Poey is closely related, but apparently different. 

42. Hippocampus zosterae sp. iiov. P. (30852.) 

Two specimens, each less than two inches long; a male with distended 
egg-sac, and a fenuile were taken with seiue in the Laguua Grande. 
They were found in the sea- wrack (Zostera) in water about 3 feet deep. 

Snout very short, about 2| in head; supraorbital spines moderate, 
diverging, each with a smaller spine in front of it. Coronet stoutish, 
high, fully two-thirds as long as snout, ending in five small, bluutish 
spines, besides which are a few filaments, which are about as long as 
snout; some filaments on the back of the neck; temporal spines shaxp, 
pouiting nearly straight out. Spine on side of throat rather short. 
Spines on body small, subequal, sharp, straight. A spine at base of 
pectoral, and one below it. Length of head about equal to greatest 
depth of body. Dorsal fin covering most of two body rings and one 
caudal ring ; the tin rather high and very short, the number of rays but 
12. Bings 11 + 26 to 30. 

Color olive-green, the sides of the head mottled and with some paler 
spots, especially about the eye ; dorsal mottled with dusky, in the male 
with a broad conspicuous red margin, in life. 

The smaller number of dorsal rays seems to fully distinguish this 
species from all others found in the Atlantic. 

43. Hippocampus stylifer sp. nov. P. (30876.) 

One specimen (9) about three inches long, "spewed up" by a Bed 
Snapper at Pensacola. 

Snout not very short, but little shorter than rest of head, equal to dis- 
tance from middle of eye to gill-opening; a small tubercle on the median 
line at base of snout above ; supraocular and temporal spines long, 
simi)le; a long spine on the median line in front of coronet, its length 
s<;arcely less than diameter of eye; coronet stoutish, high, its five spines 
broadly spreading, slender; the three posterior spines shortest and less 
divergent; extent of coronet greater than its height; spines of head with 
dermal tentacles. 



266 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Each alternate plate on the neck, armed on each of the dorsal ridges, 
with a long slender spine, which is as long as the eye, and scarcely- 
tapering toward the tip; each provided with a filament about as long 
as the spine; upper lateral ridges of each plate similarly armed, the 
spines shorter; lower lateral and ventral ridge on two plates, likewise 
armed. Each fourth j^late on the tail similarly armed with a long, 
slender spine on its upper and lower ridges. A strong spine in front of 
pectoral, and one below it. About fifty well-developed spinous pro- 
cesses on the body, besides numerous smaller spinous points. Base 
of dorsal elevated, the fin covering about 4 body rings, its number of 
rays IG. Rings about 12 + 31. 

Color brownish, crossed at intervals by darker bars, which have a 
grayish center. These bars cross the plates which have the largest 
spines. Suout blackish, with two or three oblique whitish streaks, one 
of them forming a ring. 

Two other specimens of this species, taken in gulf-weed oft" the east 
coast of Florida, by Prof. J. H. Corastock, are in the museum of Cor- 
nell University. 

Another specimen of Hippocamims^ in bad condition, was' taken from 
the stomach of a Red Snapper. 

Snout rather longer than postorbital part of head; coronet and 
supraorbital spines high ; spines on body and tail large and sharp. Dor- 
salrays aitparentlj" 16. Whether this specimen belongs to H. stylifer 
or not, we are unable to say. 

MUGILID.^.

Miigil mexivaiins Steiudachner, Ichtbyol. Beitriige, iil, 58, 1875. 

Excessively abundant, particularly about Galveston, where they are 
found even in the gutters along the streets. Held in low esteem as 
a food-fish, and largely used for bait. 

We do not believe that the mullet of Southern California and the west 
coast of Mexico, Mufjil mexicaniis Steind. can be distinguished as a species 
from the Atlantic fish. Both Miiffil albula and M. hrasilioisis appear to 
be equally abundant on both coasts, and their range on both sides is 
similar, M. albula reaching to Cape Cod, and Monterey M. brasiliensis 
to Virginia and Lower California. 

ATHERINID^. 

45. Menidia peninsulae (Goode & Beau) J. & G. P. (30918.) 

Very abundant about Pensacola, in schools along the sandy beaches. 

Light green; edges of scales with dark dots; lips and top of head 
dusky; a dusky streak along base of anal; eye silvery; lateral streak 
narrow, tapering ))ehiud; bases of pectoral and caudal bright yellow ; 
fins otherwise nearly x)lain ; D. IV-I, 8 ; A. I, 16. Scales 40-9. Scales

thin and smooth, their ed^es entire, as iu 71/. notata, from which closely 
allied species it differs mainly iu the shorter anal. Vertical fins scale- 
less. Length 4 inches. 

46. Menidia vagrans (Goode & Bean) J. & G. G. (30893.) 

Very abundant about Galveston, in schools along the sandy beaches ; 
originally described from Pensacola, but not obtained there by us. 

Color in life, light greenish above, the lateral band broad, covering 
two half- rows of scales, becoming narrow posteriorly; sides and belly 
silvery. Tip of snout and of lower jaw yellow, soiled with blackish. 
Each scale of back with oue to three dark i^oiuts, these forming about 
5 cousi)icnous streaks as seen from above; caudal yellow, with dark 
punctulations, its margin dusky ; dorsal and pectorals somewhat dusky, 
lower fins white, the anal with dark i)oints at base. 

Head 4f in length (5i with caudal) ; depth 5^ (Gi). D. IV-I, 8; A. 
I, 15 to I, 17. Scales 43-6. 

First dorsal very small, its insertion over front of anal, midway be- 
tween base of caudal and posterior angle of opercle ; distance from its 
front to front of second dorsal f head. Pectorals slightly shorter than 
head. Vertical fins with large scales. 

Scales firm, adherent, their edges crenate or laciniate, feeling very 
rough to the touch. Scales of head large. Length 4 inches. 

This species appears to represent in the Gulf the allied Menidia hosci 
[Atherinia menidia L.) of the South Atlantic coasts. M. vagrans differs 
from the latter chiefly in the shorter anal (A. I, 20 to 1, 22 in M. bosci.). 

ECHENEIDID^. 

47. Echeneis naucrates L. P. 

One specimen 25 inches long and another 8 inches long were taken 
at Pensacola. The larger example shows the following characters : Color 
nearly uniform dusky, the black lateral band little marked, the tips of 
dorsal and caudal lobes little paler than the rest of the fin. D. XXII- 
34 ; A. 35. Caudal lunate, the lobes pointed. 

The small specimen has but 20 laminae ; the lobes of the dorsal and 
anal are yellowish white, as are the upper and lower rays of the caudal; 
the median (black) rays of the caudal being abruptly produced. 

TRICIIIUIIID^. 

48. Trichiurus lepturus L.— Sfl5re-/is/i ; Silver Eel. G. (30983.)

men differs from otliers of this species examined by us in having the 
body very slender, tlie depth 1| in length of head. The coloration is 
peculiar, the back and sides being reticulated with black in fine pat- 
tern, on an olivaceous ground, there being about 12 cross streaks of black 
between the occiput and the dorsal fin. In S. grex these streaks are 
not usually half so numerous. The lower part of the sides is i>laiu 
silvery. The air-bladder is developed, and the ovaries in this speiimeu, 
which was about a foot long, are full of eggs. 

Scomber grex Mitchill (Trans. Lit. & Phil. Soc. N. Y. 1815, 422) of 
the Atlantic and Scomber diego Ayres (Proc. Cal. Ac. Sci. 92, 1855) of 
the coast of Southern California are apparently identical. The Medi- 
terranean species. Scomber coUas Gmel. (= S.imcumatophorus Delaroche), 
seems to differ iu some i)articulars, slight, but constant in the speci- 
mens examined. These are shown in the following analysis: 

a. Air-bladder preseut. 

ft. Dark bands ou bock broad, as broad as interspaces, usually confluent below 
with a wavy dark, lateral streak ou the level of upper edge of i)ectoral; sides 
and belly below the streak immaculate; head '.i\ to ;^f in length; longest 
dorsal spine not more than half head Grex. 

ih. Dark dorsal bands narrow, more wavy, not so broad as interspaces; lateral 
streak obsolete or represented by a line of dots; lower part of sides with 
numerous irregular, wavy vertical streaks and reticulations of a dull gray 
color, which are usually broader than the interspaces; head 4 in length; 
longest dorsal spine a little more than half head Colias. 

50. Scomberomorus maculatus (Mitch.) J. & G. — Spanish mackerel. P. 
Abundant iu spring and summer -, one of the most important food- 
fishes. 

51. Scomberomorus caballa (C. & V.) J. & G. — King-fish. P. 

A specimen 4 feet in length was taken at Pensacola. Oolor in life 
steel-blue, jialer below, slightly clouded, but without spots ; upper fins 
dusky; lower fins whitish. Head 5 in length ; depth C. Maxillary 1| 
in head, reaching posterior margin of eye. Eye G in head ; snout pointed, 
2f in head. Teeth broad, triangular, smallest in front, those in lower 
jaw largest, their breadth at base ^ their height. Gill-rakers very short, 
scarcely higher than broad. Pectorals 1'^ in head ; ventrals 3|. Dor- 
sal lobe 3 ; anal lobe 23. Interspace between dorsals a little longer 
than eye. D. (spines injured) I, 14-9; A. Ill, 12-10.

specimen agreeing well with the detailed accounts of Cuvier & Valen- 
ciennes (ix, 11) and of Day (Fishes of Gt. Brit. 1881, 124, pi. xliv). 
There are at least three well-defined species or varieties of the type 
called Trachurus represented in our collections. These appear to cor- 
respond to the three species described, but not named, by Cuvier & 
Valenciennes (ix, p. 17), and all three are, if descriptions are to be 
trusted, found in the Mediterranean, and pretty widely distributed over 
the globe. 

Tlie following characters are shown by our specimens : 

a. Body comparatively deep and compressed, the depth 4 to 4 J- iu length ; scutes 34 

to 36 -j- 36 to 38 in number, the anterior scutes scarcely lower than the posterior, 

their height about f diameter of ej'e; length of curve of lateral line 1? to 1| in 

the straight part ; maxillary reaching past front of pupil 2J to 2^ iu head ; lining 

of opercle blackish Trachurus.* 

aa. Body moderately compressed, the depth 4^ to 4f in length ; scutes 38 to 404-38 to 
42 in number, the anterior little lower than the posterior, their height about three- 
fifths diameter of eye; curve of lateral line IJ to li in straight part ; maxillary 
reaching to front of pupil, 2| in head ; lining of opercle scarcely blackish.

These large exami^les were light brown above, silvery below, the 
jjectoral creamy with a diffuse black blotch below ; aual lobe and under 
side of tail deep yellow. Opercular spot jet black, sharply defined. 

Head 3f ; depth 3i; D. VI-I, 20; A. II-I, 16. 

A portion of the true synonymy of this species has been detached 
to form a mythical " Garangm chrysos,''^ by recent American authors. 
There is no doubt in our mind that the species called carangus Auct., 
esculentus Grd., and defensor Holbr. are identical with each other and 
with the original Scomber kqypos of Linnaeus. The original Scomber chry- 
sos of ]Mitchill was probably the young of the same species. 

Dr. Glinther has identified the Scomber Miipos of Linnteus with Caranx 
fallax C. & Y. This must be erroneous, as Caranx fallax is rare at 
Charleston, whence Linntieus received his specimens, while the present 
species is very common. The two chief distinctive characters given by 
Linnaeus "operculis postice macula nigra," and "dentium unica series, 
anterioribus duobus majoribus" apply, as Dr. Gill has shown, to the 
present specie.? and not to i\iQ fallax. 

55. Trachynotus carolinus (L.) Gill. — Pompano. P. 

Generally abundant in summer; the most valuable food-fish of the 
Gulf coast. It reaches the weight of 10 or 12 pounds. 

56. Trachynotus glaucus C. »fc V.— Gaff-top-sail Pompano. P. 

iSJ^ot rare; reaches a weight of two pounds; a food-fish of mediocre 
quality. 

57. Oligoplites occidentalis (L.) Gill.— Fp??ojr-/fli7. P. 



58. Seriola stearnsi Goode & Beau. — Amber-fish. P. 

Not uncommon on the " Snapper Banks" about Peusacola ; reaching 
a weight of about 10 pounds. One specimen was obtained and others 
were seen. 

This species much resembles the "yellow-tail" of the Cahfornian 
coast, Seriola dorsalis (Gill), which we have identified, with considerable 
doubt, with Seriola lalandi C. & V., a species originally described from 
Brazil. 

S. stearnsi is, however, readily distinguished from the " yellow-tail " 
by its larger mouth, the maxillary reaching to the middle of the eye, 
about 2^ in head (in S. dorsalis barely to front of pupil, 2| in head). 
Seriola stearnsi may be known from all the other Atlantic species, ex- 
cept S. zo7iata, by the greater number of rays in the soft dorsal. S. 
zonata has the occipital region carinated, while in ;8'. stearnsi., as in S. 
dorsalis, this region is broadly rounded. Seriola dubia Poey seems to 
resemble S. stearnsi, and may be identical with it. In any event the 
name '■'■duhia'''' could not be retained, as there is an earlier Seriola dubia 
Lowe. The description of Seriola gigas Poey does not indicate any 
character by which it may be separated from the true Seriola lalandi. 
The latter species has 2d D. I, 32 or 33 ; the Californian dorsalis I, 35. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 271 

The life coloration of Seriola stearnsi is light bluish above, whitish be- 
low ; a very distinct stripe of brassy -yellow from snout through eye toward 
the tail. Caudal dusky, not yellow. Second dorsal and anal dusky ; 
tip of dorsal pale. Pectoral dusky; ventral creamy, its inner edge 
somewhat dusky. Inside of mouth pale. D. V-I, 37 ; A. II-I, 21. 
Caudal keel unusually strong. 

59. Seriola lalandi C. & V. P. 

Seriola gigas Poey, Mem. Cuba. 
A specimen weighing about 25 pounds, referred by us to this species, 
was seen in the 'New Orleans market. It was taken at Pensacola. This 
species appears to reach a larger size than S. stearnsi, and to have fewer 
rays in the dorsal.

Seriola rivoliana Liitkeu, Spolia Atlantica, 1880, COS (considers rivoliana, hosci, 
faleofa,iind honariinsis as identical). 

Not uncommon on the Snapper Bank at Pensacola, reaching a weight 
of 10 to 12 iiounds. The synonymy of this species is badly confused on 
account of the imperfections in the earlier descriptions. If it be true, 
as supposed by Liitkeu, that all the Seriolw with falcate dorsal consti- 
tute a single pelagic species, this species will stand as S. rivoliana. The 
only eaily description which apjdies well to our specimens is that of 
Seriola falcata. It is possible that the species with the black temporal 
band (which, according to Mr. Stearns, occurs in Southern Florida) may 
be different from IS. falcata, in which case most or all the other synonyms 
referred to above might belong to it. 

The life-coloration of Seriola falcata is as follows : Grayish above, 
paler but hardly silvery below. Fins blackish, the pectorals pale, the 
caudal not at all yellow. Eye white ; lining of opercle pale; a very ob- 
scure olivaceous band from eye to front of dorsal, scarcely visible in fresh 
specimens. Preorbital and i^reopercle shaded with olive.

CENTROPOMID^. 

63. Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch.) C. & V. — Robalo. G. 

A food-fish of large size and delicate flesh, much valued along the 
Mexican coast. It is occasionally taken about Galveston in summer. It 
becomes more abundant southward along the Texas coast, and is one of 
the staple food-fishes about Brazos Santiago. An individual, weighing 15 
pounds, in the Galveston market, taken at Indianola, showed the fol- 
lowing characters : 

Dull pale olivaceous; lateral line black; caudal dull yellowish; lower 
fins pale. Maxillary 2§ in head, extending, to opposite posterior margin 
of pupil. Second dorsal spine reaching front of second dorsal, as long- 
as from snout to edge of preopercle. All the dorsal spines stroug. 
Second anal spine 2^ in head. Lat. 1. 70.

64. Epinephelus morio (C. & V.) Gill.— i?cfi <7?o«iJer. P. 

Common on the " Snapper Banks" about Pensacola, reaching a weight

species. 

Color brownish-olive, everywhere flushed with light red, the lower 
parts nearly salmon-color; whole body marked with obscure round pale 
spots, these obsolete on the fins, and most distinct in the young. Dorsal, 
anal, and caudal edged with blackish; pectorals plain red. Inside of 
mouth deep scarlet. 

65. Epinephelus drummond-hayi Goodc & Menn.— Spotted hind. P. 

Rather common on the banks about Pensacola, reaching a weight of

Color dark gray, each scale finely vermiculate with darker but with- 
out distinct spots; some specimens with the body everywhere marbled 
with darker in the form of large roundish blotches; old examples more 
uniform ; belly pale ; fins all grayish, their tips or edges blackish; pec- 
torals with no yellow or pale edging. Lips blackish, not tinged with

Snappers. The upper lobe of the caudal fin in this species is sometimes, 
produced in a long filament. 

69. Serranus trifurcus (L.) J. & G. P. 

Several young specimens, from 2 to 6 inches long, apparently belong- 
ing to this rare species, were taken from the mouths and stoniachs of 
Eed Snappers at Pensacola.

are rather broader than the interspaces. They are distinct only pos- 
teriorly and near the lateral line. No white band before the anal. A 
very small jet-black spot close behind eye in the young, becoming obso- 
lete with age; opercle with a dark diffuse blotch; chin and n])per ])arts

Dorsal fiu somewhat emarginate, the fourtli spine bigliest, about 2i 
ill IkmcI; this spiue and some of the others, occasionally filamentous; 
soft dorsal rather high, rather higher than fourth spiue, the longest 
rays more than half head. Caudal with the upper ray filamentous, 2^

them si)ecifically. 

70. Serranus subligarius (Cope) J. & G. P. (30859.) 
(Ceiitrojnislis sublif/aritis Cope, Proc. Am. Philos. Soc. Pbila. 187(t. 

Two young specimens, the largest 3 inches long", were obtained from 
the mouth of Red Snappers at Peusacola. Professor Co])e's type, the 
only specimen of this species hitherto known, was also obtained at 
Tensacola. 

Olivaceous, tinged with reddish above, paler below but not silvery; 
each scale on the sides with a blackish margin, these forming rather 
faint, continuous, dusky streaks. Posterior part of sides with faint 
traces of about 5 irregular cross-shades of darker along the sides. A 
large blotch of cream-color in front of the vent, extending upwards as 
an irregular cross-bar to near the middle of the side, its posterior edge 
sharply defined, its anterior fading into the color of the belly; a black 
ring around tail behind dorsal and anal ; a large, black blotch on front 
of soft dorsal, extending downward on the body, where it is less dis- 
tinct than on the fin. Cheeks yellowish ; opercles darker; lower parts 
of head brown, the preopercle (below), interopercle, lower jaw, and 
branchiostegals covered by a network of wavy bluish streaks. Spi- 
nous dorsal dark gray, mottled; soft dorsal similarly and more dis- 
tinctly marked. Pectorals, anal, and caudal grayish, with sharply de- 
fined narrow blackish bars, somewhat undulating. Yentrals faintly 
barred, mostly black.

71. Liitjainis blackfordi Goode & Beau. — Ilcd Snaj^prr ; I'anjo Colorailo. P. 

This tish is at present taken in far greater luimbers than any other 
on our Gulf coast. At Pensacola it is the most important food-tish, and 
in the X<^w Orleans market it is sold in greater quantities than all other 
species combined. It is taken with hook and line on the " Snapper 
Banks " usually from a to 30 miles oft" shore. It reaches a weight of about 
35 i^ounds, according to Mi\ Stearns, to whom we are indebted for most 
of the statements of weights contained in this paper. Ic is a rather 
coarse tish, but bears transportation well. 

This fish feeds on various small fishes — serranoids, eels, &c. — the spe- 
cies of which are thus far very little known. The systematic preserva- 
tion of small fishes " spewed up" by the Snappers when caught, or found 
in tlieir stomachs, has been begun by Mr. Stearns. We may in the fu- 
ture expect large results from this source, which has already yielded 
many of the most interesting forms contained in the present collection.

leather common about Pensacola, not reaching a large size. It is not 
often taken in nets, and its name " Lawyer" is said to be given in allu- 
sion to its skill in avoiding capture. 

In life, young specimens are dark green, paler below ; each scale above 
with a black spot which becomes gradually bronze down the sides ; 
these spots forming distinct stripes along the row\s of scales. Spinous 
dorsal with a blackish basal band, then a pearly baud, a broad black- 
ish band at tip. Soft dorsal yellowi.sh, spotted at base. Ventrals and 
anal dark purplish red, darkest and spotted at base. Pectoral trans- 
lucent yellowish. Caudal yellowish, tipped with reddish. A very dis- 
tinct bright-blue stripe across preorbital and suborbital. 

73. Liitjanus stearnsi Goode & Beau. — Mangrove Snapper. P. 

Not uncommon on the " Snapper Banks " at Pensacola ; one specimen 
obtained. 

Color (in spirits) dusky brownish above, the sides and below paler, 
more or less flushed with salmon red ; sides and lower parts of head 
flushed with red, especially behind jaws. Bases of scales on sides of 
breast and belly crimson ; centers of scales on sides whitish. Vertical 
fins dusky ; pectorals and ventrals largely rosy. 



216 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Scales above lateral line forming oblique series which are not through- 
out parallel with the lateral line. Teeth on vomer in an anchor-shaped 
patch, prolonged backward on the median line ; outer pair of canines of 
upper jaw very strong; inner small; canines of lower jaw not much de- 
veloped; maxillary reaching front of eye, 2^ in head; preopercle little 
notched ; band of scales on each side of occiput single, composed of 
about two series; 5 or 6 rows of scales on cheek; posterior nostrils 
ovate, pointed behind ; gill-rakers stoutish, not very long ; pectoral short, 
]X)inted, § length of head ; second and third anal spines subequal, short- 
ish, the soft rays rather low. Caudal lunate, the upper lobe slightly 
longest.

A single large specimen obtained at Pensacola. 

Body and fins dull gray; the middle of each scale paler; second dor- 
sal, caudal, and tips of ventrals of a dusky slate-color ; front of head 
with narrow stripes of steel-blue alternating with bronze, these stripes 
covering maxillary, preorbital, suborbital, whole naked part of snout 
above cheeks, and temporal region behind eye; the bands are faint or 
obsolete on opercle; a dark, vertical blotch on oi)ercle, near angle of 
preopercle, mostly hidden by the latter; mouth orange within, the 
color fading anteriorly.

Color light olivaceous, grayish-silvery below; a dark-bronze band, 
narrower than pupil, darkest in the younger specimen, from snout 
through eye straight to base of caudal; above this, two or three dark 
streaks, the middle one most distinct, from eye to above gill-opening ; 
another beginning on top of snout on each side, passing above eye, and 
extending parallel with the iirst-mentioned stripe straight to last ray 
of dorsal, where it meets its fellow of the opposite side; a dark streak 
from tip of snout along median line to front of dorsal ; a large, rounded 
black blotch at base of the caudal, some obscure dusky shading below 
soft dorsal and at baseof i)ectoral; fins all plain; upper shghtly dusky ; 
anal nearly white; pectorals, caudal, and ventrals light yellow; lining 
of opercle pale orange ; inside of mouth scarlet. In the large speci- 
men the dark stripes are fainter, paler, and more yellowish ; several 
tainter bands occur between the broader ones, and faint oblique streaks 
of light bronze follow tlie lovrs of scales, those above lateral line 
oblique.

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 277 

Body rather elongate, soiiiewliat compressed, the back a little ele- 
vated. Head uot deep, the snout short, but not blunt, 3 to 3;V in head; 
preorbital very narrow, little wider than pupil; maxillary reaching mid- 
dle of pupil, 2 in head ; eye large, 3i in head; scales of cheek small, in 
about 11 rows; gill-rakers short, not one-third as long as pupil; preop- 
ercle sharply serrate. 

Scales of moderate size, those above lateral line in very oblique rows, 
those below in horizontal rows. 

Dorsal spines rather high, the longest 1^ to 24 in head, longer than 
the second anal spine; caudal well forked, the up[)er lobe the longer, 
1^ to H in head ; second anal spine strong, longer and stronger than 
third, 2| to 24 in head, reaching, when depressed, to base of last ray; 
ventrals If to If in head; pectorals 1^ to 1^. 

Two specimens, in good condition, the largest oi inches loug, were 
taken from the mouth of a Eed Snapper at Pensacola. Our specimens 
agree in color with Hwmulon fremehundum , described by Goode & Bean, 
from Clearwater Harbor. The latter species is, however, quite different, 
being less elongate, with much smaller mouth and much larger scales, 
there being but 9 or 10 series between the lateral line and the vent.

Friatipoma fasciatum C. & V. v, "285; Giiutber, i, 301. 

A common shore fish of small size and good quality. It has little 
economic importance. 

Color in life light blue above, shading gradually into silvery below ; 
preorbital and snout of a clear sky-blue ; a dash of blue on side of 
upper lip; each scale on body with a blue centre, the edge with a bronze 
spot ; these forming on back and sides very distinct orange-brown stripes 
along the rows of scales; those above the lateral line extending ob- 
liquely upward and backward, those below nearly horizontal. Snout 
with bronze spots ; one or two bronze cross-lines connecting front of 
orbits ; two or three oblique lines on preorbital ; besides numerous bronze 
spots larger than those on the body; preorbital also with dusky shades, 
one of which extends on upper lip. Cheeks and opercles with distinct 
bronze spots, larger than those on the body. Inside of mouth pale ; in- 
side of gill cavity tinged with golden. 

Dorsal translucent, with about three bronze longitudinal shades, com- 
posed of spots, those on soft dorsal most distinctly spot-like; edge of 
the fin dusky. Caudal plain, yellowish at base, dusky toward the tip. 
Anal whitish, its edge dusky, its base shaded with bronze. Pectorals 
and ventrals yellowish, the latter darker at tip. 

Fresh specimens, so far as we have noticed, show no trace of vertical 
bands. On examples preserved in alcohol, the yellowish and blue 
markings gradually disappear, and dark cross shades become apparent. 
A specimen 5 years in alcohol shows the following coloration : Silver-

dusky baud from front of spinous dorsal through base of pectoral ; be- 
hind this 7 or 8 cloudy, obscure bands, alternately broad and narrow; 
a horizontal dusky shade behind eye; spinous dorsal with a faint me- 
dian pale shade, soft with three rows of faint spots; other fins nearly 
l>]ain. This specimen evidently corresponds to the Pristipoma fasci- 
(itinit of C. & Y. and Giinther, and as evidently' belongs to P. fidvom-

79. Stenotonius capriuus Beau MSS. — Goat's Head rovfiee. P. 

Two specimens, the larger partly digested, the smaller in good con- 
dition, were taken from stomachs of Eed Snappers at Pensacola. 

Color nearly uniform pale olive, silvery below ; sides with faint traces 
of dark cross-bauds; fins pale, the posterior margin of caudal blackish. 
Anterior teeth small, in a close-set band, the outer a little enlarged, com- 
pressed, and lanceolate. Two series of molars in eacli jaw. A Avell- 
developed antrorse spine before dorsal. Anterior profile irregular, 
abruptly depre'ssed above eye, the snout rather pointed. Scaly part of 
cheek as deep as long. Pectoral a little longer than head, reaching soft 
rays of anal ; dorsal spines slender, rather high, the first two short the 
third somewhat filamentous. Head 3^; depth 2. D. XI, 12; A. Ill, 12. 
Scales 7-47-14. 

This species is strongly marked. It is distinguished from S. argyrops 
by the deeper cheeks and preorbital region and the less elongate form, 
as well as by the structure of the si^inous dorsal.

Xot uncommon at Pensacola ; two si)ecimens obtained. 

Color golden-olive, the middle of each scale largely pinkish-red, giv- 
ing a general reddish hue to the fish ; sides and below silvery, flushed 
with red ; many scales of back and sides each with a small round spot of 
deep purplish-blue, these forming distinct longitudinal streaks on the 
sides below lateral line, the series somewhat irregular, running along 
the margins of the scales ; above the lateral line these spots are some- 
what scattered, forming very irregular oblique series, running upward 
and backward ; a few of these spots on nape and n^jper part of opercle ;

their edges translucent; spinous dorsal somewhat dusky; ventrals pale, 
with a i)inkish blotch at base; pectorals yellowish, especially at base, 
the axil somewhat dusky ; no autrorse spine before dorsal. 

Our specimens agree with various descriptions of European examples 
of this species, except in the coloration. In none of these descriptions 
is there any allusion to the blue spots which form so striking a feature 
of tlie coloration of the American fish.

The specimens from the Gulf coast differ from those taken farther 
north in the almost entire absence of the dark punctulations which are 
so conspicuous in the latter. They seem to be otherwise identical. 

Color in life silvery, slightly bluish above, the scales of the opercles 
and middle of sides with some dusky points. Spinous dorsal light yel- 
lowish, dusky at tip. Second dorsal and caudal uniform dull yellow. 
Anal bright yellow in front, the color fiiding behind. Yentrals slightly 
yellowisli, their axils orange. Pectorals yellowish above; axil silvery. 
Inside of mouth pure white ; an orange area puuctulate with black on 
inside of opercle. Upper fins all with some punctulations. Head 3^, 
depth 3jr. D. XI-I, 21; A. If, 9. Scales 7-52-11. 

87. Scaenaocellata (L.) Gtlir.—i?ef?;/is/i ; Po/ssoH ^o«i/e; Fez Colorado. P. G. (30845 
Peus.; 31914 Gal V.) 

The most important food-fish of tlie Texas coast, the amount taken 
exceeding that of all other s])ecies comljined. A good food-fish when 
not too large. It reaches a weight of 35 to 10 pounds, the large speci- 
mens being known as Bull Ked-fish. 

The serratures on tlie opercle, which are conspicuous in ordinary 
specimens, wholly disappear with age, the edge of the bone being 
finally entire and wholly covered by tlie skin. This change takes place 
gradually, being complete at a length of about 30 inches. 

Color of adults deep brassy yellow above, verging towards orange on 
the sides ; belly white ; head bronze, darker above ; a band of deeper 
bronze backward from eye. Young without bronze shades, all of which 
intensify with age ; scales in the young with darker shades forming 
undulating streaks ; these obliterated with age ; fins all pale, tinged with 
reddish, the pectoral most red ; second dorsal and caudal somewhat 
dusky. Mouth white within, lining of opercle black. Caudal ocella 
varying much in size, sometimes wanting ; sometimes two or three or 
even 8 to 10 or more in number. About 19 out of 20 individuals have 
the normal single ocella on each side. Iris yellowish. 

88. Liostomus xaiithurus Lac— C/(ojm Blanca; Spot; Flat Croaler ; Fost Croaker. 
P. G. (30S36.) 

Very abundant along the coast. A good pan-fish, but not very im- 
portant from its small size. The color is rather paler and more silvery 
than usual in northern specimens, the humeral spot and dark oblique 
lines less distinctly indicated. Dorsal and caudal light brownish, the 
tips darker ; soft dorsal yellowish tinge ; anal yellowish, somewhat 
dotted ; paired fins pale. 

D. X-I, 30; A. II, 12. Scales 9-48-13. Head 3^; depth 3. 

There is no evidence of the existence of two species of Liostomus. 
Liostomus ohliquus is the species when well preserved. Liostomus xan- 
thurus C. «& V. is a faded Museum specimen. Liostomus xanthuriis Lac. 
was so named from a confusion of the coloration of the species with that 
of the "yellow-tail," Scicena punctata.

The three species properly referable to this genus, after the removal

be taken as geographical varieties of one species. They may be thus 
compared :

One large specimen obtained at Pensacola, where it is said to be not 
uncommon. 

We have carefully compared this specimen with others from the coast 
of Massachusetts, and unable to detect any differences. 

This species has been hitherto supposed to be confined to the Xorth 
Atlantic coast, from Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras. 

This species is very close to M. alburnns, but differs constantly, so 
far as we have seen, in the smaller teeth, higher first dorsal and sharper

t The rude figure of Catesby (Albwnus americanus Catcsb. p. 12, t. 12) has usually 
been referred to this species. In the eleventh edition of the Systema Naturae, p. 321, 
this figure is the type of a "Cyjjriiius americunus.'' If this figure is considered identi- 
fiable (which it really is not), this species should be called Menticirruii americanus, the 
name of Perca alburnufi dating from the twelfth edition.

3104(i,3Ui4s. ) 

A common surf species, as abundant as the preceding, but less often 
brought to market. This species is very dift'erent from M. aJburmts, 
with which it has been confounded. Its relations are with the two 
Pacific coast species, 31. undulaUis Grd., and M. eJongatus Gthr., from 
the latter of which it is difficult to distinguish it. The following is a 
detailed description : 

Color in life gray above, with some bluish and with very strong bronze 
reflections; a darker bronze shade along sides on level of pectorals, 
extending to tail and along cheeks, the belly below this abruptly white. 
No trace of dark bars. Dorsals light brown; spinous dorsal black at 
tip, the base narrowly white. Caudal pale, its tips usually black; 
anal creamy, sometimes dusky at tip. Pectoral whitish, only its upper 
rays with dark punctulations, especially on the inner side, which is 
sometimes quite dark. Ventrals pale, puuctulate towards their tips, 
which are white. Lining of gill cavity pale. 

Head 3^- in length (3| in total); depth 4f (5J). D. X-I, 23 (not 27 as 
stated by Holbrook); A. I, 7. Scales G-50-11; 54 tubes in lateral line. 

Body elongate, the caudal peduncle very slender, its least depth 3f in 
head. Head long, rather broad ; the snout long, bluntish, 3 in head, pro- 
jecting moderately beyond the premaxillaries (for a distance of about one- 
fifth its length), which project beyond lower jaw. Mouth rather small, 
wholly inferior, the maxillary reaching little beyond front of eye, 3^ in 
head. Teeth in broad bands, the outer series in upper jaw a very little 
enlarged (very much smaller than in M. alburmis). 

Posterior nostril a lanceolate slit, as long as barbel, or about half 
diameter of eye. Eye small, 5 to in head, about one-fourth narrower 
than preorbital or interorbital space. Gill rakers about one-third diam- 
eter of pupil; about 7 on lower part of arch. 

Dorsal spines rather slender and high, the longest about two-thirds 
length of head. Soft dorsal moderate, its longest rays about equal to 
snout. Lower lobe of caudal broader than upper. If in head. Longest 
rays of anal a little longer than snout ; pectorals If in head, reaching 
slightly beyond tips of ventrals, which are about two in head. Ax- 
illary scale one-fourth length of pectoral; scales on breast very small; 
about 25 in a lougitiulinal series to front of ventrals, and about 15 in 
a cross series connecting outer margins of ventrals ; 10 scales in a 
vertical series from vent to lateral line ; 15 to 18 in an oblique series 
forward. No air bladder. Pyloric c«ca 9.

pounds. 

Color in life grayish, with very brilliant reflections of violet, green, 
etc., becoming silvery below ; sides of bead iridescent. Back above 
lateral line and behind middle of second dorsal covered with round 
black spots, somewhat irregular in size and position, most of them 
smaller than the pupil; a few below lateral line. First dorsal blackish 
at tip, with some dark spots. Second dorsal yellowish, edged with 
dusky and with 2 or 3 series of round dark spots. Caudal creamy, edged 
and broadly tii)ped with blackish, the base and median parts of the fin 
with small round dark spots. Anal and ventrals creamy, slightly soiled

Month small, oblique, the jaws equal, the maxillary extending little 
past front of eye, 3| in liead. Snout short, ^ in head. Eye large, 2^ 
in head. Preorbital entire; preopercle with distinct obtuse serratures 
or crenations. Teeth slender, conical, in a moderate band, those of the 
outer series considerably enlarged. Gill-rakers long, not as long as 
pupil. 

Dorsal somewhat emarginate, the longest spine li in head, the long- 
est soft ray about the same ; caudal lunate, the upper lobe slightly longer, 
about as long as head. Anal about as high as soft dorsal, its second 
spine If in head. Yentrals filamentous at tip, longer than head. Pec- 
torals about as long as head. Vertical fins largely covered with small 
scales. 

Color, when fresh, sooty gray, rather dark, a narrow blue stripe from 
tip of snout obliquely upward and backward across upper part of eye 
to above front of lateral line, where it ends in blue dots ; sides paler pos- 
teriorly and below; fins dusky, the distal half of anal, most of soft dor-

obtained. 

Head 3,^ (35) ; depth 4^ (5). D. IX-II ; A. Ill, 12. Scales 2-25-C. 

Body very slender, compressed, the snojit rather pointed, 3;V in head. 
Eye moderate, 5i in head. Posterior canine large. Dorsal si)iues low, 
rather slender, but i)ungeiit, lower than the soft rays. Caudal fin con-

Color, when fresh, olivaceous above ; a row of round sky-blue spots 
along each side of back ; a broad band-like area of orange intermingled 
with violet spots along sides from lateral line about to level of eye, 
extending backward about to middle of body ; the lower edge of the 
orange band serrate. Below the orange a baud of pale violet, becoming

deep yellow band about a>s wide a-s a scale, growing narrower and fainter 
behind. Belly pearly. Head above olivaceous, marked witb blue ; pre- 
orbital and suborbital region scarlet, with three violet;blue stripes, these 
margined with cherry red. Cheeks below lowest violet stripe translu- 
cent yellowish. Opercles bright red, with about 3 oblique violet stripes, 
the upper forming an oblique blotch behind eye, in the middle of which 
is a round black ink-like spot ; no dark opercular spot ; chin pearly. Iris 
red. 

Dorsal light orange, the soft part with three rows of violet spots ; caudal 
orange, with four rows of spots, the orange arranged in one longitudinal, 
two marginal, and two convergent orange bands, which are connected 
by reticulations around blue spots. Anal with a basal orange spot on 
each membrane, then a blue spot, then a broad yellow band, then a nar- 
row blue band, and a terminal band of orange. Ventrals light red. 
Pectorals pale violet, yellow at base ; a bluish oblique band below 
them. Blue spots of head and posterior parts clear, sky-blue ; elsewhere 
of a violet shade and less bright. 

This specimen agrees in many respects with Poey's ^'caudaU.s.'^ Poey, 
however, had a deeper fish (depth 4J in total length), and he makes no 
mention at all of the broad orange lateral shade so conspicuous in our 
specimens. It is possible that the latter difference is sexual. Poey's 
''pictus'''' has the orange band, but the body is too slender (depth oj in 
total), and the coloration is otherwise not quite like that of our speci- 
mens. 

97. Platyglossus florealis sp. uov. P. (30839.) 

Two specimens 3f inches in length were taken with a seine in the 
Laguna Grande, near Pensacola. They were found in shallow water in 
masses of Zoster a. 

Head ^ (3|) 5 depth 4 (4f). D. IX, 11; A. Ill, 12. Scales U-2G-8. 

Body rather slender, moderately compressed ; snout not very sharp, 
3J in head. Eye moderate, 5 in head. Posterior canines small. Dorsal 
spines rather low, stiff and pungent, lower than soft rays. Caudal 
truncate, If in head. Pectoral U in head. Scales on breast suuxll ; 
head naked. 

Coloration in life: ground color olive-brown; a rather dull olive-green 
stripe from above snout along sides of back to tail, midway between 
lateral line and dorsal ; a brownish area along lateral line ; below this 
a distinct dark brown band from gill-opening to middle of caudal on 
level of eye, and about as broad as eye, ending in a small dark spot 
at base of caudal. Below this another light l)rownish area bounded by 
a dark bronze stripe on level of pectoral, the belly abruptly pale. Each 
scale of side with a narrow crescent of deep greenish-blue towards its 
base. These spots are very distinct, especially anteriorly, giving the 
whole fish a bluish cast. Sides of head pale orange ; a bright blue wavy

98. Prionotus tribulus C. & V. G. (30910, 30201, 31053.) 
Common; numerous specimens obtained at Galveston. 
Coloration in life: light olive-green, the head and body everywhere 

reticulated with dark olive-green, in definite patterns, the dark lines on 
the head consi)icuous, arranged in a series of curves and concentric 
circles ; the dark streaks on the body mostly undulating and ascending 
backward. A diffuse band along side of bright orange. Belly white. 
Two faint diffuse dark bands downward and forward from soft dorsal, 
the hindmost ascending on the fin; a fainter band on spinous dorsal. 

Spinous dorsal reddish, clouded with darker. A large dark blotch, 
not ocellated, between fifth and sixth spines. Second dorsal translucent 
reddish, with darker spots. Anal similar, paler, the spots almost obso- 
lete. Caudal reddish, with three darker bands. Ventrals plain light

no spinous teeth on iireorbital ; pieopercular spine simple, long, and 
slender, without tooth at base. Spines on top and posterior part of 
head about as in P. jxdmijyes, but rather sharper, the furrow connecting 
orbits posteriorly not much marked. Opercular spine small. Eyes 
large, separated by a narrow concave space, the supraocular ridge 
prominent, serrate in front. Band,s of palatine teeth narrow. Gill- 
rakers long and slender, as in Prionofus punctafus. 

Dorsal high, its longest spine 14 in head. Pectoral scarcely more 
than J length of body, reaching to base of iifth or sixth dorsal ray. 

Coloration in life, dark olive above ; back and sides covered with 
numerous round spots of different sizes, and not arranged in series ; 
these si)ots bronze color in life, becoming brownish after death ; spinous 
dorsal dusky, with lighter streaks ; a distinct black spot on upper half of 
spinous dorsal, between the fourth and fifth spine, this spot being ocel- 
lated below and behind ; a second black blotch on upper half of first spine 
and membrane, also ocellated behind ; second dorsal and caudal spotted 
and finely blotched with black; anal largely black, with a pinkish 
border; pectorals blackish ; ventrals pale ; branchiostegals pinkish. 

This species, formerly erroneously identified by us with Prionotm 
punctatus, differs from the latter in its much slenderer form, in color, in 
the absence of spinous teeth on snout, and in the short pectorals. 

The original types were ol)taiued by us at Beaufort, Xorth Carolina, 
in 1S77. Another specimen (15148) is in the National Museum, collected

100. Astroscopus anoplus (C. & V.) Brev.—Dofj-Jish ; Electric Do{i-fish. P. G. 
(3U(r51, 30899.) 

This species is rather common about Galveston, and is not rare about 
Pensacola. Two young specimens were obtained at each place. The 
fishermen at Galveston ascribe to it electric powers in life — a trait already 
noticed by Dr. J. A. Ilenshall in the closely allied Astroscopus y-grwcum. 

Coloration of young specimens in life: dark olive above, becoming 
abruptly white beneath, the sides with a darker shade. Back and top 
of head, as far back as front of soft dorsal and as low as upper edge of 
pectoral, covered with small, round, light-green spots, none of them as 
large as pupil, those on top of head light brown. Posterior part of body 
speckled with blackish dots. First dorsal black except at base; second 
dorsal plain, with a dark blotch in front; anal and ventrals immaculate; 
caudal with three black longitudinal stripes, the interspaces pale. Pec- 
toral black at base, its edge pale. Lower jaw and median line of lower 
side of head yellow; a large oblong black blotch on each side of median 
line of lower part of head. Lips dusky. D. IV-I, 13; A. 13. Scales 
scarcely appreciable, visible only posteriorly. 

The naked area behind the eyes is much smaller in this species than 
in A. ygrcccnm, its .form being concavo-convex, its length barely twice

tliiit of the suout; tbe bony Y-shaped i)Uite on top of head is mnch 
vshoi'ter and broader in A. anojyhis, concave on the median line, and forked 
about half its length. The posterior, undivided p;ut of the Y is broader 
than long. The bony bridge across the occiput is but little shorter than 
the part of the head which precedes it. In A. y-gra:eum the Y is forked 
for less than half its length, the posterior part is more than twice as 
long as broad, and not concave on the median line; the naked area 
behind the eyes is trapezoidal, longer than broad, and about 4 times 
the length -of the snout. The bony bridge across the occiput is not half 
the length of the part of the head before it. 

The coloration of the A. y-gnccum is somewhat different. The pale 
spots on the body are larger ; some of them are as large as the pupil, 
and each surrounded by a narrow ring of black. They extend backward 
to the end of the soft dorsal, and also cover the lower jaw. The second 
dorsal is black (the base paler), with two oblique stripes of white; the 
anal is white with a broad black band ; the caudal black with two white 
bands, the corners also white; the pectoral brownish, with a broad black 
shade and a narrow edging of white; the two black blotches on the lower 
l)arts of the head are present as in A. anoplus, but less distinct.

aud inwards. In P. margaritatus* and P. j^orosissimus, the palatine 
teeth are not especially enlarged, subequal and more numerous ; the 
canines on the vomer being much larger thau any of the other teeth. 

Gill openings extending from upper edge of pectoral to just below 
lower edge. Pectoral without axillary foramen. 

Height of soft dorsal about 3 in head. Length of caudal nearly 2. 
Height of anal 3^. Length of pectorals 1| ; of ventrals 2|. 

Color in life light brown above, the top of head much darker and 
clouded with dark brown ; a row of about ten bar-like dark blotches along 
middle of side, each larger than eye ; those anteriorly deeper than long, 
the others longer than deep. Each of these blotches is usually more or 
less confluent with a saddle-like dark blotch across the back, A cres- 
cent-shaped pale translucent area below the eye ; below this a larger 
blue-black area, irregularly crescent-shaped, covering the preorbital 
aud suborbital region, bounded below and behind by a row of shining 
mucous pores. On it are about four large pores, and above and behind 
it, close behind and below eye, is a large shining pore bordered with 
black. Cheek steel-bluish. Sides of body silvery, becoming golden 
below. Lower part of head and belly bright golden. A dark stripe along- 
base of dorsal. Soft dorsal with 2 or 3 rows of small round dark olive

spots, the upper row posteriorly becoming a dark edging to the fin. 
Caudal dull red, edged with dusky. Anal very pale, edged with black- 
ish. Pectorals light orange, usually with some small dark spots above. 
Veutrals orauge, slightly darker anteriorly. 

Numerous series of i^ores on the body, those of the lateral Hue accom- 
panied by shining golden bodies, as in other species of the genus. Ac- 
cording to fishermen, these bodies are phosphorescent, shining at night ; 
a statement which is probably true, although we have been unable to 
verify it. Pores on sides of back not shining. jMost of the pores, as 
in other species, accompanied by numerous small cirri or cilia. 

The arrangement of the lines of pores and shining bodies is not very 
dift'erent from that found in P. margaritatus. It may be thus described 
in detail. 

A series of pores beginning at tip of snout, extending down around 
preorbital region, bounding the dark subocular blotch and joining almost 
at a right angle with a series of pores which extends downward from 
lower posterior corner of eye to angle of mouth. Another series diverges 
from the first in front of eye, passing close below eye, then upward above 
cheek, ending in a large pore behind preopercle. A curved series of pores 
extending backward along opercle, and another parallel with it aloijg 
subopercle. 

Two obscure series from front of eye along top of head, becoming 
wide apart at the vertex, converging at the nape, then slightly diverg- 
ing, converging in front of spinous dorsal, then again diverging to pass 
around the fin, each at last becoming straight at front of soft dorsal, 
extending close to its base to its last ray, there being about two pores 
to each ray. Just below this series, at front of soft dorsal on each 
side, begins a second series, with the pores wider apart and somewhat 
irregular, ceasing near the middle of the soft dorsal fin. 

The lateral line proper next begins above upper posterior angle of 
preopercle, whence a short branch passes directly upward. Opposite 
front of soft dorsal, the lateral line is interrupted for a distance a little 
more than diameter of eye. A short branch arises at this interruption 
and passes upward and backward at an angle from the end of the 
anterior part. Thence the lateral line passes straight to base of caudal. 

The next series arises just behind axil of pectoral, then curves 
abruptly downward and backward, becoming straight opposite third ray 
of anal, thence jn-oceeding to base of caudal, the pores small and close- 
set, anteriorly bead-like and shining, becoming dull toward the tail. 
]!sext comes a double series on each side of base of anal, the two series 
converging behind and finally coalescing. 

Another series begins at the middle of the base of the pectoral in front, 
curves downward, around the base of the fin, and, proceeding directly 
backward, ceases opposite vent. A series begins midway between gill 
opening and ventral and, extending straight backward, ceases opposite 
base of pectoral. Another begins, on each side, on lower side of head, 



PEOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 293 

directly below angle of inoutli, the two diveigiug- sliglitly between veu- 
trals, then converging a little behind ventrals, then abruptly diverging, 
joining the series last mentioned, on each side, jnst in front of l)ase of 
pectoral. 

A cross-series of pores e5:tends straight across belly, between vent 
and anal fin. At each end of this cross-series a series of i^ores turns 
abruptly forward, the two meeting in an acute angle on the belly just 
in front of a vertical from base of pectorals. Finally, three parallel 
series on each side of lower parts of head meet in front, the two ante- 
rior in obtuse curves, the posterior in an acute angle. The anterior 
series along the mandible ends at the corner of the mouth. The next 
just behind the mandible ends just below the corner of the mouth. The 
next passes along the branchiostegal region, ending at the gill oi)ening. 
JMandible with two large foramina. A series of dark-colored pores along 
each side of tongue. 

This species is not rare about Galveston, where many specimens, the 
largest 8 inches long, were obtained with the seine, iu water of moder- 
ate depth. It seems to be unknown to fishermen at Peusacola.

104. Gobiesox virgatulus sp. HOT. P. (30861.) 

Three specimens, the longest about 1;^ inches in length, taken among 
ballast rocks in Peusacola Bay. 

Head 2f (3f ); width of head 3^; depth G (7). D. 10 ; A. S. 

Body rather slender, the head low and rather l)road, broadly rounded 
anteriorly ; eyes very small, about 4 in head, their diameter two-thirds 
to three-fourths the broad, slightly convex interorbital space. Cheeks 
prominent ; opercle ending in a sharp spine. Cleft of mouth extending 
to below- front of orbit ; lower jaw somewhat shorter than upper. 

Teeth of upper jaw in a narrow baud of about two series; four teeth 
of the outer series a little larger than the rest, somewhat canine-like. 
Middle teeth of lower jaw incisor-like and partly horizontal, their edges 
entire or somewhat concave. Yeutral disk considerably shorter than 
head. Distance from root of caudal to front of dorsal 2| in length. 
Pectoral short, about 2f in head. 

Color in life olivaceous, with numerous paler spots; the whole body 
covered with rather faiut, wavy longitudinal stripes or lines of a light 
orange-brown color, about as wide as the interspaces, much as in some 
species of LipaHs; skin everywhere with dark punctulations. Caudal 
dusky, slightly barred with paler, its tip abruptly yellowish. Dorsal 
and anal dusky, somewhat barred. Body sometimes with traces of 
darker cross-shades. 

This species may be identical with Gohiesox mtdiis of Giinther, but the 
name nudus cannot fairly be reta ined, as the original Gyclopterus nudus 
L. was an East Indian species, very different from this.

Three specimens, the largest 3 inches long (Xo. 29G69, JJ. S. Nat. 
Mus.), taken from the stomach of a Ked Snapper, at Pensacola. 

OPHIDIID.E. 

115. Ophidium graellsi Poey. P. (308()S.) 

Very light olive, somewhat punctate above, slightly silvery below; 
fins without trace of dark edging (but being mutilated tbey may have 
been dark-edged in life). 

Head 4';f in length, depth about 7. Head small, the profile not very 
obtuse ; snout ig in head ; eye 3|, more than twice the narrow inter- 
orbital space ; mouth oblique, the maxillary reaching to posterior border 
of pupil, 2 in head ; lower jaw slightly included ; teeth small, in narrow 
bands in the jaws, the outer series in upper jaw somewhat enlarged ; 
vomerine and palatine teeth small, subequal ; head naked ; snout spine- 
less; opercle without spine; no evident pseudobranchine ; gill-rakers 
rather long and strong, 4 below angle of arch; occiput nearly midway 
between origin of dorsal and front of eye. Air-bladder long and slen- 
der, occupying nearly the whole length of abdominal cavity, tapering 
backward. 

Two specimens, one of which is in good condition and about 4 inches 
long, were taken from the stomach of a Eed Snapper, at Pensacola. The 
type of (jraellsi differed from the specimens before us in having a shorter 
head (more than 5 times in the length), and a larger maxillary (reach- 
ing posterior border of eye). But as the typical specimen of (jnu'lhi was 
8 inches long, the difference is prol)ably due to increased size. 

116. Genypteius omostigma sp. uov. P. (29G70.) 

Bo<ly comparatively short, highest at occiput ; thence tapering rapidly 
to tip of tail; upper profile of head very convex ; snout blunt; mouth 
horizontal, the lower jaw included ; maxillary not quite reaching i)osterior 
border of orbit; teeth in jaws uniform, strongly incurved, in rather 
broad bands ; a single series of small teeth in vomer ; those on palatines 
minute; maxillary 1§ in head; eye large, 3 in head, much larger than 
snout, equalling twice interorbital width ; opercle terminating in a strong, 
compressed spine, the length of which is about two thirds diameter of

pupil; gill-rakers very small, 4 below ou anterior arch. Loiiiiest ven- 
tral filament half length of head; the shorter three-quarters length of 
longer. Distance from origin of dorsal to tip of snout 3^ in total length ; 
distance from origin of anal to snout 2| in total length. Scales minute, 
imbedded. Pseudobranchia? not evident. Air-bladder short, thick, with 
a large posterior foramen. 

Head -if^ in length ; depth about G. 

Color light olive-green, silvery on belly, cheeks, and lower side of 
head; sides above with a few irregular, large, scattered, dark blotches; 
about 9 of these along base of dorsal fin ; an intensely black, round 
blotch on scapular region, rather larger than pupil; dorsal with black 
blotches; anal largely black; upper half of eye black, lower half bright 
silvery. 

A single specimen, 3i inches h)ng (Xo. 29070 LT. S. Nat. Mus.), taken 
from the stomach of a Red Snapper, at Pensacola. 

As here understood the genus Genijpterus diflers from Opliidliim in 
the presence of a spine on the opercle, a character api)arently of more 
importance than that drawn from the dentition of the palatines. In 
the latter respect 6^. omosHgma agrees more nearly with Ophidium. 

PLEURONECTID.E. 

117. Paralichthysdeiitatus(L.) J. & G.— jF/0H/(r7er. P.: G. (310:^8.) 

A common market-fish at Galveston, New Orleans, and Pensacola. 
Our specimens agree with others from VTashington market and other 
northern localities. 

The width of the iuterorbital space increases with age. In si)ecimeus 
10 inches long, it is wider than the eye, aud equal to the length of the 
snout, without the premaxillary. In young specimens it is proportion- 
ately much narrower. 

D. 88; A. 71. Gill-rakers narrowly triangular, 3 to 4 times as high as 
broad ; the mouth large, the maxillary reaching past eye, a little more 
than half head. 

The genus Pscudorhomhus Bleekeris in all respects identical with the 
prior ParaUchfhi/s Grd. Ancijlopsetta,, Ut'opsetfa, and Chcoiopfietta Gill, 
as well as Rippoglossbia Steindachner and Xystrenrys J. »& G. are 
inseparable from ParaUchtliys.

were collected at Pensacola. 

120. Hemirhombus paetiilus Beau MSS. P. 

Body elliptic-ovate, strongly compressed, not very deep; the anterior 
profile regularly decurved until just above the snout, where it forms an

with black, the pectoral of left side distinctly barred; blind side white., 
immaculate. 

Several specimens, only one of which was perfect, were taken froni 
stomachs of the Eed Snapper at Pensacola. The individual here- 
described is 7 inches long, some of the imperfect specimens being nearly 
a foot long. As usual in the genus Hemirhombns, the adults show longer 
pectoral, wider iuterorbital space, and the upper eye farther back. 

121. Etropuscrossotus J. & G. N. O. G. (30980.) 

One specimen found in the oSTew Orleans market, it having been takeu 
in Lake Pontchartraiu. Three others were obtained at Galveston. We 
have compared these carefully with the original types of the species 
from ]NLizatlan and with others from Panama, and are unable to detect 
any difference whatever. The wide range thus shown for this species 
is remarkable.

l)rownish ; these bauds rather irregular and about as broad as the eye ; 
between these bands irregular dark cloudings; the head spotted with 
blackish, fins with dark spots, the membranes largely black, the rays

A REVIEW OF THE SYiVCJNATHI^M: OF THE 1 >ITED STATE!!), MITH 
A I>E!!$C;RIPTIOi> OF O.XE XEIV SPEMES 

By JOSEPH SWAII^f. 

Tlie number of species of Pipe-fishes on our coasts has beeu uncer- 
tain, owing to the fact that the fishes have not been carefully studied in 
large collections from their various localities. The writer has endeavored 
to go over the group critically, to ascertain the number of species and to 
find the limit of variation in the characters of each species. ]N"early all 
the specimens studied by me have beeu collected by Professors D. S. 
Jordan and C. H. Gilbert; some of them belong to the United States 
National Museum, the others to the museum of Indiana University. 

The writer wishes to express his great obligations to Professor Jordan 
for the use of his collection and library, and for many valuable sugges- 
tions.

The length of the snout is of but little -^'alue for specific distinction. 
Professor Jordan found siecimens of S. californiense, at Santa Barbara 
and Monterey, with the snout no longer than the rest of the head. 

As is usual in this group the females differ from the males, in a more 
robust trunk, in a longer snout, and iu a greater keel on belly. These 
differences are not very constant. 

Habitat.— Facilac coa.st of the United States ; common south of San

6. Siphostcma bairdianum (Dnmeril) Svraiu. (:312;"3.) 

1 Siinfinatlius liairdlaniifi Dnmeril, Hist. Nat. Poiss. ii, 5/1, l~7n (coast of Mexico, 
uear California). 

Body uiuisnally stout, with short head, short snout, and short tail, the 
general appearance being much like S. caUforniense^ but all the parts 
contracted. Snout short, compressed, just as long as the rest of the 
head (9), its upper edge with a sharp, low keel, which is higher than 
in 8. californiense. Top of head wiihout keel. Opercle striate, with 
trace of a keel at base. 

Keels of body not very sharp, the interspaces between the angles 
scarcely concave. Lateral line not continuous with the upper edge of 
the tail. Belly with a slight median keel. Dorsal fin low. 

Eings 18+31. Dorsal rays 31, the tin inserted on 1 + 7 rings. Ten 
rings on the tail behind the caudal pouch. Head 7| in length -, base of 
dorsal equal to head. Distance from snout to dorsal 2^- in lengthy 
caudal pouch 2f in length of body; tail behind caudal pouch 6 times. 

Color blackish, with fine pale vermiculations; top of head and neck 
with wavy longitudinal streaks; caudal dusky; dorsal somewhat mot- 
tled; a dusky blotch before eye. 

A single male example, 9 inches long, was obtained by Mr. Andrea 
Larco at Santa Barbara, and is now in the National Museum. The 
caudal pouch in this specimen is full of eggs. 

This species seems most nearly allied to S. californiense, diftering iu 
the stouter form, much shorter tail and snout, and in the smaller num- 
ber of rings and of dorsal rays. 

It agrees fairly with M. Dumeril's account of Sijnfjnatlius bairdianits, 
the only discrepancy of importance being the statement that the dorsal 
covers 3+6 rings. The numbers^ of rings (17+31) and of dorsal rays 
(30), as given byM. Dumeril, agree very closely with the specimen from 
Santa Barbara.

PART IV.-ADDITIONS TO THE DEEP-WATER MOLUSCA, TAKEN OFF MARTHA'S 
VINEYARD, IN 1880 AND 1881. 



By A. E. VERRItl.. 

The following article contains the species of Mollusca that have been 
added to our deep-water fauna since the publication of my former article 
on the same sul>ject in these Proceedings (vol. iii, p. 350). This is 



316 PROCEEDIXGS OF UKITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

intended as a supplemeut to that article, aud 1 have, therefore, intro- 
duced here a number of the species previously recorded, of which the 
names have been changed, or which, on more careful study, have proved 
to be distinct from the European species with which they wei"e, at 
first, identified. The names of sucli species are printed in italic type to 
<listiugnish them from species now recorded for tlie first time, which are 
in black-faced type. I have not given any general summary, because 
it is expected that dredging will be again carried on in the same region 
by the United States Fish Commission during the present season.

Our shell has a somewhat higher and more acute spire than the one 
figured by Storer, and the callus does no>t reach its summit. There are 
four prominent folds on the columella, the two anterior ones very ob- 
lique. The color is not preserved. 

A single dead specimen was taken off' Martha's Vineyard, at station 
805, in 05 fathoms, 1880. Another specimen, also dead, but more per- 
fect, was taken, in 1881, at station 949, in 100 fathoms. Key West,

Buccinum Sanderson! VciTill. 

Trans. Conn. Acad., v. n. 400, pi. V8, fig. D (uucleus), Jnue, 18S2. 
Shell elongated, browuisb, trausluceut, rather thiu aud delicate, with 
a high spire: well impressed suture ; strongly convex, obliquely ribbed 
and strongly, spirally sculptured whorls ; a large, smooth, mammillary 
nucleus; a small aperture: aud a short, nearly straight columella. 

Whorls, in our largest example, seven, a little flattened below the 
suture, strongly convex in the middle; the penultimate whorl with about 
13 broadly convex, curved ribs or undulations, stronglj- excurved at the 
middle of the whorl ; on the body-whorl the ribs are less prominent and 
fade out below the middle : on the three upper whorls they are absent. 
The spiral sculpture, on the lower whorls, consists of prominent, narrow, 
rounded cinguli, unecpial in size and separated by narrow grooves; 
usnally there are three or four smaller and lower cinguli between two 
of the larger ones, and sometimes a narrow groove appears on the larger 
ridges, dividing them into two ; on the anterior part of the body-whorl 
the cinguli become more uniform in size and more numerous. The whole 
surface is covered with fine distinct lines of growth, which decussate the 
cinguli and mostly cross the ribs somewhat obliquely. 

The nucleus is rounded and remarkably large for the genus (2'"'" in 
diameter), translucent glossy brown, nearly smooth for about one turn 
and a half; the apex is regular aud not obliquely raised. 

The aperture is unusually small and short, elliptical, a little contracted 
posteriorly; outer lip thiu, well rounded, the edge receding in a broad 
curve below the suture; canal short and narrow; columella rather 
straight, thiu, with the folds slightly developed, the anterior end thiu, 
rounded, and projecting quite as far as the lip; the upper part of the 
columella-lip is not excavated, nor distinctly excurved. The operculum 
il5 small, pale yellow, rounded-elliptical, with the nucleus at about the 
middle of the length, aud a little to one side of the center. Epidermis 
thin aud smooth. Color of the shell, with epidermis, yellowish brown to 
dark reddish brown, sometimes with small whitish spots on the larger 
spiral ridges; columella whitish, inside of aperture pale orange-brown 
or light amber. 

Our largest example (female) is 40™'" long; breadth, 21"'"'; length of 
"body whorl, 29.5"^'"; length of aperture, 21.5""" ; its breadth (lip broken), 
12™'"; length of operculum, 11.5™"'; its breadth, 9™™. A male has very 
nearly the same propc»rtions. 

Off Martha's Vineyard, station 939, in 25S fathoms; station 1032, in 
208 fathoms, 1881, two living examples, male and female. 

This species resembles some of the varieties of B. nndatiim, but besides 
its more slender and elongated form and more delicate texture, it difl'ers 
decidedly in the character of the spiral sculi)ture, the shortness and 
small size of the aperture, and in the operculum ; but the most striking 
difl'erences are in the nucleus aud upper whorls, for the nucleus is more 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 319 

than twice as large as that of B. midatum, and different in cliaracter; 
wLile on the second and third whorls the spiral ciuguli are fewer and 
very much more prominent and coarser. The character of the nucleus 
and upper whorl will also distinguish it from all the other species of 
our coast. 

I have named this interesting shell in honor of Mr. Sanderson Smith, 
of the U. S. Fish Commission parties during these explorations.

Shell rather stout, fusiform, regularly tapered, obtuse at the tip of 
the spire, with the suture deep and canaliculate. Whorls about seven, 
broadly rounded and somewhat Hattened, narrowly but distinctly chan- 
neled at the suture. 

Sculpture over the whole surface, regular and numerous shallow, 
spiral grooves, or sulci, separated by slightly raised, flat, or somewhat 
rounded cinguli, usually but not constantly wider than the sulci; on the 
penultimate whorl there are about li to 1(3 of the sulci; slight but dis- 
tinct curved lines of growth cover the surface. Aperture narrow ovate- 
elliptical; outer lip broadly and regularly rounded, the edge receding 
in the middle in a broad, concave curve; at the base of the canal the 
lip is decidedly incurved. Canal moderately long, somewhat contracted, 
spirally curved to the left and strongly bent backw^ard at the tip. Col- 
umella very much bent, with a strong sigmoid curvature; portion o})- 
posite the middle of the aperture greatly receding. Epidermis thin, but 
firm, yellowish green to olive-green; when fresh and uninjured covered 
with fine, short, capillary processes, forming spiral lines along the cin- 
guli. 

Color of the shell white; inside of aperture translucent bluish white. 
The nucleus is moderately large (diameter 2.15'"™), smooth, mammil- 
lary; its first whorl is strongly turned up obliquely, and incurved. 

The median tooth of the radula is broad, with three denticles, the 
middle one largest; the lateral teeth are large, with three sharp curved 
denticles, the outer one much the largest, the middle one smallest; 
occasionally the inner one bears a small secondary denticle on its outer 
edge. 

Operculum long, ear-shaped, with the nucleus at the tip of the small 
end, which is but little incurved; inner edge strongly convex beyond 
the middle; outer edge broadly rounded. A female of the ordinary

This species was first dredged by us, in 1877, on the United States 
Fisli Commission steamer S])eedwell, off Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, in 
88 to 91 fathoms, fine compact sand, where it occurred in considerable 
numbers, living- : and off Halifax, 42 fathoms, dead. 

Off' Martha's Vineyard this species is very common in deep water. 
It occurred at 48 stations in that region in 18S0 and 1881 ; living speci- 
meus were taken in 8G to 410 fathoms, but it is most abundant between 
200 and 410 fathoms; at station 098, in 302 fathoms, 154 specimens 
were taken, 140 of them living. Dead shells, inhabited by Eupaf/uri, 
occurred in 64 to 85 fathoms, and also in 458 fathoms. It was taken by 
Lieut. Z. L. Tanner, on the Fish Hawk, in 1880, off Chesapeake Bay, 
in 56 to 300 fathoms; and oft' Delaware Bay, in 156 and 435 fathoms, in 
1881. 

This shell is closely allied to S. proplnquus (Alder) of Europe, to 
which I formerly referred it, with doubt. Our species is, however, a 
larger, more robust, and more hairy shell, and its nuclear whorls are 
totally different, for according to the descriptions, S. propinquns always 
has a regularly sjnral nucleus, with the first whorl minute and not turned 
up; this is, also, the case with an authentic specimen, in my possession, 
received from the Rev. A. M. Norman.

Shell long-fusiform, with a high, tapering, acute spire; with an im- 
pressed, oblique, undulated suture; with convex, transversely ribbed and 
spirally grooved whorls ; and with a narrow, rather long, nearly straight 
canal. 

Whorls .seven to eight, evenly rounded, crossed by about 13 slightly 
curved, regular, rounded and prominent ribs, separated by rather wider, 
regularly concave interspaces; the ribs are lower and a little excurved 
just below the suture, and fade out before reaching the base of the canal ; 
sometimes they are mostly obsolete on the body-whorl. The raised spiral 
cingnli are numerous, regular and close, crossing equally the ribs and 
interspaces; they are mostly alternately larger and smaller, and are .sep- 
arated by narrow impressed grooves ; the cinguli are crossed by very 
fine, close and delicate raised lines of growth, giving them a minutely 
wavy appearance. Aperture narrow-ellii)tical ; outer lip evenly convex,

incurved at the base of tlie canal, wliich is narrow and elongated, and 
but slightly bent to the left and a very little bent back at the tip ; 
columella slightly sigmoid. 

The nucleus is small, consisting of two whorls ; the first whorl is mi- 
nute and turned obliquely upward and inward, with a smooth glossy 
surface, crossed by a few small transverse grooves ; the next whorl is 
regular, smooth at first, then with fine spiral lines ; the normal sculpture 
begins on the third whorl. Color of shell, grayish white. No obvious 
epidermis. 

The largest specimen is 30™" long; breadth, 10,5™" ; length of body- 
whorl, 19™™ 5 its breadth, 9™™ ; length of ai>erture, 15"^™ ; its breadth, 4.5"'™. 

This species was dredged off Martha's Vineyard, by the United States 
Fish Commission steamer. Fish Hawk, in 1880 and 1881 (stations 891, 
938, 951, 1028, 1029, 1032), in 219 to 458 fathoms. 

This shell has a sculpture much like that of S. cidatus V., 1880, but it 
has a longer and more acute spire, a longer canal, narrower aperture, 
and a different nucleus. In general appearance it resembles 8. latericeus, 
but it is a more delicately sculptured shell, with a different nucleus. It 
also somewhat resembles 8. pellucidus (Hancock) in general appearance, 
but the latter has a much shorter and wider canal. 

According to the nature of the nucleus this shell would belong to the 
subgenus, 8iphonorMs Morch.

Shell small, thin, delicate, translucent, subfusiform, with a rather 
slender, acute spire; a short, straight canal; and few raised, revolving 
cinguli. 

Whorls six, convex, usually with three (rarely five or six) prominent 
rounded cinguli or carinre, separated by much wider, broadly concave 
interspaces; the uppermost one is usually some distance below the 
suture, which is imjjressed; on the last whorl there are about seven to 
nine principal carina, occasionally with a smaller one interpolated, and 
becoming more crowded anteriorly ; delicate and close, raised lines of 
growth cover the interspaces and cross the raised cinguli. 

The nucleus is very small, smooth and glossy ; the first turn is minute 
and regularly spiral, not upturned; three spiral cinguli appear on the 
second whorl. Aperture elliptical; outer lip thin, rounded, incurved 
at the base of the canal, which is narrow, but very short and straight ; 
columella nearly straight in the middle. The epidermis is thin, lamel- 
lose, but not ciliated. 

Color yellowish or grayish white. Operculum ovate, with the smaller 
or left end rounded and incurved, forming a small lobe, defined by a notch, 
and with the nucleus central to this small lobe.

The radula is very slender; the outlines of the median plates are in- 
distinct; they bear three very small, but distinct and nearly equal, den- 
ticles; the lateral teeth have only two denticles. 

Length, 11™™; breadth, 5™'"; length of body-whorl, 7.10"'™; length of

Off Martha's Vineyard, in 312 to 506 fathoms (stations 937, 917, 994, 
997, 1029), 1881, fourteen specimens. 

This delicate species is liable to be confounded with the young of S. 
pygina'us, but it differs decidedly in its dentition, operculum, nuclear 
Avhorls, short and straight canal, and in the character of its spiral cin- 
guli. The upper whorls of S. pyymtcus are much more angular, with 
coarser and more prominent carinse or cinguli, which are separated by 
narrower incised grooves.* 

This species, by its regular spiral nucleus, would be referable to the 
gToup Siphonorhis. It also approaches Molinia Friele, by the characters 
of its dentition and operculum.

Shell thin, delicate, translucent, white, nearly smooth, elongated, 
with a long, tapering, acute spire. Whorls eight, broadly and evenly 
rounded ; suture somewhat impressed, but not deep, frequently narrowly 
channelled. Surface, except anteriorly and on the canal, destitute of 
spiral lines, unless microscopic striations, and of any indication of ribs, 
but covered with very close, almost microscopic lines of growth, which 
give the surface a dull appearance, when dry; on the canal and extend- 
ing to the anterior part of the body-whorl are a number of distinct 
spiral lines, becoming faint opposite the middle of the aperture. The 
nucleus is larger than in A. romcea, rounded, depressed, and spiral, but 
somewhat mammillary. The aperture is small, oblong-ovate; the outer 
lip is sharp at the edge, but in adult shells has a. distinct thickening a 
little back from the margin ; the inner surface is usually smooth, but in a 
few adult examples it has a row of four or five small, transversely oblong 

* There are two varieties of «S'. ( Siphonorbis) pyijmwus on our coast, which are often 
■well-marked. The larger, typical form, from north of Cape Cod, has well-rounded 
■whorls, covered with strong cinguli and sulci, and with a strongly ciliated epidermis ; 
canal long and much curved. The other variety, which abounds off" Martha's Vine- 
yard, etc., in from 20 to 300 fathoms, on muddy bottoms, has the whorls flattened and 
much smoother, the cinguli often obsolete, in part, except on the upper whorls, and 
the epidermis dark green or olive, and only slightly ciliated, or often nearly or quite 
smooth ; and the canal is perhaps a little shorter and less curved. This may take the 
variety name, S. pygmcem, var. planulns. The nucleus and ajjical whorls agree well, 
however, in the two forms. The generic names, Neptunella and Siphonella, formerly 
used by me for this shell, are both preoccupied.

The true A. rosacea occurs in shallow water from oil' Cape Cod north- 
ward to Nova Scotia. It differs much from A. EUlholli, of Greenland, 
and if the latter is not a distinct species, it is, at least, a ver^- marked 
variety.

This shell, formerly supposed to be a white deep-water variety of A. 
zonalis {=A. dissimilis St.), proves to be distinct from the latter. 

. It is a stouter shell with a narrower, blunter spire, a larger nucleus, 
and a wider aperture. It has a more distinct caiml, which is a little 
curved at the tip. The surface is nearly smooth, except a few faint 
spiral lines on the canal. Shell pure white or pinkish, translucent, 
usually with the ai)ex distinctly pink or yellowish. It is very common 
off Martha's Vineyard, in 100 to 487 fathoms.*

A slender, transversely ribbed species, remarkable for the deep notch, 
widest within, and the deeply concave subsutural band. 

Whorls ten, somewhat angular and shouldered, crossed by strongly 
marked, somewhat oblique, angular ribs, which are most elevated at 
the shoulder, below the strongly marked, concave, subsutural band ; 
they do not extend on this band, and mostly fade out below, before 
reaching the suture ; ou the body-whorl the ribs are less distinct and 
sometimes absent; when present they extend only a little below the 
suture. The whole surface is covered with fine, wavy, spiral lines; 

* The true A. zonalis also occurred from near the shore to 120 fathoms. Those from 
the decider localities were highly colored and banded like the shore specimens.

fine, but rather conspicuous, lines of growtli cover tbe surface, and re- 
cede strongly on the subsutural band. 

Aperture small, ovate, rather narrow. Outer lip with a prominent, 
convex edge, which has a deep notch, situated a short distance below 
the suture. The notch is usually constricted or even nearly closed up 
at the edge of the lip, but is broadly rounded at its inner end ; this 
gives it a button hole like appearance. In some specimens it is but 
little constricted. Canal short, broad, slightly everted. 

Color, brown of various tints ; often brown, with one or two spiral 
bands of yellowish brown, and with streaks of light brown -, or the ribs 
may be pale yellowish brown ; aperture brown within ; columella whitish

This species is found from off' Martha's Vineyard to Labrador! It is 
not uncommon in Eastport harbor and the Bay of Fundy, where I 
dredged it in 1864, 18G5, 1868, 1870, in 15 to 80 fathoms. By the U. S.

1877 ; George's Bank, 45 fathoms, 1872 -, Gulf of Maine, at Cashe's Ledge,

Off Martha's Vineyard, 255 fathoms, 1881. It appears to occur on 
the coast of Greenland. 

Whether it can be identified accuratelj' with any European species is 
doubtful. Many writers have considered it identical with B. pyramid- 
alis (Strom). But the shell figured under that name by Prof. G. O. Sars 
appears to be quite different.

species in the cold waters of the Bay of Fundy, near Eastport, Me., and 
Grand Menan I., in 10 to 100 fathoms, where I have often dredged it, 
in 1861, 18G3, 1801, ISGo, 1808, 1870, 1872. We have also taken it, on

Bela pygmaea Verrill, Trans. Conn. Acad., v, p. 460, pi. 57, fig. 8, May, 1882. 

Shell very small, fusiform, or subovate, with four or five convex whorls, 
a very short spire, and a large body- whorl ; sculpture very finely can- 
cellated or reticulated. The whorls are usually rather evenly rounded, 
moderately convex, but often have a very slightly marked, rounded 
shoulder; suture somewhat impressed, rather oblique. The nucleus is 
relatively not small, with the apex not prominent, so that it appears to 
be obtuse, or rounded, smooth, glassy. The whole surface below the 
nucleus is covered by fine, raised, revolving cinguli, separated by slight 
grooves of about the same width, and by equally fine, slightly sinuous, 
transverse riblets, coincident with the lines of growth, and receding in 
a distinct curve on the subsutural band; the crossing of these two sets 
of lines produces a finely cancellated sculpture over the whole surface, 
but the transverse lines are usually more evident on the convexity of 
the whorls, while the spiral lines are more conspicuous anteriorly, and 
on the siphon. Aperture relatively large, oblong elliptical, slightly 
obtusely angled posteriorly ; sinus shallow, but distinct, evenly coucave; 
outer lip els^ewhere evenly convex. Canal short and broad, not con- 
stricted at base by any incurvature of the outer lip. Columella 
strongly concave or excavated, in the middle, sigmoid anteriorly. 
Color of shell, pale greenish white, covered by a thin epidermis of sim- 
ilar color. 

One of the largest sliells is 5.5'"™ long; 2.75^""' broad; length of body- 
whorl, 1"""; of aperture, 3'"'".

Only a few specimens have been taken off Martha's Vineyard, at sta- 
tions 892 and 894, in 487 and 3G5 fathoms, 1880; station 947, in 312 
fathoms, 1881. 

This little species bears some resemblance to B. decussata, bnt can be 
readily distinguished by the much finer and more uniform sculpture.

Bela iwcisuZa Verrill, Trans. Conn. Acad., v, p. 461, pi. 43, fig. 12; pi. 57, fig. 14. 

The shell is small, subfusiform to short ovate, with about five or six 
turreted, flattened whorls, which are angularly shouldered just below 
the suture. The subsutural band arises abruptly from the suture, 
nearly at right angles, and its surface is flat or slightly concave, 
marked by strongly recurved lines of growth, but mostly without spiral 
lines. The shoulder is often nearly right-angled. The whorls are 
decidedly flattened in the middle. There are, on the last whorl, about 
twenty rather broad, flattened or rounded ribs, which are nearly 
straight, a little prominent and usually slightly nodose at the shoulder, 
but they disappear a short distance below it. They are separated by 
well excavated, concave grooves, deepest close to the shoulder. 

The most characteristic feature of the sculi3ture is that the surface is 
marked by rather fine, but regular and distinct, sharply incised, narrow, 
revolving grooves, which are rather distant, with flat intervals. Of 
these there are usually about three to five on the penultimate whorl, 
and about twenty to twenty-eight on the last, the greater unmber being 
below the middle, on the siphon, where they become coarser and closer, 
with narrower rounded intervals. One of the sulci, just below the 
shoulder, is usually more distinct, and cuts the ribs so as to give their 
upper ends a subnodiilous appearance ; below this there is usually a 
rather wide zone, without grooves; usually no revolving Hues above 
the shoulder. The apex is usually eroded ; when perfect it is acute. 
The nucleus has a very small and slightly j)rominent, smooth apex; its 
first turn is marked with fine spiral lines; the next whorl has, at first, 
about three stronger, spiral, raised cinguli, which soon begin to be 
crossed by thin transverse riblets. 

Aperture about half the length of the shell, narrow ovate, or ellipti- 
cal, angulated above. Canal short, nearly straight, a little narrowed 
at the base by an incurvature of the lip. The outer lip has a decided 
angle at the shoulder, below which the edge is well rounded, and pro- 
jects strongly forward, in the middle; the sinus, above the shoulder, is 
rather deep, wide, and evenly rounded within. Columella strongly 
excavated in the middle, obliquely receding at the end. 

The shell is commonly greenish white and covered by a thin, close, 
greenish epidermis; but some specimens are clear white, rarely pinkish. 

Ordinary specimens are about e.S'"'" long; 3.5"^™ broad; apeiture,

This is one of the most common and generally distributed species of 
Bela found on the New England coast. It inhabits both muddy and 
sandy bottom, and sometimes is found among gravel and rocks. It 
occurs from the region ofl" Newport, R. I., northward to Labrador, and 
from very shallow water, in the Bay of Fundy and Casco Bay, to 500 
fathoms, off Martha's Vineyard. It is very common from Massachusetts

Bela concinnula Verrill, Trans. Couu. Acad., v, p. 4(J8, pi. A'^, fig. 15; pi. 57, 
fig. 11. 

Sheir rather small and delicate, long-ovate, regularly turreted, with 
about six whorls, which rise almost at right angles from the suture, and 
have an angular, or squarish, nodulous shoulder, usually distinctly car- 
inated by a thin, raised, spiral keel, which forms small, but prominent 
nodules where it crosses the ribs; below the shoulder the whorls are 
abruptly flattened. The subsutural band is usually little convex, or 
nearly flat. 

The ribs are numerous (often 20 to 25), regular, nearly straight below 
the shoulder, separated by concave intervals of equal or greater width; 
they extend entirely across the upper whorls ; above the shoulder they 
are slightly' excurved on the subsutural band. Whole surface covered 
with regular and rather strong, rounded, elevated, revolving cinguli, 
which cross the ribs and produce on them small, rounded nodes, and 
give a pretty regularly and strongly cancellated appearance to the 
whole surface. On the penultimate whorl there are four or five cinguli 
below the angle. Aperture rather short, narrow-ovate, angulated pos- 
teriorly; sinus broad and shallow. Canal narrow, a little produced, 
and slightly curved; columella decidedly sigmoid, its inner edge ex- 
curved at the end. 

Color of the shell white, or pale greenish white, covered with a thin, 
pale green epidermis. 

A rather large male is 11.5™™ long; breadth, 5.25™™; length of body- 
whorl, 7™™; its breadth, 5™™; length of aperture, 5™™; its breadth, 2™™. 
An ordinary specimen measures, in length, 10™™; breadth, 4.5"'™ ; length

This species is common and widely distributed on this coast. It 
ranges from the region south of Martha's Vineyard, in deep Avater, to 
Labrador. By the U. S. Fish Com. it was dredged, oft" Newport, R. J., 
and Martha's Vineyard, in 252 to 487 fathoms (stations 880, 892, 947,

Shell thin, fragile, translucent, broader than high, with a short, de- 
pressed spire, the apex small and a little prominent, the last whorl laige 
and ventricose, with spiral carinje, bearing divergent epidermal hars. 
Whorls five, very convex, rapidly enlarging; suture deep, sligltly

first whorl minute. Sculpture, several raised, angular, spiral caiin;e 
separated by unequal intevals, on which are finer spiral lines, and 
numerous evident, thin, raised flexuous lines of growth, which ffoss 
both the intervals and carina?, rendering the latter finely nodiious. 
On the last whorl there are about ten carina;, each of which usuill.y 
supports a spiral row of long epidermal hairs; the uppermost of these 
is just below the suture, and its epidermal processes are long aid ap- 
pressed against the preceding whorl; the next is separated by awider 
space, while those on the conyex part of the whorl are nearer together; 
the last defines the border of the umbilicus, which is deep, hit not

Fossarus elegans Venill and Smith. 

Verrill, Trans. Conn. Acad., v, p. 522, pi. 57, fig. 2S, June, 1882. 

Shell small, ovate, with a short, acute, turreted spire, and five angu- 
lated and sharply carinated whorls, elegantly latticed between the cari- 
naj. The whorls increase rapidly, the last being relatively large. On 
the last whorl there is a sharp angular carina at the shoulder, often with 
a smaller one just below it, a larger and more prominent one around the 
periphery, and three or four smaller ones on the anterior slope, besides 
a spiral fold around the umbilical region; on the larger specimens there 
are, sometimes, two or three strong, raised varices on the last whorl, and 
the edge of the lip is thickened. The intervals between the carinas are 
concave. On the preceding whorls the two larger carinne are visible, 
often with a small intermediate one. The nucleus is minute, regular, 
smooth, a little prominent. The rest of the shell is covered, between the 
carinoe, with numerous, close, thin, obli(pie, raised lamellje, or lines of 
growth; those on the subsutural band are flexuous. Aperture nearly 
round; lip continuous; outer lip thickened, and with denticles exter- 
nally, where the carinse terminate. Umbilicus spiral, very narrow, 
sometimes closed. Color white.

arc moderately elevated and evenly rounded, and, on the lower whorls, 
a little thickened, most so in the middle; their interstices are crossed by 
several distinct spiral ciuguli, which also render the ribs a little nodu-

Mr. Dall has recently informed me that he has received from Mr. Jef- 
freys a shell belonging to this genus, and perhaps identical with this 
si)ecies, judging from the shell only. Mr. Jeffreys identifies the shell 
referred to with Gadinia excentrica Tiberi.

Stilifer Stimpsonii Verrill, 1872. 

A living specimen of this species occurred at station 1028, in 410 ftith- 
oms, 1881. In 1880 it was taken in considerable numbers at stations 
814, 823, 824, in 13 to 27 fathoms, off Block Island. These were living 
on the upper surface of the common sea-urchin {Strongyloccntrotus Dro- 
hachiensls). New Jersey to Nova Scotia!

Verrill, Trans. Couu. Acad., v, p. .536, pi. 58, figs. 14, 14a. 

Shell small, white, lustrous, elongated, with a very slender, acute 
spire. Whorls eleven, not very oblique, broadly rounded, a little flat- 
tened at the periphery; suture strongly impressed ; surface very smooth 
and glossy, without any spiral lines, but with slight, rather indistinct 
and irregular longitudinal furrows, which are often absent. Apical 
whorl small, strongly upturned. 

Aperture small; outer lip flattened, projecting a little anteriorly 
(more or less broken in all my specimens). Columella nearly straight, 
with no trace of a fold. 

Length, 4.8"""; breadth, 1.2""i. 

Off" Martha's Vineyard, station 895, in 238 fathoms, 1880. 

This shell resembles T. nivea Stimpson, which also occurs in the same 
region, but the latter is a longer and larger shell, with a decidedly smaller 
and more prominent upturned nucleus, and is strongly and regularly 
longitudinally ribbed. 

Named in honor of Mr. J. H. Emerton, for several seasons zoological 
artist of the Fish Commission.

CHomsTiDiE Verrill. 

The peculiar structure of the animal of the following species, and of 
its radula, will not allow it to be placed in any established family. 
Therefore, I propose to make it the type of a new family, Choristidev. 

This family may be characterized by the heliciform shell, with the 
periostraca continuous betw^een the whorls; lip continuous; columella 
without a fold; operculum horny, paucispiral. Animal with frontal 
tentacles united by a fold, and with simple posterior tentacles. Jaws 
well developed ; pharynx large, retractile. 

Eadula with three rows of rachidian teeth, the central ones small; 
with broad, bilobed, inner lateral teeth; and two rows of small, hook- 
shaped outer lateral ones. Gill composed of numerous lamelhp, attached 
to the inner surface of the mantle on the left side and over the neck. 

The position of this family is doubtful. Its head, tentacles, pharynx, 
&c., resemble those of many TccUbranchs. Its dentition is, apjiareutly, 
unique.

Shell thin, fragile, short, heliciform, with a low spire, and a very large, 
ventricose body-whorl. Whorls, in our largest examples, four to five, 
very convex, evenly rounded; apical whorl small, spiral, oblique; suture 
Impressed; surface smooth (the epidermis is destroyed and the surface 
of the shell is eroded in all the living examples). The whorls are in con- 
tact and united, but the epidermis continues around the whorls between

or in the sutures. Aperture large, forming more than a half-circle; 
outer side well rounded, nearly straight on the columella-margin; lip 
continuous all around, raised up and with the edge slightly everted, in 
the umbilical region, so as to ])artially conceal the umbilicus, which is 
rather large and deep, nearly circular. Operculum s^iiral, thin, horny, 
round-ovate, with the nucleus excentric and with two to three rapidly 
increasing whorls. 

The animals of several alcoholic sjiecimens were examined. Head 
large, short, thick, rounded or truncate, with two short, Hat, obtuse 
anterior tentacles, wide apart, but connected together by a transverse 
fold; posterior tentacles short, thick, conical, smooth; no eyes visible. 
Pharynx short, thick, retractile; jaws crescent-shaped, strong, black. 
Verge situated just below the right posterior tentacle, small, papilli- 
form, swollen at base; below this and farther back, a larger and thicker 
l)apilla, with basal swelling ; on each side, between the mantle and foot, 
at about mid-length of the foot, a small mammiform i)apilla; two small, 
flat cirri behind and beneath the operculum. Foot broad, ovate, with 
two tentaculiform i)rocesses in front. 

The largest specimens are badly broken; some of them were about 
10""" in length; greatest diameter of operculum, 6'""'; its breadth, 4.5"'"'. 
A perfect, but small, specimen is G""" long; breadth, G"'"'; length of body- 
whorl, 5.2"'"'; length of aperture, 4"""; its breadth, 3.2""". 

Station 1031, oft" Martha's Vineyard, in 255 fathoms, 1S81. About a 
dozen specimens, all living, were taken from the interior of an old egg- 
case of a skate {Raia, sp.). Most of them were badly broken. 

I have comi^ared these specimens directly with original specimens of 
the fossil Choristes elcgans, found in the post-pliocene of Canada by Prin- 
cipal J. W. Dawson, who very kindly sent me specimens, both adult and 
young. 

Our specimens agree very closely with the smaller fossil ones in form 
and structure. The principal difference is in the much thinner and 
more fragile texture of the recent shells. This may be due to mere 
local conditions. Therefore, until more specimens of the recent shells 
are obtained, I prefer to consider it a thin and delicate A\ariety of the 
ancient type. 

Koonsia Yerrill.

Allied to Fleurohrancluvcij with which it agrees in the character of 
the head, tentacles, proboscis, and gill. It differs in having the back 
swollen and overhangiug, both on the sides and posteriorly, with a dis- 
tinct mantle-edge all around, and with a wide groove between it and the 
foot posteriorly, as well as laterally ; the foot is narrower and prolonged 
posteriorly, with a specialized glandular groove near the end, beneath, 
and a conical papilla above, near the tip. 

The external reproductive organs appear less complicated than in 
Pleurohrancluva.

The verge is armed witli small hooks, but the spicule, present in the 
latter genus, is not protruded in any of our specimens of Koonsia, if 
present. 

Koonsia obesa Verrill. 

Trans. Couii. Acad., v, p. 545, July, 1882. 

Body large, stout, broad, with a large swollen back, smooth and white 
in the preserved specimeus, and defined by the mantle-edge, which 
forms a rim along the lateral and posterior borders. Head large and 
broad, with two short, fiat, posteriorly grooved, anterior tentacles, one 
at each corner; the anterior mantle-border runs between them, and sup- 
ports a row of small papilla?. Posterior tentacles short, stout, flat- 
tened, ear-like, with the outer edges incurved, forming a large groove. 

Foot broad and rounded anteriorly, with small auricles ; long, tapered 
and acute posteriorly, extending some distance beyond the mantle; a 
conical papilla, near the tip, above; under side, near the end, with a 
narrow, elongated, depressed, glandular area, surrounded by a raised 
border; this is sometimes tinged with bright red, in alcohol; the rest 
of the foot is usually tinged with chocolate-brown. 

Gill large, bipinnate, deep purple. 

This species grows to a great size. One, from station 939, was over 
5 inches (128'"™) long; 4 inches (102""") wide; and about 2 inches (50"^™) 
high, even after preservation in alcohol.

IMartha's Vineyard, in 86 to 310 fathoms. It was most numerous at sta- 
tions 949 and 1040, in 100 and in 93 fathoms. 

It occurs on the European coasts, ofi' Portugal and in the Mediterra- 
nean Sea: from 50 to 250 fathoms. 



]»ES€RIPTIOIV8 OF SOME NEW IVOKTH A.IIERICAIV BIRDS. 

By ROBERT RIB>«WAY. 

1. Catherpes mexicanus punctulatus, snbsp. uov. 

Ch. — In coloration, somewhat intermediate between C. mexicanus 
(typicus) and G. consperstin (paler than the former, darker than the latter), 
but in dimensions agreeing best with the latter. 

Adult: Above dull rusty brown, less reddish anteriorly, the whole 
top of head, nape, back, and scapulars distinctly speckled with white, 
each white dot immediately preceded by an equally distinct one of 
dusky; rump and outer surface of wings ferruginous, the former nearly 
immaculate, the latter rather coarsely barred with black; upper tail- 
coverts chestnut-rufous, each feather with a white terminal and black 
subterminal dot. Tail clear rusty rufous, crossed by about seven or 
eight narrow, irregular bars of black, these less than .05 of an inch 
broad on the middle feathers, and al)out .10 of an inch wide on the outer 
pair. Chin, throat, and jugulum silky white (more or less tinged with 
ochraceous), passing gradually on the breast into soft ochraceous, this 
changing to rich ferruginous on sides, abdomen, and remaining lower 
parts, the parts thus colored marked, more or less distinctly, with black 
dots or bars, and, in some specimens, white terminal specks. Bill dusky, 
the mandible paler; iris brown; legs and feet brownish black or dark 
brown. Wing 2.25-2.40 (2.32), tail 2.00-2.20 (2.12). culmen .75-.85 (.81), 
bill from nostril .52-.65 (.GO), tarsus .68-.72 (.70), middle toe .50-.58 (.53). 
(Five specimens.) 

Hah. — California, north to San Francisco and the Calaveras Eiver. 

The Califoruian specimens of this species appear to differ uniformly 
from examples obtained in the Interior, in the characters indicated above. 
They are all decidedly darker in coloration, approaching in this respect 
the typical G. mexicanus of Mexico, but they are much smaller tJian the 
latter race. Compared with a series of seven examples of G. conspersiis, 
as to dimensions, five examples of punctulatus average the same in length 
of wing, .05 of an inch less in length of tail, the middle toe and tarsus

each .02 longer, and the calmen .09 of an inch longer. It is quite likely, 
however, that a larger series of each would negative these apparent 
slight differences. 

Types, 82715, $ ad., Forest Hill, Placer County, California, October 
7, 1862, F. Gruber, and 79154, 9 ad., Calaveras R., 30 miles east of 
Stockton, L. Belding. 

2. Lophophanes inornatus griseus, subsp. nov. 

Ch. — Differing from L. inornatus {typicus) in rather larger size and 
decidedly grayer colors. Above uniform brownish gray ; beneath pale 
grayish, lighter on the middle of the abdomen. Wing 2.80-3.00, tail 
2.40-2.70, culmen .40-.48, tarsus .80- 90. 

^a&.— Middle Province of United States, from Kevada, Utah, and 
Colorado to New Mexico and Arizona. 

All specimens of this species from the Middle Province region differ 
from Californian examples as noted above, the difference being abso- 
lutely constant in the considerable series examined. The distinctions 
between the two races may be stated more precisely as follows : 

Var. INORNATU^S. Above grayish olive- brown, beneath grayish white- 
Wing 2.G8-2.90, tail 2.20-2.60, culmen .38-.40, tarsus .80-.88. Hah.— 
California and Western Oregon. 

Var. GKISEUS. Above brownish gray, beneath paler grayish. Wing 
2.80-3.00, tail 2.40-2.70, culmen .40-.48, tarsus .80-.90. iTaft.— Middle 
Province of United States. 

3. Geothlypis beldingi, sp. nov. 

Sp. cb..— Adult i (No. 87G85, U. S. Nat. Mus., San Jos6del Cabo, Lower 
California; L. Belding): Entire lower parts very rich yellow (much deeper 
than in G. trlchas), paler, but not inclining to white, on the anal region, 
the sides and flanks tinged with brownish; whole forhead, lores, malar 
region, and auriculars deep black, this having exactly the same limits 
and extent as in G. trichas, G. melanops, and G. rostrata, but bordered 
behind for its ichole extent ivith bright yellow, inclining to whitish only 
in a very limited space, immediately back of the auriculars. Entire 
upper parts uniform olive-green (richer and browner than in the allied 
species), anteriorly fading gradually into the yellow behind the black 
mask, the occiput and nape somewhat tinged or indistinctly clouded 
with umber-brown. Bill wholly deep black ; feet brownish. Wing 2.60, 
tail 2.70, its graduation .50, culmen .55, bill from nostril .40, tarsus .95, 
middle toe .65. 

Adult 9 (No. 87686, same locality, «&c.) : Above olive-green, thepileum 
and sides of head more brownish ; lores, suborbital region, etc., brownish 
olive, mixed somewhat with yellowish; malar region and entire lower 
parts bright yellow, more ochrey-whitish about the anal-region. Bill 
black above, brownish below ; feet pale brownish. Wing 2.35, tail 2.40, 
its graduation .30 ; culmen .55, tarsus .95, middle toe .65. 

The two specimens described above have been compared with ex- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 345 

ainples of all the known Mexican GeothlypecVj excepting G. speciosa Scl., 
of which there is probably no specimen in any American collection. The 
latter, so fiir as I am able to judge from descriptions, seems to differ in 
"ochre-yellow" instead of intensely rich gamboge, lower parts,* in the 
smaller size (wing 2.40, tail 2.30, tarsus .So), and apparently in the ab- 
sence of a light band bordering the hinder margin of the black mask, 
which it is said also occupies the top of the head, while in the present 
bird the black extends backward only .30-.35 of an inch from the frontal 
antite. From G. trichas, G. melanops, and G. rostrata, the only other 
related species, the differences are so great as not to need specification. 
Since the above was written three more specimens (skins) have beea 
received from Mr. Belding. The two males agree minutely with the 
one described above, except that the yellow of the lower parts is scarcely 
so intense, though still much deeper than in the allied species. In both 
there is the same very slight whitening (for the space of about .20 of an 
inch) just behind the auricular s, the feathers bordering the black mask 
being elsewhere entirely light yellow. These specimens measure as 
follows :

The female (No. 87534:, San Jose, April 29) differs from the type chiefly 
in having the auriculars and lores quite distinctly darker, forming a 
slight indication of the mask of the male. Wing 2.40, tail 2.50, its grad- 
uation .45; culmen .50, tarsus .90, middle toe .00. 

This fine new species is one well worthy to bear the name of the en- 
thusiastic naturalist who has had tlie good fortune to discover it — Mr. L. 
Belding,of Stockton, Gal., already well known to ornithologists through 
his valuable contributions to our knowledge of Californian birds t — to 
whom I take great pleasure in dedicating it. 

4. Rallus beldingi, sp. nov. 

Cii. — .Most resembling B. elegans, but darker and richer colored 
throughout, the sides and flanks with the white bars much narrower, 
and marked also with very distinct blackish bars. Size, smaller. 

Adult 9 (No. 8G419, Espiritu Santo Islands, Lower California, Febru- 
ary 1, 1882 ; L. Belding) : Pileum and upper half of nape dark sooty 
brown or sepia; ground-color of other upper parts deep olive-browu 
(much as in B. virginianus — decidedly darker than in elegans), broadly

striped with brownish black, about as in B. obsoletKs ; wing-coverts dull 
chestnut-brown, tinged with olive, the exterior feathers more rusty; 
supra-loral stripe light cinnamon, the feathers white at base; lores, con- 
tinuous with a broad stripe behind the eye, dull grayish brown ; under 
eyelid whitish; malar region, cheeks, entire foreneck, jugulum, and 
breast rich cinnamon, much deeper than in any of the allied forms; chin 
white, throat mixed white and cinnamon, the latter on tips of the 
feathers; entire sides and flanks rather dark hair-brown (less olivaceous 
than upper parts), rather distinctly barred with blackish and very 
sharply barred with pure white, the bars of the latter color about .05- 
.07 of an inch in width ; lining of wing dark brown, with very narrow 
white bars; anterior and middle portion of crissum marked much like 
the flanks, the lateral and terminal lower tail-coverts pure white. 
Basal two-thirds of the mandible, and posterior portion of maxillary 
toraium deep orange; rest of bill dark horn-brown, the end of the man- 
dible paler; feet dark horn-brown. Wing 5.70, tail 2.50, culmen 2.15, 
depth of bill at base .50, in middle .30; tarsus 1.92, middle toe 1.80. 

Compared with specimens of all the allied species and races of the 
genus, the present bird is instantly distinguishable by the characters 
ponited out above. In intensity of coloration it most nearly resembles R. 
virginianiis ; but, apart from its much larger size, presents the following 
differences of coloration: The side of the head below the eye is chiefly 
cinnamon, whereas this portion is in R. virginianus very distinctly ashy; 
the breast, etc., are both deeper and redder cinnamon; the ground-color 
of the sides and flanks much paler (uniform black in virginianus)', the 
black stripes of the upper parts are both narrower and less sharply de- 
fined, while the wings are much less rusty. 

Compared with the larger species {R. longirostris, with its races, R. 
elegans and R. obsoletus), it is difficult to say to which it is most nearly 
related. None of the forms of R. longirostna, however, need close com- 
parison, the darkest colored race of that species {saturatuSj from Loui- 
siana) having broader black strii)es and a very different (ash-gray) 
ground-color above; the breast, &c., a very much duller and lighter 
cinnamon, and the flank-bars broader and on a uniform ground-color. 
R. obsokfus agrees best in the coloration of the upper parts, which, how- 
ever, in all specimens (including one from San Quentin Bay, on the west- 
ern side of Lower California) have a lighter, and in some a decidedly 
grayer, ground-color; but the white flank-bars are much broader, with 
unicolored interspaces, the breast very conspicuously i)aler, and the size 
considerably greater. R. elegans has also the breast paler, the ground- 
color of the upper parts a lighter and much more yellowish olive, and 
the black stripes much more sharply defined. U])on the whole, I see no 
other way than to consider the specimen in question as representing a 
very distinct species or local race, which I take great pleasure in naming 
after its collector.

OESCRIPTIOrV OF A NEW SPECIES OF URANIDEA (IJKAIVIB>EA 
KfilOTMEA) FROri SPOKAIVE RIVEK, ^VA.SHIIVOTOIV TERRITORY. 

By ROSA SMITH. 

Head 3 (3f); depth 4^ (oi); length (30737) 3 iuches. D. YIII-IG; A. 
11; V. I, 4; Br. 0. 

Subgenus Cottopsis Girard. 

Body of the usual form in the genus, widest anteriorly, gradually 
tapering to the tail, the greatest width just behind head, 1} in greatest 
depth of body. Head wide, depressed, its depth half its width. Mouth 
moderate, maxillary reaching the vertical of posterior margin of pupil. 
Eye moderate, 1^ in snout. Snout 3} in head, more pointed ami the 
head broader than in U. gulosa or U. aspera. Interorbital space rather 
narrow, 2 in eye, slightly concave. 

Yilliform teeth on jaws and vomer, about as in U. aspera, the pala- 
tine teeth forming a broader and much longer baud than in the latter 
species. 

Opercular spines nearly as in U. aspera; a sharp spine at the angle 
of preopercle directo.l upward and backward, below which are two 
small and very blunt ones. A single spine directed forward at the 
inferior angle of opercle. 

Skin of the head smooth to the touch, but there are numerous very 
minute tubercles on the nose, interocular width, and vertex. An 
a]>pearance of prickles is observed on the space between occiput and 
origin of dorsal, but no roughness can be felt. Conspicuous prickles 
extend from the scapula and origin of dorsal fin almost to base of 
caudal, and below the lateral line a distance equaling the interorbital 
space; these prickles more prominent than in U. aspera. The lower 
surface of head, the abdominal region, and base of anal are smooth 
and without any trace of warts or prickles. 

Isthmus rather broad, the gill-membranes not forming a fold across 
it. First dorsal low, its margin convex; fourth and fifth spines highest, 
about 4 in head. First ray of soft dorsal equaling highest part of 
spinous, increasing to the third, which is 2\ in head, the outline nearly 
straight from third to fifteenth rays. Caudal subtruucate. Anal sim- 
ilar to soft dorsal, its last ray inserted opposite insertion of fourteenth 
dorsal ray, the free tips, not extending quite as far as those of dorsal. 
Ventrals not reaching vent, 2 in head. Pectoral attaining third ray of 
soft dorsal and barely to beginning of anal. 

Caudal peduncle nearly 4 in greatest depth. In young examples the 
opercular spines and dermal prickles are more conspicuous than in the 
adult. 

Color, in spirits, olivaceous with blackish markings. Upper part of 
head dark gray, with a darker area on occiput. Two blackish spots at

base of spinous dorsal, and two larger spots, or almost bands, at base 
of soft dorsal, extending below lateral line, and a black connecting 
band below lateral line, which extends along middle of peduncle, 
spreading out, fan-like, at base of caudal; the general hue of the i)rickly 
region is dark gray ; the thorax, abdomen, and base of anal yellowish- 
white with fine blackish punctulations on these regions in the larger 
specimen, the smaller ones without dots on this area. Fins with small 
black spots which tend to form waving horizontal lines in their arrange- 
ment. Veutrals almost plain yellowish-white. Brauchiostegal mem- 
brane punctate with black in adult. Lining of mouth plain whitish. 
Peritoneum white. 

This species is known to me from four individuals collected from the 
Falls of the Spokane River, in Washington Territory. The largest and 
smallest of these have been presented to the National Museum by Mr. 
W. G. W. Harford, and their catalogue number is 30737. 

The smaller number of flu-rays separates this species readily from 
U. aspera and U. semiscahra (D. X, 21, A. 17 in aspera ; D. YII, 18, 
A. 14 in semiscahra)^ while the very prickly skin at once distinguishes 
it from all others.

ON THIS EASTWARD DISTRIBIJTIOIV OF THE BLACK-TAIL.ED DEER 
(CARIACUS COI.IJMBIAIVIJS). 

By CAPT. CHAS. BEI^DIRi:, U. S. A. 

[Extracted from a letter to Prof. S. F. Baird.] 

I have for the past two years carefully examined a great number of 
hides of the so-called black-tailed deer found in this region, and have 
sent several lots of tails to Judge J. D. Caton, who is the best author- 
ity on the Ccrvid(c we have. The judge is perfectly right in saying, 
''The most extraordinary fact in connection with this deer is the ex- 
tremely narrow limits of its range, and this must be still farther re- 
stricted. I am now satisfied that it reaches no farther than the east- 
ern slopes of the Cascade Mountains instead of the foot-hills of the 
Eockies." I have examined skins from various portions of this country, 
a great many taken near the eastern border of the Cascades, about 
Prineville, Oregon, also the Warm Si)ring Indian Eeservatiou, The Dal- 
les, Camp Harney, Oregon, Yakima Valley, and the Spokane Fort 
region, and I have to see the first true black-tailed deer skin (the Cervus 
columbianns) yet which comes from any point east of the Cascade range. 
I can speak i)ositively about this, as I have made very careful examina- 
tions, and liave looked over several thousands of hides, brought to- 
gether from various places, at the instigation of Judge Caton. If this 
deer occurs at all east of the Cascade range, it will be found about Fort

Klamath, which is located on the eastern slope of this range, and well 
up in the mountains. But I do not think that it will even be found 
there, and it is strange to account for it, but it is true all the same. 
There are two gentlemen stationed at Fort Townsend, Washington 
Territory, who can and will get you specimens, I think. They are 
Col. Alexander Chambers, Twenty-first Infantry, and Capt. Stephen P. 
Jocelyn, same regiment. Come to think of it, they are likely to be re- 
moved any day, as their regiment is to go to Wyoming. I will try and 
see if I can't find some one to do this, and will write to a taxidermist in 
Portland about it, whom I know.

level of lower edge of pectoral, the length of the slit. If in head. 

Lateral line developed beyond the straight part, its posterior portion 
curved downwards. 

Dorsal fin continuous, with a slight but distinct depression between 
the spinous and soft parts, the spines somewhat curved, but stiff and 
strong, the longest spine about 2J- in head; longest soft niys 2 in head.

Numerous specimens of this species were obtained by Mr. Charles H. 



350 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Gilbert and myself iu rock pools, at Santa Barbara, Cal., in the winter 
of 1880. It was at first supposed by us to be identical with Blennius 
gentilis Girard, a species of which we obtained no adult specimens. 
Numerous specimens of Isesthes (jilberti have been distributed under the 
name of Hi/pleurochilus gentilis (number 2G917, U. S. Nat. Mus.). Four 
specimens from Santa Barbara (26916) are the types of the present 
description ; all of them are males. 

The following description of specimens of Isesthes gentilis may be 
compared with the foregoing. 

Head 3| in length {U with caudal); depth 4 (4|-). D. XIII, 17; A. 
11, 19. Length (26645) 3f inches. 

Body rather robust, deep and compressed, the head large, very bluntly 
and evenly rounded in profile, more obtuse and more evenly curved 
than in I. giJberti, the snout shorter, about equal to eye, 4^ in head. 
Mouth rather small, terminal, the maxillary reaching to opposite middle 
of eye, its length 3 iu head. Teeth subequal, the hindmost on each side 
of upper jaw shorter than the others, and a little apart from them but 
not forming "a small canine" as stated by Girard. 

Superciliary tentacle long and simple in all specimens examined, its 
length about 3 in head. (Tentacles much smaller in the female, accord- 
ing to Steindachner.) 

Gill-opening extending downward not quite to lower edge of pectoral, 
its length (vertical) 2^ in head. Lateral line with only the straight 
anterior portion developed, not curved downward posteriorly. 

Dorsal fin continuous, with scarcely a trace of emargination between 
the spinous and soft parts. Dorsal spines comparatively low and flex- 
ible, much less strong than in I. gilberti, the longest spines 3 in head; 
longest soft rays If. Caudal free from dorsal and anal. If in head. 
Yentrals 1| in head ; pectorals 1^. 

Coloration, in spirits, brown, the whole body closely mottled and 
blotched with darker brown, so that the light ground color forms, 
especially anteriorly, light reticulations around darker spots. On the 
head the dark spots are small and close together, smallest anteriorly, 
the lower parts of the head being immaculate. Extending from the 
curve of the preopercle downward, across the interopercle and branchial 
region, is a sharply defined white bar (said to be golden-yellow in life), 
edged with black. Behind this and parallel with it across subopercle and 
isthmus is a similar bar. These bars (which, according to Steindachner, 
are characteristic of the male) are present iu all specimens examined, 
A few pale spots or bars in front of these. Back with about 6 dusky 
cross-shades; below each of these is an oblong dark blotch, the anterior 
placed along the lateral line, all together forming an interrupted dark 
stripe. A similar dark stripe near the median line of the body, inter- 
rupted by some pale blotches. Fins all blotched and spotted with light 
and dark colors, but without distinct markings (a blue spot on front 
of dorsal in life, according to Steindachner). Ventrals and anal nearly

plain blackish in males, the base of the anal with a pale streak. Two 
specimens from Cape San Lucas, supposed to be the female of this 
species, have the tentacles much shorter, not longer than pui)il, lack 
the pale stripes on the head, and have a very distinct blackish blotch 
on front of spinous dorsal.

7. Scales G-53-1 5. Length of largest specimen 8 inches. 

Body comparatively elongate, elliptical, little compressed, the dorsal 
and ventral outhnes regularly and nearly equally curved, the back not 
much elevated and not specially comj^ressed. Head rather short, broad, 
not very acute anteriorly, the profile nearly straight from snout to base 
of dorsal ; snout short, about equal in length to the large eye, 34 in head. 
Interorbital area broad and quite liat, its width 41- in head. Mouth 
moderate, terminal, oblique, the lips moderately developed. Maxillary 
extendiug to opposite front of eye, 2f in head. Premaxillaries in front 
on level of middle of eye. 

Teeth in moderate bands, those in the outer series enlarged, but much 
less so than in C. nohilis, the teeth slenderer than in the latter; two 
teeth in front of lower jaw somewhat canine-like. Preorbital narrow, 
its least width about two-fifths diameter of eye. Jaws equal in front. 

Preopercle with its posterior margin somewhat concave, armed with 
strong teeth, which are directed backward and somewhat upward. An- 
gle of preopercle with a strong spine directed backward, its length about 
half length of eye. Lower limb of preopercle with strong spinous teeth 
(as in the species of Plectropoma)^ directed forward and downward, be- 
coming gradually smaller anteriorl3^ Nostrils small, roundish, the an- 
terior largest. Gill-rakers rather slender, of moderate length.

the angulation of the lateral line. Small scales on soft parts of dorsal 
and anal. 

Dorsal fin low, divided almost to base, the spines rather strong. First 
and second spines short and slender, the second little more than one- 
third the height of the third ; the fourth or longest 2^ in head ; soft dor- 
sal low, its longest rays 3 in head. Caudal subtruncate, the upper rays 
longest. If in head. Anal rather low, the second spine 2 in head, much

The types of this species (17546; U. S. Nat. Mus.), three adult speci- 
mens in good condition, were obtained by Dr. Thomas H. Streets at 
Boca Soledad, on the Pacific coast of Lower California. They have 
been mentioned by Dr. Streets (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., vii, 50, 1877) 
under the name of Conodon phimieri. They are closely related to the 
latter species, but distinguishable as follows : 

Common characters. — Body ratber elongate; preopercle with 
strong antrorse teeth on its lower limb and a spine at its angle ; series 
of scales above lateral line parallel with it ; outer series of teeth in 
both jaws enlarged ; dorsal deeply notched ; soft rays of vertical fins 
scaly ; second anal spine enlarged. (Conodon, C. & V.) 

a. Back distinctly elevated and compressed, the depth equal to length of head, 3^ in 
body; teeth of outer series very strong and thick; second dorsal spine more than 
half length of third; second anal spine more than half length of head; pre- 
opercular spine small; dark bars on sides extending to level of lower edge of 

pectoral Nobilis. 

aa. Back not elevated, the depth equal to length of head, 3f in body; teeth of outer 
series moderately enlarged, slender ; second dorsal spine small, less than one-third 
length of third; second anal spine about half length of head; preopercular spine 
very strong; dark bars on sides not extending to level of pectorals. ..Serrifer. 
It may be here observed that of the two specimens referred to Pristi- 
poma lenciscus by Dr. Streets, one (17539) belongs to Pomadasys axil- 
laris (Steind.), the other (30746) to Pomadasys nitidus (Steind). The 
variety of Pomadasys lenciscus from Mazatlan and Panama mentioned 
by us (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1881, 387, foot-note) has received from Dr. 
Steindachner (Neue & Seltene Fische, aus. K. K. Museum, Wien, &c., 
1879. 30, 52. taf 9. f. 2) the name of Prisfipoma lenciscus var. elongatiis. 
As it is apparently a valid species, although very closely related to P. 
lenciscus , it may stand as Pomadasys elongatus. It is much more abun- 
dant than the typical lenciscus.

By I>AVSB> S. jrOBSIJAlV ami CHARLES If. C1II.E5ERT. 

Mr. John Xautus, when stationed at Cape Sau Lucas as a tidal 
observer for the Coast Survey, brought together a very large collection 
of objects of natural history, among which was a most excellent series 
of the fishes of the coast. The collections were formed under the 
auspices and direction of the Smithsonian Institution. They were 
studied by Professor Gill, who published descriptions* of most of the 
species in Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 
delphia in 1862 and 1863. Later, during a period of confusion in the 
Museum, this collection was scattered and many of the specimens lost 
or destroyed, and the study of the undescribed portion was abandoned 
by Professor Gill. The writers have gone over the entire collection 
again, and give here a catalogue of what remains. Even after the 
extensive collections studied by Giiuther, Steindachner, and the writers, 
there still remain in the Xantus collection several species new to 
science. 

It may be observed that the descrii^tions published by Professor Gill 
are, for the most part, taken from immature fishes. This accounts for 
many discrepancies between these descriptions and those taken from 
adults of the same species. Most of the specimens obtained by Xantus 
were taken from tide pools and rocks, and few or none bought in the 
markets. 

1. Elops saurus L. 

2521. Small specimens. 

2. Clupea thrissina sp. no v.

present also on palatines, pterygoids, and tongue, the teeth on the 
pterygoids very conspicuous, forming a large patch. 

Eye large, 3 in head. Cheeks much longer than deep, not as deep as 
eye, the anterior margin of the preopercle very oblique. Opercle short 
and deep, shorter than eye, its posterior margin nearly vertical. Cheeks 
and opercles marked with fine, but distinct, branching striie. 

Gill-rakers rather short, slender, and close-set, about 30 below the 
angle of the arch. Longest gill-raker about half diameter of eye. 

Scales firm and adherent, their posterior margins less convex than 
usual, rough with small fine teeth. Scales before dorsal similar to the 
others, but much smaller. Belly sharply compressed, the scutes strong,

species known to us, but not in condition for description. 

4. Pristigaster ? sp. incog. 

15443. A young specimen in very bad condition, which we are unable 
to identify with any of the known species of this type. 

Body elongate, with a very distinct silvery stripe. Lowerjaw strongly 
projecting, its teeth very strong, much stronger than upper teeth. Ven- 
tral outline not very prominent, strongly serrate. Ventral fins now 
wanting, but perhaps destroyed. It may possibly be a species of Cliiro- 
centrodon. 

5. Synodus scituliceps Jor. & Gilb. 

A single young specimen in bad condition, apparently belonging to 
this species. 

6. Characodon furcidens, sp. uov.

to the nape, the region thence to the dorsal gibbous, especially iu the 
larger examples, the caudal peduncle comparatively long and slender, 
about as long as head. 

Anterior teeth large, firmly fixed, all bicuspid or Y-shaped, in a single 
series; a band of minute villiform teeth behind them, at least in upper 
jaw. Mandible not extending back to front of eye. Eye rather large, 
3^^ in head, Interorbital area wide, very nearly half head. 

Scales rather small, those on top of head not much larger than the 
others; humeral scale not enlarged. Opercle connected by membrane 
to shoulder girdle, from upper base of pectoral upward, as in Cijprinodon. 
Insertion of dorsal very fiir back, midway between base of caudal and 
base of pectoral. First ray of dorsal very slender and articulate, not 
at all spine-like. Dorsal fin low, not so high as long, its base 1§ iu 
head. Anal inserted below seventh ray of dorsal. Pectorals 1% in 
head; ventrals 2. Caudal obliquely truncate, very slightly emarginate, 
the upper lobe about one fifth longer than the lower, 1^ in head ; upper 
lobe usually more or less sharply angular; lower lobe rounded. 

Coloration in spirits: Males with the sides profusely mottled with 
darker, sometimes nearly plain. Vertical fins each with several brown- 
ish bars and blotches and each with a dusky subterminal bar. A nar- 
row dark line along middle of each row of scales on the back. Females 
with several short dark bars on the posterior half of the body, the fins 
colored as in the male. Some small dark specks on caudal peduncle. 

7. Fundulus parvipinnis Girard. 

7242. Numerous examples, precisely like others from San Diego. 

8. Fundulus vinotus, sp. nov.

Scales comparatively large. Dorsal inserted moderately in advance 
of anal, its front midway between base of caudal and occiput ; the fin 
of moderate height. Pectoral If in liead ; caudal 1|. 

Coloration, in spirits, olivaceous, with about 23 narrow silvery bars 
with undulating edges, the bars narrower than the darker interspaces. 
Fins now all plain. 

This species is apparently related to F. hetcroclitus and other Atlantic 
species. It may be distinguished from most of its relatives by its com- 
paratively large scales. 

9. Fundulus extensus, sp. uov. 

30972. Two specimens, faded and rather soft, the longest nearly 3 
inches long. 
Head 3^; depth 5|-. D. 15: A. 13. Scales about 17-12. 



356 PEOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Body unusually elongate, moderately compressed, tlie caudal peduncle 
long-, much longer tban liead. Head slender, not very broad, the iu- 
terorbital width 2f in head. Eye large, 3 J in head. Month rather large; 
the teeth in a moderate band, the outer considerably enlarged. 

Dorsal flu rather long', of moderate height, its insertion well in front 
of that of anal, at a jwiut midway between eye and base of caudal. 

Pectoral small, If in head. Caudal If. 

Coloration, in spirits, plain, somewhat translucent, with no markings 
anywhere, except traces of some very narrow dark bars on the sides. 
Fins now plain. 

This species resembles somewhat the Eastern Fundulus cliaphanus, but 
it is more elongate. 

10. Hemirhamphus uhifasciatus Eauzaui. 
G3120. An adult example, in fair condition. 

11. Gymuomurasna nectura, sp. liov. 

10-442. One specimen, 6J inches in length, in good condition. 

Body moderately elongate, the snout heavy, compressed, abruptly 
truncate in profile. Anterior nostril on the front of the snout, in a short 
tube; posterior nostril directly above the eye, without tube. 

Eye rather large, about half as long as snout, which is 2f in cleft of 
mouth. Cleft of mouth straight, its length 2| in head. Jaws about even 
in front, the lower having little motion, but capable of completely clos- 
ing the mouth. 

Teeth rather strong, sharp, straight, erect, mostly in two series, and 
nearly all depressible; those on the vomer a little larger than the others. 
Teeth in outer series in each jaw small, much smaller than those of the 
inner series. Gill opening small. Head 2f in trunk; head and trunk 
a little shorter than tail. 

End of tail with a moderate tin, larger than usual in this genus; the 
fin more developed on tlie upper side, where its length is equal to that 
of the head. 

Color dark brown, with ill-defined bars, blotches and reticulations of 
darker brown, the head and breast more distinctly marked. 

Compared with GymnomurKna tigrina, this species has the fin better 
developed, the snout and mouth longer, the teeth larger, the color dif- 
ferent, &c. 

12. Muraena pinta Jordan & Gilbert. 

2324. One half-grown individual, in good condition. Young speci- 
mens of this species have an inner row of smaller teeth in the upper jaw. 

13. Apterichthys selachops, sp. nov. 

4391. One specimen, in good condition, about 14 inches long. 
Body moderately elongate, the tail sharp-pointed. No trace of fins any- 
where. Head tapering anteriorly to the long, sharp snout, which ends

ill a short flexible tip. Snout projecting much beyond the mouth ; the 
form and position of the mouth and snout and the position of the nos- 
trils giving a physiognomy remarkably shark-like. Cleft of the mouth 
oblique, somewhat curved downwards and backwards posteriorly. Teeth 
all small, pointed, their tips directed backward ; apparently in about one 
series in each jaw and a narrow band on the vomer. Lower jaw ante- 
riorly pointed, incapable of much motion. Width of lower jaw between 
angles of mouth. If in its length. Length of snout from eye, If in 
length of cleft of mouth. Cleft of mouth 4 in head. 

Anterior nostrils without tube, posterior each in a short tube; both 
pairs on the lower side of the snout. Eyes minute, but evident, some- 
what behind the vertical from the front of the lower jaw. 

Gill-openiugs ventral, close together in front, slightly divergent be- 
liind, the slits about as long as snout. Lateral line conspicuous. 

Head 5 in head and trunk; head and trunk 1^ in tail. 

Color uniform plain brown; the head slightly paler and mottled. 

The specimen is a female full of ova; the ovaries extend backward in 
the abdominal ca\'ity far behind vent. 

14. Ophichthys miurus, sp. nov. 

2304. Three specimens, in good condition, the largest about a foot 
long. 

Body moderately elongate. Head long and slender, anteriorly pointed. 
Lower jaw included; cleft of mouth 21 in head. 

Teeth all slender and pointed, directed backwards, most of them not 
depressible, those of the upper jaw in two widely separated series, those 
of the inner series largest, slender and close-set. Vomer with a median 
series of about 4 slender teeth. Lower jaw with a single series of rather 
long, slender teeth, wide apart, larger than the teeth of the upper jaw, 
but smaller than those of the vomer. 

Snout very short, nearly twice the length of eye, 4 times in cleft of 
mouth. Eyes small, placed high and well forward. Nostrils without 
tubes. Lateral line conspicuous. Gill-openings small, placed very low, 
separated by an intersiiace, less than the length of one slit, which is 
about as long as snout. 

Pectoral fin very small, pointed, about as long as snout. Gill-open- 
ing midway between tip of snout and beginning of dorsal. Fins very 
low; tip of tail pointed. Tail unusually short. Head of in head and 
trunk. Tail If in rest of body, a little shorter tha,n trunk without head. 

Coloration light yellowish; a series of roundish dark brown blotches 
on each side of body, the two series alternating; a series of small half- 
blotches on the back, these also mostly alternating. Head covered with 
small spots; dark spots on sides of lower jaw; fins all pale. 

This would be a species of '■'■ Hcrpetoiclitliys'''' in Dr. Kaup's arrange- 
ment.

to I)ecaj)terus macarellus (C. & V.) Gill, of the Atlantic coast, of which 
it may well be taken as a geographical representative or variety. The 
only ditterences which we are able to appreciate are the following: 

Body rather less slender in D. hypodus (depth 5^ instead of 5^) ; teeth 
rather stronger (distinctly seen on lower jaw and tongue; scarcely to be 
felt anywhere in D. macarellus); caudal armature stronger, about 30 
plates baving distinct keels (not more than 25 in I), macarellus); lateral 
line becoming straight more or less behind middle of trunk (near middle 
of body in I), macarellus). 

It is possible that a large series would show that the two forms are 
absolutely identical.

2511. (Type of Hakttractus dorsalis.) A very young example, in good 
condition, 3^ inches in length. 

The banded coloration of this specimen is usual in immature Seriokc. 
The large number of dorsal rays distinguishes this species from Seriola 
mazatlana Steiud. It is apparently the young of the Californian "Yel- 
low Tail," which we have formerly identified with Seriola lalandi C 
& V. Until specimens of the two forms can be actually compared, it 
is better to retain the Pacific species under a separate name as Seriola 
dorsalis. 

Head 3 J ; depth 4. Tail scarcely carinated ; vertical fins little ele- 
vated anteriorly, not falcate. Head about one-fourth longer than deep, 
somewhat carinated at the occiput; (this carina probably disappearing

3689. (Type of Eltypt'wus maculatus.) One young specimen, about 2h 
inches long, in bad condition. 

This specimen is undoubtedly the young of the species called nigri- 
innnis and decoratus by Professor Gill, a species very closely related to 
Bhypticus maculatus Holbr. of the Atlantic, but distinct from it. 

The number of dorsal rays is II, 25, not III, 24, as given by Professor 
Gill. The first soft ray having been detached and broken, was taken 
for a third sjiine, but its articulated tip is still attached.

specimen with one from Cuba, and, with Professor Gill, are unable to 
point out any differences likely to be permanent. The Californian 
specimen is somewhat deeper, with deeper and blunter head, and the 
pale spots on the sides are smaller than in the other, otherwise the two 
seem to be identical.

exami)le, about two inches long, the fore part of the head injured. It 
has a blunt head, forked caudal, scaly maxillary, large scales, high 
lateral line, and other characters of Anthias, to which genus it should 
l)robably be referred.

in length, in lair condition. These evidently belong to the same species 
as the adult examples lately described by us from Panama as Xeniclitliys

The dorsal rays are XI-I, 17, instead of XII, 14, as stated by Pro-

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 361 

The very youug specimens on vdiicli this species was based, evidently 
belong to the species which we have lately described as Lutjamis prieto, 
an identification which could not be made from the description published. 
The dark bands are a character of extreme youth. 

Serranus calopteryx Jor. & Gilb. (Proc. U. S. Xat. Mus. iv, 1881, 350) 
seems to be identical with Prionodes fasciatus Jenyns (Voyage of the 
Beagle, Fishes, 1842, 46). The absence of the vomerine and palatine 
teeth in Jenyns' type is, as has been suggested by Dr. Giinther, purely 
accidental, and without significance. The name fasciatus is preoccu- 
l)ied in the genus Serranus, by Rolocentrus fasciatus Bloch. This spe- 
cies may therefore retain the name Serranus calopteryx.

This species reaches a very large size, and the adult examples are quite

of Pomadasys hilineatus. 

Grayish, the scales with inconspicuous darker spots. A broad black 
band through snout and eye, ending in a black blotch at base of caudal. 
A second band from between nostrils on each side, above eye straight 
to soft dorsal and upper edge of caudal peduncle. Fins, especially 
anal, a little dusky. A dark blotch hidden by angle of opercle. All

6558. Numerous immature exami^les, from 1 to 4 inches long, showing

7313. Four specimens, partly grown. 

All the specimens examined have 14 spines in the dorsal, and the 
membranes of the soft dorsal and anal seem to be without scales. 

The young of this species is silvery, with three regular parallel black- 
ish stripes, the lower from eye to middle of base of caudal, the next 
from above eye to upper x)art of caudal pednncle, the third higher uj), 
to middle of soft dorsal. The adults are nearly plain with traces of 
about 6 narrow, dusky, wavy streaks, which do not follow the rows of 
scales. 

The specimen from Guaymas (Xo. 29386), i-eferred to by us in a pre- 
vious paper (Proc. U. S. Xat. Mus. 1881, 274) as Pomadasys inornatus, 
belongs apparently to Pomadasys cantharinus (Jenyns) J. & G.

30927. (Tyjjes of Genytremiis interruptus.) Nine young specimens, 3 to 4 
inches in length. These young specimens resemble to a remarkable 
degree the young of the Atlantic species, P. bilineatus, with which they 
were comj^ared by Professor Gill. Compared with specimens of the 
latter species they differ only in the larger size of the scales, above the 
lateral line mesiallj\ In bilineatus there are usually 6 scales in a ver- 
tical series between the spinous dorsal and the lateral line. In the types 
of interruptus we find 4, 5, or 6 scales in such a series. In Pomadasys 
fiirthi we find 4. Filrtlii differs from bilineatus, so far as we can see, 
only in a slightly different color, more arched back, and rather larger 
scales between the spinous dorsal and lateral line. We are unable at 
present to decide whether the types of interruptus are the young of 
fiirtM or of bilineatus. If the former, which is not unlikely, the occur- 
rence of the latter species in the Pacific is yet to be verified, although 
not improbable. All the definite records of bilineatus on the west coa.st 
of tropical America refer to young specimens, with lateral stripes like 
the types of bilineatus. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 363 

The coloration of the types of '..iferruptm is as follows : 
Dull grayish, somewhat bluish above ; scales auteriorly with iucoii- 
spiciious darker spots. A wavy, sharjily-defiued black band through 
snout and eye, to opposite last ray of dorsal, where it ends abruptly. 
Behind it, at base of caudal, is a large oval black blotch. A similar 
black stripe from above eye straight to middle of base of soft dorsal. 
Veutrals black, other fins more or less tinged with dusky, the pectorals 
and spinous dorsal ])alest. If these prove to be the young of Poma- 
dasys f'Hrtlii, the name interrtiptus is to be substituted for f'drthi. This 
question cannot be settled with the material now at hand.

inches in length, in good condition. This species has not been obtained 
by any other collector. It is well distinguished from the common Upe- 
neus grandisquamis Gill. Compared with the young oi grandisquamis of 
the same &ize, dentatus is more slender, less comjiressed, with smaller 
scales^ very much larger eye, much weaker teeth, and the dorsal out- 
line less arched.

299G. Two small specimeus. 

Compared with the young of Umhrina dorsalls, the young of U. xanti 
differ iu the following respects: 

The body is more slender and elongate (dei)th 3f ; 3^ in dorsaUs), the 
head is more elongate, the anterior profile much less blunt and rounded, 
the eye much smaller (not much longer than snout), the pectoral shorter, 
(2 in head ; If in dorsaUs), the anal spine shorter. The oblique streaks 
along the rows of scales are narrower and more sharplj- defined in xanti 
than in dorsaUs. The number of dorsal rays in dorsaUs is constantly 
greater. 

Adult examples of the two species obtained by Mr. Gilbert show the 
following differential characters: 

a. Suout very blunt, not lonsjer than eye, 4 iu head; preopercle with its nicmbraua- 
ceous edges crenulate ; jjectorals more than two-thirds length of head. D. X-I, 
30 to 33; A. II, 7. Scales 9-53-12. Dark stripes along rows of scales very faint, 

broader than the pale interspaces. Depth 3 iu length Dorsalis. 

aa. Snout rather acute, longer than eye, 3^ in head ; preopercle with its bony edge 
serrate; pectorals less than two-thirds length of head. D. X — I, 26; A. IT, 6. 
Scales 6-48-10. Dark stripes along rows of scales very distinct, narrower than 
the pale interspaces. Depth 3Jin length Xaxti. 

l!^either species appears to be very common along the coast. 

47. Myriopristis occidentalis Gill. 

{Alijrio2]ris1is occidcnialis Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1863, 87: IBhampliohenjx Icu-

G350. (Types of Myriopristis occidentaUs.) Many young siiecimens. 

0304. (Types oi Bhamphoheryx Jcucopus.) Two specimens, each about 
2 inches iu length. 

These specimens appear to belong to the same species. In all the 
specimens called occidentaUs the sides are dull and dusky with dark 
punctulations. In the types of leucopns the sides have a silvery luster. 
There is no tangible difference in form, so far as we can judge from 
these small specimens. 

48. Myriopristis pcscilopus (Gill) J. &, G. 

{UhamphohcriixpcccUopns Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1863, 87: Hhamphoherijx Icu- 
copit.s Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1863, 88.) 

G273. {Types of RhampJiobcryx 2)C£cilopus.) Three specimens, each about 
2 inches in length, in good condition. 

In these specimens the spinous dorsal is all black and the ventrals 
tipped with black. PcecHopns is probably a species distinct from J/. 
occidentaUs, although the resemblance is remarkably great, the ditfer- 
ences, except in color, being scarcely appreciable. 

Compared with occidentaUs of the same size, p(jeciIopus has the lower 
jaw a tritie shorter and the eye a little larger. In poccilopus the sides

liave a bright silvery luster, without dark punctulatious, as iu the 
specimens called leucopus. 

There is no warrant for the generic name Rhamplioheryx. It is strictly 
synonymous with Myriopristls.

(Chromis atriJohata Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1862, 149; 1863, 220.) 

3075. (Type of Chromis atrilobata.) A half-grown specimen, in bad 
condition. 

Ko second specimen of this species has yet been obtained. It may 
be identical with the Brazilian Chromis marf/inatus, as suggested by 
Dr. Giinther, but it is certainly premature to unite the two on tLe ba.sis 
of our present knowledge. A few species of shore-fishes are certainly 
common to the fauujie of Brazil and Lower California, but the suppo- 
sition is against identity in any individual case. Much injury has been 
done to our knowledge of geographical distribution by the random 
identification of specimens with closely related species belonging to 
some other fauna. Of 50 species of marine fishes given by Dr. Giinther 
(Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 1809, 385-392) as common to both sides of the 
Isthmus of Panama, at least 11 have been incorrectly identified and 
are not found on both coasts, the identity of 18 more is doubtful and 
must be verified, while but 21 of the list can be positively stated to be 
specifically identical. A large number not included in this list are also 
certainly identical, but in this case it is better to retain some doubtful 
species than to make many doubtful identifications. 

We may notice that the green coloration of the type of Chromis 
atrilobata (Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1863, 220) seems to have come 
from the copper tank in which it has been kept.

These two forms have been well described by Professor Gill. We 
are uuable to find any constant difference between them except in the 
color. It is not improbable that pectoralis is the male and diplotwnia 
the female of the same species. The form aaWQd pectoralis is certainly 
the male.

8082. (Types.) Very many young examples, in poor condition. 

30929. Three adult males and one female (not types). 

The large specimens last mentioned were received after the publica- 
tion of Professor Gill's papers. The female exami)le is plain light 
browni.sh like the original types. The males are darker, with a narrow 
vertical blue or violet line at the base of each scale, these most distinct 
and broadest on caudal peduncle. A conspicuous jet-black spot, rather 
larger than the eye, at base of caudal, just below lateral line. Three 
concentric blue curved lines on flap of cpercle. Three narrow blue lines 
downward and forward from eye across cheek. Lower jaw aud lower 
side of head with blue strii)es and lines, the one connecting angles of the 
mouth below broader than the others. Fins pale ; now plain. 

In the male the body is deeper than in the female, and the anterior 
profile is steeper. The largest of the original types is a male, and still 
shows traces of the dark caudal spot.

Most of the scales of the back and sides with a vertical light bluish 
stripe, not so distinct as in X. nmndiceps. In the middle of the first 
dark band, just above the lateral line, are one or two scales of a differ- 
ent color, the posterior half of each being jet black, the base light blue, 
the colors abruptly defined. Dorsal with narrow dark stripes running 
obliquely downward and backward. Anal i)ale, with a conspicuous 
light horizontal stripe near the tips of the rays; a narrower similar 
stripe near the middle of the fin. Some bluish clouds on opercle.

I.IST OF FISnES COt.I.ECTEI> BY JOHIV XAIVTUS AT COI^IMA, 

MEXICO. 

By DAVID S. JOKDAN aeid CHARI.ES H. OILBERT. 

About twenty years ago a considerable collection of fishes was made 
by Mr. John Xantus at Colima, on the west coast of Mexico, for the 
Smithsonian Institution. Much of this collection arrived at Washing- 
ton in bad condition, and the greater part of it has gone to decay. In 
the present iiaper is given a catalogue of the specimens still remaining. 

1. Ginglymostoma cirratum (Gmel.) Miiller & Henle. 

7332. Two young examples, each 10 inches long. This species has 
not hitherto been recorded from the Pacific coast of Mexico. A young 
specimen was seen by Mr. Gilbert at Mazatlan. 

2. Arius guatemalensis Giiuther. 
8141. Four specimens. 

3. Characodon furcidens Jor. &- Gilb. 

5093. Very many examples in fair condition, the largest 3 inches 
long. 

4. Muraeua pinta Jor. & Gilb. 

7328. One specimen, 8 inches long. 

5. Rhypticus xanti Gill. 

7710. One fine specimen, 8 inches long. 

6. Epinephelus sellicauda Gill. 
9583, 9587, 9580, 9601.

7. Diabasis sexfasciatus (Gill) J. tS: G. 
30997. Oue liall'-grown specimen. 

8. Diabasis steindachneri Jor. & Gilb. 
9580, 9588, 9600, 19632. 

9. Diabasis maculicauda (Gill) J. & G. 
Three specimens, in very bad condition. 

10. Pomadasys virginicus Snbsp, taeniatus (Gill) J. & G. 

31013. One specimen. 

We have compared Pacific coast representatives of this species {Ani- 
sotremiis Ueniatus Gill) with specimens from the Bahamas. The former 
appear to have very slightly smaller scales (11-56-18 against 9-56-16), 
but we can find no other structural difference, and this may not be con- 
stant. The Atlantic form has the vertical bauds much darker, almost 
black, instead of brown. The blue lateral stripes are wider and fiiinter, 
as broad as a scale and more than two-thirds the width of the inter- 
spaces ; they are very faintly edged with darker. The additional smaller 
l)lue stripes between the broader stripes are more numerous than in the 
Pacific form. In the latter the blue stripes are much less wide than a 
scale and barely one-third the olive stripes. The coloration in Pacific 
coast specimens is very uniform, and the name tcvniatus mny be retained 
for the subsi)ecies which they represent. 

11. Pomacanthus strigatus (Gill) J. & G. 

31008. A fine large specimen, 8 inches in length ; pale bar downward 
from dorsal very distinct ; dorsal and anal with a narrow edging of bright 
blue posteriorly. Blue stripes on head wholly obsolete. 

12. Pomacentrus rectifrcenuni Gill. 

Young specimens, in very poor condition. 

13. Philypnus lateralis Gill. 

8057. One example, 9 inches long. 

14. Dormitator maculatus (Blocli) J. & G. 
Specimens in bad condition. 

15. Culius eequidens Jor. & Gilb. 
5089. In bad condition. 

16. Fierasfer areuicola Jor. & Gilb. 

7531. Two specimens, the largest 4| inches long. 

These specimens agree well with the typical example, but the mouth 
is larger, the maxillary extending much beyond orbit, its length nearly 
two-thirds that of head.

tlST OF FISHE!^ COLI.ECTES* AT PAIVAMA BY C APTAIIV JOHN M. 
DOW, NOW IN THE UNBTEO STATES NATIONAI. MUSEUITI. 

By DAVID S. JOKDAN afiad CHARLES H. GILBERT. 

About twenty years ago (1861-18G5) several collections of fishes were 
forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution by Capt. J. M. Dow, from 
Panama and other points on the west coast of Central America. One 
of these collections has been studied by Professor Gill.* The others 
haA-e hitherto remained unnoticed and many of the specimens have 
been allowed to decay. The present paper gives an account of what 
remains at present. 

1. Mustelus dorsalis Gill. 

(Musteliis dorsalis Gill, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1864.) 

8068. (Types of Mustelus dorsalis.) Four half-grown specimens. 

2. Anableps dowi Gill. 

{AnahJcps dowi Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1861, 4.) 

8005. Five specimens, the largest nearly 11 inches long, from La Union, 
San Salvador. 

3. Hemirhamphus poeyi Giinther. 
30953. Two fine adult specimens. 

This species is very close to S. unifasciatus^ if really distinct. It differs 
chiefly in the shortness of the lower jaw. 

Four specimens of Exocoetus, representing three species, are also 
in the collection, but it is questionable whether any of them really came 
from Panama. We are informed by Captain Dow that the specimen 
which became the type of Exocoetus alUdactylus Gill (Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. 
Phila. 1863, 167) was taken oft' the northern coast of Brazil, and not at 
Panama. 

4. Agonostoma nasutum Giiu+her. 

30966. One specimen. 

5. Joturus stipes si), nov. 

31010. One large specimen, found in the same bottle as 30057 {Poma- 
dasys Immilis). 

19915. Two still larger examples, in good condition, about 15 inches in 
length, from "Central America"; the exact locality and the collector 
unknown. 

Head 4f in length; depth 4; D. lY-l, 9. A III, 9. Scales 45—13.

374 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Body robust, a little compressed behind. Head lieavy, little com- 
pressed, gibbous above and anteriorly. Snout thick, broad, protruding, 
blunt and tumid at tip, considerably overhanging the small inferior 
mouth, and entirely below the level of the eye. Length of snout 2§ in 
head. Maxillary reaching nearly to posterior margin of eye, 2^ in head, 
hidden entirely beneath the preorbital. Mouth broad, but without much 
lateral cleft. Lower jaw included. Ui^per lip thick, slipping beneath 
the snout. Lower lip very thick, its anterior edge forming a soft sharp- 
edged fold; outline of the lip very obtuse. Teeth rather strong, coarse, 
bluntly conical, forming a large ovate patch on each side of lower jaw, 
the two patches not confluent. A similar but smaller patch on the 
vomer. No teeth on the palatines. Upper jaw with a band of similar 
but rather smaller teeth. 

Nostrils roundish, close together, in front of the small round eye, 
which is nearer angle of mouth than level of top of head. Interorbital 
space very broad, transversely convex. Eye 6 in head, 3 in interor- 
bital width. No adipose eyelid. Neither lip with cirri or papillie. 

Scales of head each with many smaller ones at base; accessory scales 
on body largely developed. All the fins, including spinous dorsal, cov- 
ered with small scales. Gill membranes largely united, free from the 
isthmus. 

Dorsal spines compressed and curved, becoming rapidly shorter from 
the first, which is about two-thirds length of head. Second dorsal and 
anal with their free margins concave, the anal somewhat falcate, its 
longest ray 1^ in head. Caudal forked, as long as head. Pectoral as 
long as head, reaching middle of first dorsal. 

Color dull olivaceous, without distinct markings, paler below. 

6. Mugil brasiliensis Agassiz. 

15121, 15122, 15128. Several young specimens. 

7. Muraenesox coniceps Jor. &. Gilb. 

30981. One large specimen, in poor condition.

condition. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 375 

12. Trachynotus ovatus (L.) Lac. 

30970. One partly grown specimen, in good condition. 

15123. Three very yonng specimens. 

Comiiared with Atlantic specimens of somewhat larger size, Xo. 30970 
is somewhat deeper (depth If in length, instead of 1^), and the dorsal 
and anal fins are much less elevated in front (anterior lobe of dorsal 4^ 
in length; 2^^ in T. ovatus from Cuba). 

13. Caranx dorsalis (Gill) Gthr. 

(Carangoklcs dorsalis Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Pliila. 1863, 166.) 

4957. (Types of Carangoides dorsalis.) Two specimens, in good condi- 
tion. 

14. Caranx speciosus Lac. 

(Caranx pa7tam&nsi8 Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1863, 166.)

15. Caranx faUax C. & V. 

{Carangus marginatus Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phil. 1863, 166.) 

30958. (Type of Carangus marginatus.) One adult example, in good 
condition. 

There can be no doubt that Dr. Giinther's identification of Scomber 
hippos L. with this species is erroneous. 

16. Caranx atrimanus J. & G. 

30745. One specimen, 5^ inches long, in good condition. ' 

17. Rhypticus nigripinnis Gill. 

{Promicro2)ierus decoratus Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phil. 1863, 164.)

long, in good condition. 

18. Alphestes multiguttatus (Gthr.) J. &, G. 

30988. One specimen, in fair condition, but somewhat faded. 

30954. A young specimen, in good condition. 

This species is closely allied to the West Indian Alpliestes afer Bloch, 
{Plectropoma chloropterum 0. & V.), but is readily distinguished by the 
more i)ointed snout and the totally different coloration. 

19. Epinephelus analogus Gill. 

{E2Ji>iephclus analogus Gill, Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila. 1863, 163.) 

4944. (Type of Epinephelus analogus.) A half-grown specimen, in good 
condition. 
30993. One fine young specimen. 

20. Pomadasys humilis (Kner & Steindachner) J. «& G. 

30957. A fine adult specimen, and one young specimen. 
The resemblance of this species to Pomadasys crocro (C. & V.) is very 
close.

21. Kuhlia xenura Jor. & Gilb. 

(Xenichihys xenurua Jortlau & Gilbert, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1881, 454.) 

435G, (Types of A'emc/if/ii/s xenurus.) Two specimens, in good condition. 

This species should be referred to the genus KuMia Gill {—JlJoronopsis 
Gill), rather than to Xenichthys. It has no enlarged scale in the ven- 
tral axil, and it has the naked snout, jaws, and fins, the compressed 
body, and high dorsal spines of the species of Kulilia. 

An examination of the Museum records shows that these specimens 
now bear a number originally given to one of the types of " EuscJiistodus 
concolor,^^ from San Salvador. As the connection of these specimens 
with the Dow collection rests on the same records, we consider it doubt- 
ful whether they really came from San Salvador.* Kuhlia xenura appears 
to be a valid species distinct from K. twniura, but it should be suppressed 
from the list of species inhabiting the Pacific coast of Central America, 
until its occurrence there is verified bj" some collector.

5922. (Type of Fomacanthodes zonipectus.) A large specimen, in good 
condition, from San Salvador. 

29979. A young specimen (from IsTicaragua), showing the coloration 
of the '■'•crescentalis'''' stage, which is wholly different from that of the 
adult. The changes in coloration appear to be analogous to those of 
Fomaeantlius arcuatus. 

* There is some reason for thinking that these specimens belonged to Dr. Stimpson's 
olclection, and came from the east coast of Asia.

By DAVBB S. JORDAN ami CHARLES H. GH.BERT. 

1. Muraena dovii Giiuther. 
{Alurwiui pUitUa Jor. & Gilb.) 

30480. A young specimen from Espiritu Santo Island, agreeing fairly 
with the original description of Murcvna pintita^ but the tail slightly 
shorter than the rest of the body. There are a few small yellowish spots 
on the posterior part of the head, similar to those on the body, which 
are not very numerous. 

We have examined two very large eels (19893) collected by Captain 
Hereudeen at the Galapagos Islands. They seem to be referable to 
Murccna dovii., agreeing as well with Giinther's description as they do 
with each other, and there seems to be little room for doubt that our 
'■'■ Murwiia pintita''^ is the young of the same species. There is consider- 
able variation in the size and form of the small pale spots.

cies. No other specimen of this genus lias been brought from the Pacific 
coast of tropical America. 

3. Mugil albula L. 

o0932. Four small specimens, each about 5 inches long, from Cape 
San Lucas. 

4. Mugil brasiliensis Agassiz. 

30933. Three half-grown and numerous young specimens were col- 
lected in San Jose Eiver, near Cape San Lucas. 

5. Agonostoma nasutum Giinther. 

30934. Five sj^ecimens, the largest about 7 inches long, were collected 
at San Jose, where they are known as trucha, or trout. These do not 
differ essentially from the specimens described by Dr. Giinther; the 
maxillary usually extends slightly beyond front of orbit; head 4^ to 4 J 
in length (to base of caudal); eye 4^ in head; maxillary not longer than 
interorbital width, contained 2f to 3;^ times in head; a band of pterygoid 
teeth often but not always developed ; dorsal spines very strong, not 
flexible, the origin of the fin nearer snout than tail ; caudal well forked, 
the middle rays 1^ in outer. 

6. Remora squalipeta (Dald.) J. & G. 
{Echoieis remora L.) 

30941. A single specimen, 6 inches long, from San Jos^. 

7. Centropomus robalito Jor. & Glib. 

30940. Two small specimens, 3J inches long, were obtained at San 
Jose. 

8. Gobius banana Cuv. & Val. 

30935. Color light olivaceous, back and sides blotched and shaded 
with dark brown ; a series of irregular roundish blotches along middle 
of sides; narrow black streaks radiating from eye, two of these running 
downwards and forwards to mouth, and oue backwards to upper pre- 
opercular angle, with a similar i^arallel streak below it; a black streak 
running across upper margin of opercle, and extending on base of upper 
pectoral rays; dark markings on back, sometimes forming more or less 
distinct cross-bars; belly vfhite; ventrals and anal immaculate; other 
fins all more or less distinctly barred with wavy black lines. 

Head 3f in length ; depth 5§. D. VI-11 ; A. I, 10 ; scales Cl-21. 

Body subfusiform, long and low, scarcely or but little cou)i)ressed. 
Head long and low, slender, much narrowed anteriorly, its greatest 
breadth but little more than its greatest depth, and 1^ in its length ; 
cheeks scarcely tumid; snout long, low, 2| in head, the profile very little 
curved. Upper jaw very protractile; lips thick; mouth low, narrow, 
subterminal, very variable in size, the maxillary from 2^ to 24 in head, 
sometimes not reaching eye, sometimes to below middle of orbit; lower

jaw iucluded; scaly region of nape, beginning very close behind eye. 
Teeth in rather narrow bands, those in onter row in both jaws con- 
siderably enlarged, rather robust. Eyes very small, placed high, their 
range mostly vertical; eye 6 to 7 in head, somewhat greater than the 
narrow, flat, interorbital area. Isthmus moderate, its width 3^ in head; 
gill-openings extending forwards but very little above opercle. 

Head naked; scales on nuchal and antedorsal regions much reduced 
in size ; nuchal i)atch of scales beginning close behind eyes ; scales on 
body all regularly imbricated, roughly ctenoid, those on caudal peduncle 
largest. 

Dorsal spines low, rather slender, the tips slender and slightly ex- 
serted, the longest spine not quite half head; soft dorsal moderate, the 
longest rays 2| in head ; caudal slightly rounded behind, 1 ^ in head ; 
ventrals Ij in head, the basal membrane broad, moderately developed; 
vent midway between base of caudal and front of eye. 

Two large specimens, each about G inches long, and five smaller ones 
were taken in fresh water near San Jose. Some (probably all) of the 
large-mouthed specimens are males, the others females. 

9. Gobius sagittula (Giintlicr ) J. & G. 

3093G. Seven specimens were obtained from San Jose, the largest 4 
inches long. The teeth in the upper jaw are not in a single series, as 
described by Dr. Giinther, but form a narrow band, the outer series 
being much enlarged and separated from the band by a narrow inter- 
space. 

10. Philypnus lateralis Gill. 

30037. Two specimens, the largest 4i inches long, collected at San 
Jos^. This species differs very little from the Atlantic P. dorniitator, 
the fins, formuhe, and general proportions being the same. The adult 
lateralis loses the dark bands along sides, but retains the black spot on 
base of upper pectoral rays; the depth of adult lateralis (4 J in length) 
is much greater than in dormitator, and the scales on cheeks and top of 
head are larger. 

11. Dormitator maculatus (Bloch) J. & G. 

30939. Very numerous specimens of this species, the largest 7 inches 
long, were procured at San Jose. 

12. Culius aequidens Jor. & Gilb. 

30943. Two specimens, one an adult 1^ feet long, were taken in fresh 
water near San Jos6. The adult has the mouth larger (maxillary reach- 
ing well beyond orbit) and eye snmller (contained nearly four times in 
interorbital space) than in the type specimens of this species. 

13. Aphoristia atricauda Jord. & Gilb. 

30942. A single small specimen, li inches long, has numerous small

roundish light spots on the colored side, and the black of the tail ocel- 
lated with white. 

14. Tetrodon testudineus L.

I^IST OF FaSMESCOI.l[>,ECTE» AT PANAMA, BY KEV. MR. R«\V]EI>1j, 
IVO^V PRESERVED SIV THE UNITED STATED IVATIONAI. MUSEUM. 

By DAVID S. JOKBAN asid CfflAMI.ES II. CJII.BERT. 

At some time about the year 1860, a collection of fishes was sent 
from Panama to the Smithsonian Institution, by Eev. Mr. Eowell. The 
following is an enumeration of the specimens belonging to this collec- 
tion, now preserved in the United States National Museum : 

1. JBlurichtliys pinnimaculatus Steiiid. 

31004. One specimen, 20 inches long. 

2. Arius elatturus Jor. & Gilb. 
30995. One specimen. 

3. Arius insculptus J. & G. 

30977. Two specimens, in fair condition. 

4. Hemirhamphus poeyi Giiuther. 

31019. One specimen, answering well to Giiuther's description of this 
species, which has not been hitherto noticed on the Pacific coast of Cen- 
tral America. 

5. Muraena pinta J. & G. 
7328. One specimen. 

6. Rhypticus nigripinnis Gill. 

{lUuaJticus nigripinnis Gill, Proc. Ac, Nat. Sci. Phila. 1861, 53.) 
3700. The original type of the species, 3J inches long, in bad con- 
dition, evidently identical with the adult specimen later described as 
Promicropterus decoratus, and with the young example called Rliypticus 
maculatm. 

7. Centropomus armatus Gill. 
One specimen, 7 inches long. 

8. Pomadasys branicki (Steiud.) J. & G. 
7499. One specimen, 3 inches long. 

9. Diabasis flaviguttatus (Gill.) J. & G. 

31005. Two specimens, 8^ inches in length. 

10. Apogon dovii Giinther, 

C268. Two specimens, in bad condition.

11. Micropogon altipinnis Giinther. 

7010. A young specimen, in bad condition. 

12. Gerres peruvianus C. & V. 
5717. One specimen. 

Two species allied to the present one occur in tlie West Indies, and 
all three have been called Gerres rliomheus by authors. One of these, 
evidently the Gerres rliomheus C. & V., has but two anal spines; the 
other, Gerres rliomheus, or Mojarra rhomhea Poey {= Gerres oUsthostoma 
Goode & Bean Mss.), has the ovate groove for the reception of the pre- 
maxillary processes completely covered with scales. In Gerres peruvi- 
anus, as in most species of Gerres, this region is entirely naked. There 
are also minor differences in the length of the fins. We have never seen 
a specimen with two anal spines on the Pacific coast of tropical America, 
but the two-spined species [rliomheus) is common at Aspinwall. 

13. Citharichthys spilopterus Giintlier. 

3099G. Three specimens, in poor condition.

OIV A COr.r.ECTIOIV of BIRS!^ FROITI the HACIFIVDA "liA PAI.IWIA," 
GUr.F OF NICOYA, COSTA RICA. 

By C. C. CUTTING. 

[With critical notes by R. Eidgway.*] 

Costa Rica, the southernmost of the Central American States, lies 
between the eighth and eleveuth degrees north latitude, quite a consid- 
erable portion being actually south of Panama, owing to the peculiar 
curve of the continent between Costa Rica and Sonth America proper. 

Like all the Central American States, Costa Rica is characterized by 
comparatively low coast regions, with a rugged interior composed of 
mountains which reach an altitude of nearly 11,000 feet, as is the case 
with the volcanoes of "Irazu" and "Turrialba," and elevated valleys 
sometimes of considerable extent, as the valleys of San Jose and Car- 
tago. 

These physical characteristics render the region a most fertile one for 
the naturalist, who finds in this favored field vegetable and animal 
life varying with the altitude of his collecting ground, and embracing 
both tropical and temperate forms. 

On the 13th of February, 1882, I landed in Punta Arenas, the only 
important point on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Although my in- 
structions were to direct my efforts principally to the region of the

Gulf of Nicoya, I found it necessary to go to San Jos^, the capital, to 
present certain letters of introduction and confer with Seiior Don Jose 
Zeledon, of that city, as to the best disposition of the short time at my 
disposal. This gentleman strongly advised me to spend some time col- 
lecting in the interior, more especially in the region of the volcano 
'' Irazu," and I accordingly decided to spend a fortnight there; also, a 
few days in San Jose, after which I returned to the coast and sf>ent a 
mouth in collecting in the region of the Gulf of Nicoya. These three 
fields of operation, embracing as they did the three distinctive avi-faunte 
of low, middle, and high altitudes, seemed to me to be most likely to 
afibrd a representative collection of Costa Rican birds. 

The collections from the interior having not yet been received, it be- 
came necessary to defer lists of the species therein included, but which, 
it is hoped, may be presented within a reasonable time. 

The Gulf of Nicoya extends from northwest to southeast, and is 60 
or 80 miles long, dotted with numerous conical islands (the largest be- 
ing San Lucas, a convict island), and encircled by low hills closely 
covered with tropical vegetation. 

La Palma, the hacienda of Don Eamon Espinach, was my home dur- 
iug my stay in that region, and it is to the courtesy of its kind pro- 
prietor that I owe whatever success has attended my visit there. Noth- 
ing could be more generous than his conduct toward me, an utter 
stranger, and it is with the greatest pleasure that 1 embrace this op- 
portunity to express my sincere thanks, not only for a pleasant home 
for more than a month, but also for much practical assistance in the 
way of furnishing horses and men and all other facilities to aid my ex- 
plorations and increase my collections. La Palma is situated about 10 
miles northwest of Colorado, a little hamlet on the northern coast of 
the gulf. 

The region is an exceedingly low one, and in the rainy season be- 
comes a vast swamp, unhealthy and infested with numerous insects. 
My visit was at the end of the dry season, at which time the earth 
was exceedingly dry and hard, and checkered with deep cracks caused 
by the intense heat of the tropical sun. 

Notwithstanding the fierce heat, the forests were green and the flowers 
were blooming luxuriantly, while birds and other animals were extremely 
abundant. The vegetation is, of course, entirely tropical in its nature. 
Among the fruit trees the palm, mango, plantain, bauaua, orange, and 
"maraiion" are worthj^ of mention. This latter fruit I do not remember 
to have seen elsewhere. The fruit resembles a red pepper with a bean- 
shaped seed hanging from its lower end. The taste is slightly acid and 
very pleasant. 

The rubber, red-wood, and mahogany trees are also abundant, 
although a market for them has not been opened in that region. The 
forests are composed of other strictly tropical trees, bound together and 
interlaced with a network of vines of every description and covered

with orchids and parasitic cacti. The ground beneath is freer from 
obstruction in the way of undergrowth tlian might be expected, 
although numerous species of cacti and other thorn-bearing i)lauts 
are sometimes exceedingly annoying to the collector. 

The mammalian fauna is rich and varied. Three species of monkeys 
were noticed. The " Howling Monkey " [Mycetes palUatus) is most i^rom- 
inent to the ear, if not to the eye. Its cry is the most diabolical, in the 
estimation of the writer, of all sounds issuing from animate beings. 
The "Eed Monkey" {Sapajou melanochir) in quite numerous, and is the 
largest in size of Costa Eican Quadrumana. One little domestic scene 
in connection with this monkey impressed the writer so forcibly that he 
cannot refrain from describing it. While hunting along a lagoon one 
day, I suddenly came under a tree in which a troop of these monkeys 
w^ere disporting themselves. A female, with her "baby " clinging to 
her back, happened to be nearest me at the end of an overhanging 
branch. Upon seeing the strange-looking animal below, with true 
maternal solicitude for her offspring, she hastened to bear it out of 
danger. As she started for the main trunk of the tree, a male started 
from the trunk to go out and have a closer look at the intruder. They 
met about the middle of the branch, when she commenced to chatter 
and look down at me as if to implore his protection, upon which he put 
his arms around her and embraced her. x\fter standing in that position 
for several seconds, they parted, each proceeding on its way. After such 
a scene of almost human affection it is needless to say that the writer 
could not find the heart to shoot one of the monkeys. 

The most abundant by far is the White-faced Monkey {Cehus hypo- 
leucus), which is black with the exception of the shoulders and sides of 
the face, which are covered with rather long white hair, thus giving the 
appearance of little bald-headed black men. They were often quite an- 
noying from their habit of throwing sticks, nuts, etc., at the traveler 
passing below them. They soon discovered the place where I took my 
morning bath, and were so annoying in this particular that I appreciated 
as nexev before the pathetic story of the " Boys and the Frogs," and had 
to shoot one of them in pure self-defense. But I felt like a murderer 
for it. 

The Felidic are well represented in this region. The Jaguar {Felis 
onca) is quite common, but apparently of a smaller race than in South 
America. It is not considered dangerous by the natives. Felis concolor, 
the " Leon" of that country, is rather rare and much feared by the in- 
habitants. Several other animals of this family were seen, especially 
one entirely black (probably a melanism of the Jaguarundi) which I do 
not remember with sufficient distinctness to venture to identify. 

A beautiful little species of Deer ( Cervus m exicanvs) is abundant, not at 
all timid, and easily approached. Its flesh is, of course, excellent food. 

The Peccary {Bicotyles torquatus) is abundant, though usually seen 
in small droves of not more than eight or ten. I never heard of their 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 385 

attacking man, as they are said to do. The natives sever the scent- 
pouch from the animal as soon as possible after death. Otherwise it is 
extremely disagreeable both to the taste and smell. 

The " Watousa" {Dasyprocia cristata) is also cpiite common, though 
very shy and mostly coatined to the thick forests. Its flesh is, in the 
oi)inion of the writer, the most delicious meat he ever had the pleasure 
of eating. 

The Tapir {Elasmognathus hairdi) is somewhat rare, and seldom seen, 
probably on account of its nocturnal habits. 

The Coatimundi {Nasua narica) is abundant, and though eaten by 
the Indians is not considered eatable by the Spaniards. It somewhat 
resembles the Eaccoon {Procyon lotor) but is diurnal, as a rule, and is 
Irecpiently found in quite extensive troops of twenty or more. 

Smaller mammals are numerous, but not having secured specimens, 
the writer will not venture to identify them. 

Alligators are extremely abundant and constitute a source of con- 
stant annoyance, and sometimes of danger, to the collector while hunt- 
ing along the rivers and lagoons of that region. 

The avi-fauna, although strictly tropical, is not so varied as on the 
eastern coast. 

Perhaps the most characteristic birds of the region are the Parrots 
{Psittacl). They are so numerous as to constitute a real source of an- 
noyance to the collector. They are always noisy and apparently always 
quarreling. Their harsh, discordant cries make such a din that the 
faint twittering of the smaller birds is entirely drowned, and many 
rarities are doubtless unobserved by the naturalist who vainly attempts 
to trace their modest song among the clatter of their gaudy neighbors. 

The Falconidcc are exceedingly numerous and easy to approach. It 
is by no means unlikely that novelties in this family will yet be re- 
ported from the Gulf of Nicoya. 

The prevalence of the "zygodactyle" foot is a very marked feature of 
the birds of this region. 

In concluding my remarks upon this region it may be well to men- 
tion some of the difficulties to be met by the naturalist, together with a 
few i^ractical hints as to how they are best surmounted. 

The climate is much more bearable than might be supposed. The 
heat is never so intense as that which we frequently experience in the 
United States. Indeed I never found it so oppressive as it is here in 
Washington as I write. The nights are always comfortably cool and 
one always finds use for his blanket before morning. 

By far the most favorable time for collecting is during the dry sea- 
son (October to May). The seasons (the wet and dry) are very distinctly 
defined, so that the collector may know what kind of weather to expect. 

Ants are very troublesome to the collector. They attack the bills of 
his specimens and frequently ruin a rare bird in a very few minutes. 
But there is a sure remedy for this pest in the oil of bitter almonds, 
Proc. Nat. Mus. No. 82 25 Sept. 5, 1883. 



386 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

which, if rubbed on the bills of specimens, the ants will religiously leave 
the birds alone. This method was suggested to me by Don Jose Zele- 
don, of San Jose, and proved to be all that could be desired. 

But there is another and far more terrible pest which attacks not the 
specimens, but the naturalist himself. I refer to a little insect known 
in those regions as the "Garrapata," which is a very minute species of 
Tick. During the dry season it is impossible to avoid being actually 
covered with these diminutive tormentors. They are so numerous that 
it is impossible to avoid them, and their bite is so aggravating that a 
man is actually panic-stricken when he finds himself literally alive with 
them. These insects constituted the most serious difficulty I met in 
Costa Eica. My body became entirely covered with their bites. "The 
itching caused was frightful, and, although I could control myself dur- 
ing the day, I would wake up at night and find myself literally tearing 
my flesh in frantic though unconscious efforts to relieve the itching. 
Working daily with arsenic, this poison unavoidably found its way into 
the system through the bites of the "Garrapatas," and I was thus 
severely j^oisoned and my person co\ered with festering sores, making 
it dangerous to pursue my work further at that time. Any preventive 
for this evil would be a boon to tropical explorers. I regret to say that 
I know of none that is unobjectionable as well as effective. Moisten- 
ing the lower part of the pantaloons and sleeves of the coat with a 
decoction of tobacco juice is a partial success, and so is anointing the 
entire body with kerosene. The best way to rid one's self of these pests 
after they have established themselves on the person is to follow the 
example of the natives, who first procure a piece of the black wax or 
^' j(era," which is abuiidant, and, after removing all their clothing, pro- 
ceed to strike themselves with the wax. This they do systematically 
until every portion of the body has been struck. The wax, by adhe- 
sion, removes every '' Garrapata" that it strikes. This simple and effect- 
ive method of getting rid of these insects is the universal practice 
throughout the country. 

The slow and inadequate means of transportation, especially in the 
less-settled portions of the country, is apt to cause long and annoying 
delays. When possible it is advisable for the collector to keep with 
him as many of his effects as he expects to need for a fortnight at least, 
including a large supply oUpatie^ice. 

1. Merula grayi (Bonap.). 

Common. Habits and note similar to the common Robin of the United 
States, M. migratorius. Rather solitary and silent during the time I 
collected in that region, but this is probably due to the fact that it was 
the breeding season. Iris brown.

2. Polioptila bilineata (Bonap.). 

[Note by R. R. — The black-capped PoUoptilcc of Central and South 
America are involved at present in so much confusion that the following 
remarks, based upon specimens in the collection of the United States 
National Museum, may not be out of place. The latest information 
which we have upon the subject is that contained in Salvin and God- 
man's Biologia Centrali Americana (Aves, vol. i, pp. 50-55), and this 
should be carefully consulted in the present connection. The authors 
of the work quoted recognize in Central America three species of the 
genus, besides P. cwrnlea, as follows: 

(1.) P. NiGRiOEPS Baird. Rab. — Southwestern Mexico (Mazatlau, 
Tepic, and States of Oaxaca and Tehuantepec) ; also, Colombia and 
Yenezuela, but not recorded from any ijart of Central America proper, 
except San Salvador (La Union). 

(2.) P. BILINEATA (Bouap.). Hah. — Guatemala to Colombia and 
western Ecuador. 

(3.) P. ALBiLORis Scl. & Salv. Rab. — Southwestern Mexico (Sta. 
Efigenia and Tehuantepec City), Guatemala, and Nicaragua. 

In their treatmeut of these three species, Messrs. Sai^vin and God- 
man make some very interesting generalizations, based ui)on certain 
anomalies in their geographical distribution, but which appear to be 
somewhat negatived by the evidence afforded by additional specimens. 
Disclaiming, however, any intention of criticising the hypotheses oifered 
by the authors of the great work in question, the following remarks are 
presented as perhaps throwing some additional light upon this more or 
less complicated subject. 

Of the true P. nigriccps we possess specimens only from southwestern 
Mexico (Mazatlau and Tepic to Tehuantepec and Oaxaca). The seven 
examples before me may each be very readily distinguished from all 
black-lored specimens of the genus from more southern localities in the 
collection hy the indistinct gray edgings to the tertials, all of the more 
southern black-capped forms, with the single exception of P. bilineata. 
having the tertials broadly and very distinctly edged with pure white. 
P. bilineata, however, may, in every plumage, be easily distinguished 
by the white lores and superciliaries. 

The only other black-lored form of which the Museum possesses adult 
males is P. leucogastra. Of this, there are two adult males and two 
young males from Bahia, and a female from Venezuela. The young 
male has the crown plumbeous (darker than the back), the feathers 
darker in the center, and with a distinct postocular patch of glossy 
black. Tlie Museum also possesses an adult male from Bogota, one 
from the Pacific coast of Central America (No. 30555, Capt. J. M. Dow), 
and another from Grenada, Nicaragua (No. 32556), which I cannot dis- 
tinguish in any way from the Brazilian birds, or true P. leucogastra, 
The broad and conspicuous white edgings to the tertials at once sepa- 
rate them from P. nigriceps. 



388 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Of P. albilora there are in the collection two adnlt males and two 
femaleSy as follows: Xo. 34101, S , Eealejo (Pacific coast of Nicaragua), 
February, and 30551, 2 , same locality, July 10; No. 59584, S , Tehuan- 
tepec City, November 11, and 57470, 5 , Sta. Eflgeuia, Teliuantepec, 
December 25. Each of these specimens may be at once distinguished 
from any examples of P. hilineaUi by the broad and distinct white edg- 
ing to the tertials; and if not a distinct species, must be a connecting 
link (possibly a hybrid) between P. Uucogastra and P. hiUneata, having 
the conspicuously white-edged tertials of the former and the white lores 
of the latter. That it is probably distinct from both these forms is 
suggested by the tact that its habitat is mostly to the northward of the 
district inhabited by P. bilineata and P. leucogastra together, although 
to the southward (i. e., in Guatemala and Nicaragua) the three are 
found in the same localities. 

P. Mlineafa is represented by a considerable series, embracing speci- 
mens from Venezuela, Panama, Yeragua, Costa Eica, Nicaragua (Grey- 
town), and Guatemala. The species is well defined, an adult male each 
from the first and last localities mentioned above beiug undistiuguish- 
able, except that one is in somewhat worn, the other in fresh and soft, 
plumage. An adult female from Venezuela is likewise undistingnish- 
able from northern specimens. 

Granting that P. buffoni has always the lateral tail-feather white ex- 
cept at the extreme concealed base, it may thus be distinguished Irom 
P. leucogastra., but of this species or race I have been able to examine 
but a single specimen, an adult female from Demerara (No. 55101, U. 
S. Nat. Mus.). This seems very distinct from the female of all the forms 
discussed above. The npper parts are a decidedly paler and bluer gray, 
almost exactly as in P. ca^rulea; the lateral pair of rectrices have the 
exposed portion entirely white, only the extreme concealed base being 
black; the greater wing-coverts are ranch paler gray than the back, 
and pass into grayish white at the tip; this white and also that on 
the outer webs of the tertials shows in very abrupt and striking con- 
trast to the deep black of the primaries, primary coverts, and alulae. 
The lores of this specimen are light grayish, aud there is a distinct 
supraocular spot of white. 

Upon the whole, it appears, from the material examined, that the 
following species, or at least well-nmrked races, of black-capped Foliop- 
tilw, may be recognized as be longing to Central and South America: 
A; Pileum and lores wholly black in fully adult males. 

a. Lateral tail-feather wholly white for exposed portion. 

1. P. BUFFONI. Tertials broadly edged with pure white. (Cay- 

enne.) 

b. Lateral tail-feather black at base, this usnally showing consid- 

erably beyond the coverts. 

2. P. LEUCOGASTRA. Tertials broadly edged with pure white. 

(Bahia, Bogota, Venezuela, Colombia, Nicaragua.) 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSUEM. 389 

3. P. NiGRiCEPS. Tertials narrowly edged with dull gray. 

(Mazatlau, Tepic, Tapaua, Tehuantepec, Quiotepec, Oax- 
aca.) 
B. Pileum black, but lores white, in fully adult males. 

4. P. ALBiLORis. Lores and eyelids white, but this scarcely 

passing beyond the eye; tertials broadly edged with pure 
white. (Realejo, Nicaragua; Sta. Eflgenia, Tehuantepec.) 

5. P. Bi^iNEATA. Lores, eyelids, and superciliary stripe white; 

tertials narrowly edged with gray. (Venezuela, Panama, 
Veragua, Costa Rica, Is<icaragua, Guatemala.) 

Additional note.— Since the above was written, Mr, Geo. N. Law- 
rence has kindly forwarded for inspection his entire series of black- 
capped PoUopUlcG from Middle and South America, embracing the lol- 
lowing specimens: (1) P. buffoni: 1 9 from Guiana, agreeing with that 
described above. (2) P. leucogastra: 1 $ ad. from Bahia, 1 do. from 
Bogota, and 1 S juv. from Venezuela, the latter being the type of P. 
plumbeiceps Lawr. (3) P. nigriceps : 1 $ ad. from Sta. Eflgenia, Tehuantepec. 
(4) P. albiloris: 1 S ad. fiom Sta. Eflgenia, Tehuantepec, 1 ? ad. from 
Tapana, Tehuantepec, and 1 do. from Guatemala. (5) P. UUneata : 2 $ ad. 
and 1 $ ad., Panama, including the types of P. superciUaris Lawr., and 
1 S ad., said to be from Guatemala (but this on authority of a dealer 
only). This series so fully bears out the indications aftorded by the 
the National Museum specimens that more extended remarks are un- 
necessary. — R. R.] 

Habits similar to our Mniotiltidcv. Seems to prefer the open glades in 
the forests rather than the denser parts. Quite common near La Palma, 
although ouly one specimen was secured. 

No. 248. 5 ad. April 25, 1882. 

3. Campylorhynchus capistratus (Less.). 

[Note. — Five Costa Rican specimens of this species differ appreci- 
ably from two others from Guatemala and Honduras in much more dis- 
tinctly streaked rump (even the feathers of the back being appreciably 
spotted with black beueath the surface), in having the light wing-bars 
much paler, in larger bill, and in some other characters. Without more 
specimens, however, from both regions, showing the differences 
observed to be constant, I hesitate to separate them as races. A single 
specimen of C. rufinucha Lafr. (which some authorities refer to C. capis- 
tratus) from Mirador (No. 30869, C. Sartorius), differs from all the above- 
mentioned specimens in having the whole back very conspicuously 
streaked, the abdomen buff" instead of white, the crissum barred with 
black, and the flanks, sides, and breast minutely but sparsely dotted 
with the same. It seems to be quite distinct, but, cf. Salvin & God- 
man, Biologia Americana Ceutrali, Aves, i. pp. 64, 65. — R. R.]

low, dense shrubbery than most of its kind, it often nests at a consid- 
erable distance from the ground. It is fearless, almost impudent, in its 
manner, and somewhat inclined to play the bully, in a small way, and 
seems to take particular delight in tormenting the " Zopilotilla " {Cro- 
tophaga sulcirostris) when it approaches too closely the home of the 
former. This Wren seems to be particularly fond of solitary trees along 
the edge of the forest, where he can always be seen hunting his food 
much in the same manner as do the Titmice of the north. Their num- 
ber is so great that the woods continually resound with their lively 
song, and the naturalist has no trouble in making their acquaintance 
and securing a full series of skins. Iris brown.

4. Thryophilus rufalbus (Lafr). 

On several occasions, while hunting in the dense forests near La 
Palmn, I have been suddenly arrested by the enchanting song of this 
bird. Breaking suddenly upon the ear from the cool dei)ths of the 
woods, it seemed to me to be the most exquisite melody I had ever 
heard. This song consists of three notes, the first low and sweet, the 
second about four notes above the first, and most exquisitely trilled and 
prolonged, the third high and clear. Sometimes this Wren varies the 
order of its song, sounding the high note first and the low one last. It 
also varies the pitch of each note about a semitone, thus producing a 
remarkably sweet minor strain. 

The bird seems to be rather shy and retiring in disposition, and is 
usually seen in the deep .shades and secluded nooks of the forest. Irs 
song is usually stopped at the approach of a stranger, and the bird flits 
silently away and remains quiet until the danger is passed, thus making 
it a rather difficult species to secure. 

One specimen obtained.

wing measuring only 3.70-4,05, and the tail 3,85-4.05, instead of 4,30- 
4.55 and 4.20-4.65, respectively. I am unable, however, to appreciate 
any tangible differences in coloration. Should the difference in size

prove constant, the Costa Eican bird might form a local race, for which 
the name given above would be exceedingly appropriate. — R. E.] 

A specimen of this beautiful Oriole was kept in a cage at La Palma, 
and as it hung near the place where I daily prepared my bird-skins, 1 
had an excellent opportunity to observe its notes, and, in part, its 
habits. 

He was the most accomplished vocalist I ever heard, had perfect 
command of every note in the scale, and apparently took great delight 
in his accomplishment. 

Thinking him to be a promising subject, I undertook to instruct him 
in the art of whistling, but he scorned my services and went off into 
trills and harmonies of his own composition which put to shame the 
sample I had given in the shape of classic "Yankee Doodle." I 
did succeed in teaching him to run the scale perfectly, an exercise in 
which he reached great perfection, and gained the admiration of his 
hearers. He would whistle by the hour, not in a monotonous repetition 
of the same strain, but constantly varying his music from loud and 
lively to soft and sweet, reminding me of a flute-player running over 
bits of harmony from memory. He was an expert fly-catcher, though 
all sorts of food seemed to suit his taste. His greatest delight seemed 
to be in sitting on my finger and being "teetered" up and down. I 
afterward secured two specimens, which 1 shot in a wild state. Iris 
yellow.

19. Ocyalus -wagleri (Gray & Mitch.). 

A remarkable colony of these curious birds was observed on the road 
from San Jose to Punta Arenas. A very large dead tree standing in 
the road had been taken possession of, and from every limb their purse- 
like nests were suspended. There must have been over two hundred 
of these curious structures, and their occupants were swarming around 
them making a great clatter. A remarkable fact was noticed upon this 
occasion and greatly excited the curiosity both of the Spanish gentle- 
men of the party and myself. These birds had the novel habit of get- 
ting inside their nests and shaking them violently so as to produce a 
loud rattling noise. This we saw them do repeatedly, but could arrive 
at no satisfactory conclusion as to the object of so strange a perform- 
ance. 

20. Calocitta formosa (Swains.). 

This fine Jay is not common, so far as my experience goes. Like all 
the rest of its kind it seems to like to make itself conspicuous, and is 
usually seen in the top of a tree calling loudly in a harsh voice. Its 
recurved crest is a prominent characteristic. It is said by the natives 
to talk like a parrot {^'■habla como loro"), but I never had an oppor-

inner webs of all the rectrices (except the intermediae) being either 
wholly rufous or else with a very narrow stripe of dusky next to the 
shaft of the outer feather. Adult: Above brownish gray (exactly as in 
M. cinerascens), occasionally tinged with olive, thepileum much browner 
and with darker shaft-streaks ; wings and middle pair of rectrices dusky 
brownish, the latter uniform ; last row of lesser coverts, middle, and 
greater coverts, distinctly tipped with light brownish gray; tertialtj 
edged exteriorly with grayish white (tinged with sulphur-yellow in fresh 
plumage), the primaries edged with light rufous toward the base. Outer 
webs of rectrices dusky brownish (like both webs of the intermedice), 
the outer pair with the exterior edge much paler (nearly white in some 
specimens) ; inner webs of all the rectrices excepting the middle pair 
clear rufous, including the extreme tip, and usually extending quite to the

row streak of dusky. Chin, throat, and jugulum very pale ash-grav 
(exactly the same shade as in 31. mexicanus and M. cinerascens), the remain- 
ing lower parts sulphur-yellow (same as in mexicanus but deeper than 
in cinerascens). Bill black, the mandible sometimes brownish, paler at 
base ; iris brown ; legs and feet deep black. Wing 3.45-3.80, tail 3.20-

Hah. — Southwestern Mexico (Tehuantepec) to Costa Eica (Pacific 
side). 

The above diagnosis is drawn up from six specimens of a MyiarchuSj 
which cannot be referred to either 3L mexicanus or M. cinerascens, 
though evidently very closely related to both of them. All the specimens 
hitherto seen are from the Pacific coastof Central America (Costa Rica to 
Tehauntepec, southwestern Mexico), a region where either il/. ?/i^.ricaims 
or M. cinerascens, or both, also occurs. It doubtless, however, represents 
the resident form specially characteristic of the district named, the other 
two occuring there as stragglers from other districts. In all respects, 
except the iiattern of the tail-feathers, this form agrees to the minutest 
degree with the two species named above, except that in M. cinerascens 
the abdomen is a slightly paler sulphur-yellow. The most conspicuous 
specific character distinguishing M. cinerascens consists, however, in the 
terminal dusky space on the inner webs of the rectrices, of which there 
is no trace in 31. mittingi. 31. mexicanus (in all its forms) has, on the 
other hand, a broad and very distinct stripe of dusky next the shaft on 
the inner webs of the rectrices, while in 31. nuttingi there is never more 
than a mere indication of this stripe. Thus it may be seen that the 
present form, whether species or race, cannot be referred to either of 
the species named, and that it must, therefore, be considered quite as 
distinct from them both as they are from one another. — R. R.]

* The uest of this bird is a most remarkable structure, well worthy of descriptiou. 
It is a pendulous inverted pouch, suspended from a single twig, composed almost en- 
tirely of slender black filaments resembling horse-hairs (probably a vegetable fiber 
related to, if not identical with, the " Spanish Moss," or Tillandsia of the Southern 
United States), and so loosely built as to be easily seen through when held up to the 
light. The entrance is at the extreme lower end, the nest proj^er being a sort of 
pocket on one side, about 2 inches above the entrance. The total length of the entire 
structure is 10 inches, the greatest width 4 inches, the lower **neck," or wall of the 
entrance, being about 2^ inches in diameter. — R. R.

27. Muscivora mexicana Scl. 

This exquisitely ornamented Flycatclier is abundant in' the vicinity 
of La Palma, especially along the water courses. Indeed, I never saw 
it away from the water. It builds its nest on a branch overhanging. 
a stream, seems to be quite contented to remain in the immediate vicin- 
ity of its home, and is quiet and modest in manner. 

Never having seen this bird before, my surprise and admiration were 
unbounded when I held one in my hand for the first time, and saw its 
wonderfully brilliant fan-shaped crest. The bird was only \Y0unded, 
and the crest was fully spread, while the head was slowly moved from 
side to side, which gave it the appearance of a bright flower nodding in 
the wind. While admiring this new wonder, I heard a twitter of dis- 
tress immediately above me and, looking up, was delighted to see the 
female perched on a twig not more than ten feet above me, v/ith her crest 
erected and spread, and making the same waving motion of the head. 
Is it not possible that this bird is provided with its remarkable crest for 
the purpose of attracting its insect prey, and that the slow and regular 
waving motion is calculated to still further deceive by a simulation of a 
flower nodding in the breeze ? 

It is a singular fact that while this bird is quite common in that region, 
the natives had never discovered its peculiar ornamentation before I 
showed it to them.

[Note. — The single specimen, an adult female, obtained by Mr. Nut-

and Bahia, having, like them, the pileum slate-colored, the other upper 
parts a clear light rufous, and the lower parts ochraceous-white medi- 
ally. In fact, I do not see how it can be distinguished by color alone. 
Geographical considerations, however, preclude the probability of its 
being 11. atricapillus ; and since H. honiochrous, which is known to occur 
from Ecuador to Panama, may very likely extend it ^ range still furtber 
along the coast to the Nicoya district, I with some doubt refer the 
specimen in question to the latter species, which is not represented in

Exceedingly abundant in the vicinity of La Palma, where five or six

ing ''bird of the night." 

Frequently in passing through the thick brush I have flushed this 
bird. It would flit silently ahead a short distance, and then apparently 
alight on the ground ; but upon reaching the spot I would find that, 
like the "Irishman's flea," it was not there. Upon closer observation 
I found that the bird did not really alight when it appeared to, but 
Avouid suddenly descend to the ground, over which it would hover for 
an instant as if in the act of alighting, and then glide silently on close 
to the ground for some little distance, and finally settle down in the 
dead leaves near a tree-trunk or bush.

spatulate tail-feathers are apt to attract attention. It seems to be soli-

These graceful birds are also common throughout Costa Eica. Like 
the other true Cuckoos, it is a silent and solitary bird for the most part, 
although wlien disturbed it utters a loud, harsh note at regular intervals 
as it looks down upon the intruder and flirts its beautiful tail with angry 
jerks. Iris red.

53. Pteroglossus torqiiatus (Gm.). 

This is the only species of Toucan that I saw on the Pacific coast, 
although another species was described to me. It seems to prefer the 
open forest. Its uncouth bill would convey the idea that it is a clumsy 
bird, but on the contrary it is rather graceful and handles its immense 
beak with ease. The bill is very light, being cellular in its internal 
structure. I know from experience that it is capable of giving quite a 
severe bite, a fact to which a scar on my finger still testifies. I never 
heard its note although T observed several. Iris yellow, bill yellow, 
red, and black. 

One specimen.

54. Ara macao (Liun.)- 

Abundant. The size, gaudy colors, and loud voice of this bird make it, 
perhaps, the most noticeable one of the region. It feeds almost exclu- 
sively upon fruits and nuts, is strictly monogamous and, although mat- 
rimonial jars are of daily and hourly occurrence, is very aftectionate. 
The bill is so enormous and strong and the bite so dangerous that the 
collector is sometimes at a loss as to the best manner of killiug this bird 
when wounded. I solved the diiiiculty very quickly and satisfactorily 
by breaking its neck with a vigorous blow with the back of a " machete," 
the long heavy knife universally carried by the natives and absolutely 
indispensable to the collector. This is a sure and effective means of 
killing the Macaw. These birds generally sit in pairs close to each 
other, and both can usually be killed with one shot. Iris very j)ale 
yellow. Bare parts of the head i^iukish white.

Exceedingly abundant. The common Parakeet of the region. It is 
found in flocks varying from half a dozen to one hundred or more. It 
is a remarkably tough little bird and hard to kill. When struck by the 
shot it does not fly like most birds, but grasps the limb tightly with its 
strong feet and hangs on until quite dead. It seems to prefer solitary 
trees standing in open fields, although it is found in almost all situa- 
tions except on the ground. Iris brown. Cere white.

Abundant. Its harsh cry is always heard throughout that region 
from sunrise to sunset. As night comes on they begin to gather into 
some particuhir tree, coming always in pairs and making a great deal 
of noise in settling for the night. It seems difficult for them to suit 
tliemselves as to their quarters for the night, and they try a number of 
situations, discussing each with many querulous expressions of discon-

often seen them in moonlight nights remain quietly asleep for several 
hours, and then as if by a common impulse leave the tree with a loud 
whirring of wings, but otherwise in utter silence, to seek another tree.

one, on account of its being already on record, in Hist. N. Am. Birds, vol. iii, 1874,

This bird I fouud to be abundant in the vicinity of the "Zapotal," a 
large fresh-wat^r lagoon. It is exceedingly fearless, so far as man is 
coucerned, although this may be due to the fact that it has not yet 
learned to fear him.

[ Juv. (Ko. 87485, La Palma, Costa Eica, April 21, 1883 ; C. C. Nut-

ers, these longest on the occiput, where they form somewhat of a bushy 
crest; feathered portion of lower neck light brownish gray; rump, 
upper tail-coverts, and tail white; rest of upper part soft brownish 
gray, irregularly mixed with pure white feathers (of the adult livery !), 
tliese most numerous among the lesser wing-coverts and anterior scap- 
ulars ; primaries white, tinged with gray at ends. Lower parts entirely 
white. Bill, all the naked portion of head and neck (except lower por- 
tion of the latter), legs, and feet black ; " collar round lower neck bright 
scarlet; iris brown." Wing 24.50, tail 9.50, culmen 9.75, tarsus 11.25, 
middle toe 4.50.— R. E.] 

Common. The natives have a name for this Stork which is extremely 
well chosen. It is '■'■ Galan sin ventura,''^ or, literally, "Shabby Gen- 
teel." The fitness of this name can be appreciated only by one who has 
seen him in his native lagoon. The contrast between the gay red collar, 
stately bearing, and dignified movements and the general shabbiness of 
his dirty white coat and scaly legs is extremely ridiculous, and causes a 
realization of the appropriateness of its name. 

The chief occupation of this bird is fishing, of course, although frogs 
and reptiles are by no means slighted.

Head 2| to 2f in leugtb, without caudal ; depth 2f to 21. D. XIII, 
12; A. Ill, 6. Scales 40 (tubes iu lateral line), the number of cross 
series about 50 (counted below lateral line). 

Body moderately robust, little compressed, not specially elongate. 
Mouth moderate, oblique, the nuxxillary extending backward about to 
iwsterior margin of pupil, its length almost half head. Jaws about 
equal, the lower with a strong symphyseal knob, fitting into a broad 
notch in the upper. Premaxillary iu front on level of lower margin of 
eye. Preorbital narrow, not more than half width of maxillaiy, armed 
with two retrorse spines. Eye large, 4 iu head, somewhat longer than 
snout. Nasal spines strong. 

Cranial ridges well developed, sharp, but not high, in form interme- 
diate between those of pinniger and constcUatus ; as strong as in coti- 
sfellatus, but lower. Preocular, supraocular, [)ostocular, tympanic, and 
occipital spines present. Preocular spine very conspicuous ; supraocu- 
lar ridge low, its spine smaller than postocular or tympanic. Occii)ital 
ridge about as long as supraocular, about two-thirds eye. Interorbital 
space much broader than in consteUatiis, its width two-thirds eye; it is 
concave, with two rather strong ridges diverging backward ; between 
these posteriorly are two smaller ridges. Suprascapula with two spines. 
Space between occipital ridges slightly concave. Preopercular spines 
strong, all of them acute, the second longest and rather slender. 
Opercular spines well developed. Gill rakers rather long and slender, 
the longest 24- in eye ; about 24 of them on lower limb of arch. 

Dorsal fin deeply notched ; neither the spines nor the soft rays very 
high. Longest dorsal spine 2} to 2 J in head ; longest soft ray scarcely 
shorter. Soft dorsal longer than high. Caudal very slightly emargi- 
nate, the middle rays 21 in head. Pectoral 3f^ in body, not reaching 
vent. Ventrals about half head. 

Scales rough, the accessory scales numerous; small scales along 
bases of fins. Both jaws with some small smoothish scales, those on 
mandible mostly towards its base. 

Ground color light orange, quite faint or obsolete on parts of the body. 
Upper parts overlaid with a dusky hue, formed largely of dark points 
so numerous as to give a dusty appearance. The dark color on the sides 
forms irregular vermiculations, the center of each scale being pale 
orange, the edge dusky. Some areas along the back, between the pale 
blotches, are quite blackish. Jaws and inside of mouth light orange,

more or less soiled. Two or three dark shades from eye across cheek. 
A dnsky shade along maxillary. Opercle dusky, its flap with a spot 
of pale pink or orange. Each side of back above the lateral line with 
5 or roundish pale blotches, of a light pink color, more or less tinged 
with orange. One of these just below base of fourth dorsal spine; two 
under base of eighth dorsal spine, the uppermost faint, the lower large, 
near the lateral line, and somewhat further back than the upper one. 
A large blotch under the last dorsal spine ; a large one under last rays 
of soft dorsal, with sometimes a smaller one in front of it. These spots 
are rather less sharply defined and more yellowish than in constellatus, 
rosaceus, &c. They correspond in position nearly to those found in the 
latter species. Fins all pale orange, more or less shaded with blackish. 
Peritoneum black. In one specimen the orange shade is less intense 
than in the other. 

Two specimens (31140, 31141), 10 and 11 inches in length, were taken 
by Andrea Larco at Santa Eosa Island, near Santa Barbara, and were 
forwarded by hiin to the National Museum. 

The sj)ecies is well distinguished from all its luimerous congeners on 
our Pacific coast. It probably most nearly approaches S. constellatus, 
among the species thus far known. 

2. Citharichthys stigmaeus, sp. uov. (31099.) 

Body moderately deep, the two profiles regularly and equally arched ; 
the snout short, gibbous, projecting a little beyond the outline; caudal 
peduncle very short, not high, its length (from end of last vertebra to 
vertical from last anal ray) about two-fifths its height, which is three- 
sevenths length of head ; caudal fin appearing sessile. Mouth moderate, 
very oblique, the maxillary reaching slightly beyond front of pupil, 2'^ 
in head; teeth in a single series, subequal in the two jaws, rather long, 
very slender and numerous, decreasing towards angle of mouth ; about 
40 teeth in the upper jaw, and 30 in the lower, on blind side. Eyes large, 
close together, separated by a narrow, sharp, scaleless ridge ; the upper 
eye largest, slightly behind the lower, with considerable vertical range; 
diameter of upper eye, o^ in head. Snout andloAver jaw scaleless ; end 
of maxillary and rest of head scaled. Gill-rakers moderate, not strong, 
about 9 on anterior limb. 

Dorsal fin beginning on the vertical from front of upper eye, the first 
three rays being somewhat turned to blind side ; the fin low, highest 
at beginning of its posterior third, the longest ray nearly half length of 
head. Anal spine present, very small. Caudal rounded, about equaling 
length of head. Pectoral of colored side If in head, of blind side 2^. 

Scales moderate, those forming the lateral line persistent, the others 
deciduous ; those on colored side with ciliated margins, on blind side

The following budget of descriptions is presented as the result of a 
partial examination of the large collections of fishes from the Southern 
Atlantic States in the United States National Museum, some of which 
have been on hand for twenty years or more. 

1. Tetrodon nephelus, n. sp. 

The types are numbered 31427, 31428, and 2G570. The first two were 
taken at Indian Eiver, Florida, by Mr. E. E. Earll; the last at Pensacola, 
Florida, by Mr. Silas Stearns. The specimens range from 7i to 9 inches 
in length. 

This species is the southern representative of Tetrodon turgidus, from 
which it differs in several particulars, as mentioned below. 

Tlie spines of the upper parts are much larger, farther apart, dis- 
tinctly stellate with conspicuous roots; they extend backward not quite 
to front of dorsal above and to the vent below, the whole region behind 
these points being entirely smooth. There are less than 40 spines on 
the median line of the back between the eye and front of dorsal. 

The dorsal is larger than in T. turyidus, its base one-fifth to one-sixth 
as long as the head, its largest ray three-sevenths as long as head. 

The anal, also, is larger than in turgidus, its longest ray nearly one 
third as long as head. 

The humeral process is somewhat longer than in tKrgidus, its length 
from axil of pectoral being a little more than half that of head. 

Head contained 2| times, dei)th 4 times in length to caudal base. 

D. 8; A. G (D. 7; A. 5 in T. targidus). 

Color somewhat variable, but distinguished from that of turgidus by 
the i)resence of paler blotches on the back and sides, around which the 
ground color often forms distinct reticulations. Dark bars on the sides

l)laced as in T. turgidus, but much less distinct, the one in the axil of 
pectoral much smaller and less conspicuous than in T. turf/idvs. 

2. Baiostoma brachialis, u. g. and n. s. Bean. 

(Jchirus hrachialis Bean, in Goode & Bean, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mns., vol. v, p. 
235. No description. ) 

Two specimens of this species have been sent to the Museum by Mr. 
Silas Stearns: Ko. 26C05, 1.95 inches in length, from AppalachicolaBay ; 
the other, Ko. 30403, 1.45 inches in length, from South Florida. Both 
were collected in 1879. In form and in most other characters Baiostoma 
is like Achints, but it has a well-developed dextral pectoral fin. To this 
genus should, probably, be referred the MonocMr reticulata of Poey, 
which has, however, a trace of a sinistral pectoral and a greater number 
of dorsal and anal rays than B. brachialis. Tlie genus will be fully de- 
scribed in a later paper. 

Description. — The body is ovate in form, being much more angular 
in its posterior than in its anterior outline. Its height is contained 
about If times in its standard length, and is nearly twice the length of 
the head, and about three times the greatest height of the dorsal and 
anal fins. Its least height, at the base of tlie tail, is slightly greater 
than one-third its height at the ventrals and one-fourth of its greatest 
height. Its greatest thickness is equal to about twice the diameter of 
the orbit and one-third the length of the head. 

The scales of the nape, chin, and breasr, are larger than those of the 
body, and are armed with many more spinules. The scales upon the 
blind side are less strongly ctenoid than those upon the eyed side. The 
number of scales in the longitudinal series is about GO, about 53 of which 
are tube-bearing. The lateral line is almost straight upon the eyed 
side, very slightly arched in its anterior portion upon the opposite side; 
always conspicuous. The scales extend upon the dorsal, anal, and 
ventral 11ns almost two-thirds the length of the rays, but barely cover 
the base of the caudal rays. 

The pectoral is scaleless. The head is short; its length is contained 
three times in the standard body length, and four times in the total. 
The length of the snout is slightly greater than that of the eye, and is 
contained four times in the length of the head. The mouth is small, 
oblique, the dorsal outline of the head projecting far beyond the upper 
jaw in a sickle-like expansion, which almost meets the tip of the lower 
jaw when the mouth is open; the contour of the head is consequently 
very peculiar. The width of the interorbital space is equal to half that 
of the eye. The teeth are inconspicuous, and upon the eyed side appar- 
ently absent; present, however, on the blind side, but very small in both 
upper and lower jaw. 

The dorsal fin begins in advance of the tips of the jaws and contains 
47-48 rays, the greatest height in its posterior portion equalling, as has 
been stated, one-third the length of the body. 

The distance of the insertion of the anal from the tip of the snout 



414 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

equals the length of the head. The anal contains 35-37 rays, which 
. correspond in general appearance to those of the dorsal. 

The length of the caudal is one-third the standard length of the body, 
and one-fourth the total length. It is o\ate-lauceolate in form, slightly 
pointed. 

Tlie distance of the ventral from the snout equals one-third the height 
of the body. The right ventral is composed of live rays, and is con- 
nected with the anal by a low membrane. The left ventral is slightly 
smaller. Both are situated upon the ventral keel and are very close 
together, so that w'hen expanded they are in contact throughout the 
entire surface, looking like one fin. 

There is no trace whatever of a pectoral upon the sinistral, or blind 
side. The pectoral on the dextral side consists of five rays and its 
length equals one-third or two-fifths that of the head. 

Color. — Grayish or brownish on eyed side with five or six faint dark 
vertical lines, and with scattered white spots, the largest nearly equal 
in size to the eye. The blind side is whitish. 

Eaclial formula. —J). 47-48; A.3o-37 ; V. 5; P. 5 ; L. lat. GO ; tube-bear- 
ing scales 53. 

3. Hemirhombus paettilus, ii. sp. 

A single specimen, Xo. 30180, was obtained at Pensacola Florida, in 
1882, by Mr. Silas Stearns. 

Description. — Body sinistral ; general form that of an ellipse, the 
caudal extremity being considerably produced. Its height is contained 
2^ times in its length, 2§ times in its length to the end of the caudal fin, 
and is 4 times the height of the tail at its lowest portion. Its height 
at the ventrals is 3 times as great as at the tail. Its greatest width is 
equal to the diameter of the upi)er orbit. 

The scales on the cheek of the blind side are arranged in thirteen 
series; those upon the nape and interorbital space of the eyed side are 
smaller than upon the body. The scales on the body are large, thin, 
deciduous, and cycloid. There are fifty-seven scales in the lateral line, 
fifty-four of which are tube-bearing. Lateral line straight, and over 
the axis of the body, save in its anterior fourth, within which it slightly 
ascends with a very gentle upward curve, to the upper angle of the 
gill-opening. Above the lateral line are. thirteen scales; below, twenty- 
two. The vertical fins are scaly tw^o-thirds of the distance to their 
tips. 

The head is short, its length being contained 3| times in the standard 
body length, 4i tunes in the total length, and If times in the greatest 
height of body. The snout is short; its length, slightly less than the 
diameter of the lower eye, is contained 5 times in the length of the head. 
Mouth rather large, the upper edge somewhat curved, its cleft very 
oblique, the maxillary extending to below the middle of the lower eye. 
The loAver jaw extends to the vertical from the anterior margin of the 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 415 

upper eye. Length of the upper jaw equals one-third the distance from 
the snout to the nisertion of the auaL The lower jaw equals the distance 
from the tip of the snout to the posterior margin of the lower eye and is 
contained 2^ times in the length of the head. Teeth moderate, equally 
developed on both sides, in two rows in the upper jaw, those of the outer 
row upon the blind side of the upper jaw and the anterior portion of the 
eyed-side considerably larger than those in the inner row. The teeth of 
the lower jaw uniserial, almost as large as in the outer row of the upper 
jaw. 

The eyes are large, prominent, and far apart. Their longitudinal diam- 
eter equals the length of the snout, and is contained five times in the 
length of the head. Their vertical diameter is about three-fourths as 
great as their longitudinal diameter. The lower eye is far in advance of 
the upper, the vertical from the anterior margin of the upper orbit cut- 
ting the lower orbit at a point about two-thirds the distance from its ante- 
rior to its posterior margin. The upper eye is close to the dorsal profile, 
separated from it by a distance equaling about one-half its longitudinal 
diameter. The interorbital space is flattish and uneven, its width being 
contained four times in the length of the head. A projuineut ridge 
extends from the upper posterior margin of the lower eye to the lower 
posterior margin of the upper eye, thence widening and curving down- 
ward to the upper angle of the branchial aperture. The margin of 
the pre-operculum is also somewhat elevated. The length of the oper- 
culum is very slightly greater than the width of the interorbital space. 

There are eleven short and thick gill-rakers on the anterior arch, 
the loi:g3st equal in length to one-third the diameter of the eye. 

The dorsal fin begins on the blind side of the body in advance of the 
anterior margin of the lower eye; its anterior rays are almost free, the 
longest rays behind its middle, its greatest height equal to the length 
of the upper jaw. 

The anal is inserted under the anterior angle of the pectoral axilla. 
Its anterior rays are less free than are those of the dorsal, about two- 
thirds of their length being extruded from their membrane. Its outline 
similar to that of the dorsal, but greatest height somewhat less, being 
one-third the length of the head. 

The greatest length of the caudal equals the length of the head with- 
out the snout, and one-fifth of the body length. Its middle rays are 
somewhat longer than the outer rays, giving to the posterior margin 
the outline of an obtuse angle. 

The pectoral is inserted at the tip of the opercular flap ; its second 
and third rays much produced in a filamentous extension. Its greatest 
length slightly exceeds li times that of the head. The pectoral on the 
blind side has no prolonged rays ; its greatest length equalling that 
of the upper jaw. 

The ventral on the eyed side is inserted on the ridge of the abdomen 
slightly behind its mate, which is a little removed from the medial line. 



416 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Distance between insertion of the ventral and the snout equals one- 
fourth, the length of the body. The length of the ventral equals one- 
third that of the head. Vent, close to the origin of anal, and slightly 
removed from the medial point of the body on the blind side ; behind it 
a small papilla, one-fourth as long as the eye.

loglossus Bean, in Jordan & Gilbert, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mns. V, 297. 

Diagnosis. — A genus closely allied, to Oxymetopon Bleeker; but dif- 
fering from it in the absence of a keel on the head and in the smoothness 
of nearly all of the scales. The body is moderately elongate and com- 
pressed, covered with small scales, which are all cycloid excejit a few at 
the caudal base; anteriorly the scales are not imbricated, posteriorly 
they are somewhat larger and regularly imbricated, mostly' cycloid, a 
few in the tail weakly ctenoid ; no lateral line ; cheeks with imbedded 
cycloid scales. Head naked; mouth oblique, the lower jaw projecting. 
Teeth of the upper jaw in two rows, conical, slightly recurved, those in 
the outer row the largest. The two central teeth in the inner row en- 
larged, canine-like and much recurved. Teeth in lower jaw uuiserial, 
with a pair of large canines on each side. Tongue free, slender, 
and elongate, sub-terete. Vomerine and palatine teeth absent. Eyes 
moderate. Gill-openings wide, the membranes attached mesially to the 
narrow isthmus, across which they do not form a fold. Gill-rakers long 
and slender. 

Dorsal fins closely approximate; the first with six slender thread-like 
spines, the second with numerous rays, separated from the caudal by a 
considerable interval. Caudal very elongate, lanceolate, its middle 
rays filamentous. Anal similar to second dorsal. Ventrals inserted 
under the base of pectorals, closely approximate, very slightly connected 
hy a basal membrane, inner rays filamentous; i^seudo-branchise present; 
brauchiostegals, four. 

Etymology: loq, barb; yCoaao., tongue.

loglossits calliurus Bean, in Goode & Bean, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. V, 236. Name 
only ; also in Jor. & Gilb., op. cit., 297. 

The museum has received from Mr. Silas Stearns, Florida, three spe- 
cimens of a species of loglossus (Xo. 30198, one specimen ; and No. 30797, 
two specimens) taken by him at Pensacola. Professor Jordan obtained 
specimens of the same species at Pensacola from the stomach of the red- 
snapper, Liiijamis Blackfordii. 

Description. — The height of the body is contained 5^ to G times in 
its length to the origin of the middle caudal rays, and 8 to 9 times in the 
extreme length. Its greatest width equals half its height and is also 
about equal to the distance from the posterior ray of the second dorsal 
to the origin of the upper caudal rays. The least height of the tail is 
about equal to that of the head at the eye. 

The greatest length of the head is contained -4^ times in tlie standard 
body length. The width of the interorbital area is equal to the diam- 
eter of the eye and considerably greater than the length of the snout, 
which is contained 3 times in the postorbital length of the head. The 
length of the postorbital region, including the opercular flap, is cor^

taiued S times in the standard body length. Tlie upper jaw extends to 
the vertical through the anterior limb of the pupil, and its length equals 
the distance from the tip of the snout to the posterior margin of the 
orbit. The lower jaw equals the upper in length, slightly projecting 
beyond it, however, and, on account of the thickness of the chin, giving a 
heavy bulldog appearance to the head. The diameter of the eye is con- 
tained 4 times in the length of the head, the eye being inserted close to 
the upper profile. jSTostrils minute, close to the upper anterior margin 
of the orbit, double ; the two apertures placed side by side in a lateral 
line rather ttiau longitudinally, as is usual. A pair of large pores near 
the upper posterior margin of the orbit, and a series of three or four 
similar pores along the posterior limb of the preoperculum ; others 
scattered here and there over the head. Operculum membranous; gill- 
openings very wide, the upper angle of the branchial aperture located 
close to the upper angle of the pectoral base. About 10 teeth in the 
lower jaw in advance of the double canines. Teeth behind the canines 
iniuute; 14 or more on each side. Teeth in the upper jaw much more 
uniform than in the lower; at least 30 in the inner row. Slight granu- 
lations, or asperities, upon the vomer ; palatines toothless. 

The distance of the first dorsal from the snout is contained 3i to 4 
times in the standard body length, the base of the first dorsal being 
equal to the height of the body ; the distance between the fifth and 
sixth dorsal rays being double the distance between the other rays. The 
dorsal contains six slender filamentous rays, the greatest length of the 
longest being nearly or quite equal to the length of the head. The 
point of insertion of this fin is somewhat variable in its location, some- 
times directly over that of the ventral and sometimes a little behind. 
The interspace between the first and second dorsal fins is equal to the 
width of the base of the pectoral. The second dorsal fin contains 
twenty-two or twenty-three slender, filamentous rays, those in the 
anterior portion being slightly longer than the others, and equal in 
length to the greatest height of the body. 

Insertion of anal midway between the tip of snout and the base of 
caudal fin. The anal pa]nlla large and located close to the vent. The 
anal fin contains 20 to 22 rays, about as long as those of the second 
dorsal, but much stouter, and apparently used in burrowing. 

The caudal is lanceolate and extremely elongate. The length of the 
middle rays slightly greater than half that of the body, or one-third of 
the total length of the fish. 

The pectoral is inserted directly over the ventrals. Its length is about 
equal to the height of the body, its base broad, vertically placed, and 
equal in width to the length of the operculum. The ventrals are com- 
osed of a spine and four filameutous rays ; their length greater than 
that of the head, the tips reaching almost or quite to the vent; they are 
distinct, though slightly united by a basal meinbrane ; their insertion 
is closer to the tip of the snout than to the vent.

Dorsal spines slender, the longest contained 2^ times in length of 
head; the longest soft ray half as long as head. Caudal subtruncate, 
its angles rounded, its length four-fifths that of head. 

Anal spines small, the second and third equal, contained 2| times in 
length of head. Soft anal rays high, the longest half as long as head. 

Ventrals contained If times in length of head, the last rays joined to 
the belly by a broad membrane which extends nearly to their tips. 

Pectorals reach to soft rays of anal, the longest ray slightly shorter 
than head. The base of the fin is a little procurrent, its length one-tbird 
that of head, the lowermost rays rapidly shortened.

large as the nostril. The jaws dusky, marbled with whitish; ^ides of 
back with diifuse blackish blotches. Entire body sparsely covered with 
round dusky spots smaller than the pnpil; these spots are most numer- 
ous and distinct in the axillary region, which is otherwise whitish. 
Skin of shoulder-girdle above marbled with black. Spinous doi'sal with 
a broad, median, dusky band ; tips of its membranes dusky, its base 
whitish, with black spots. Soft dorsal and anal irregularly marbled 
with blackish. Caudal with a broad median, and a terminal band of 
blackish. Pectorals blackish above, with dark spots ; lower edge whitish ; 
three obscure, broad, dusky cross-bands. Ventrals dusky towards the 
tips. 

The type of this species is numbered 30,1G9; it is G^^,- inches long, and 
was obtained at Peusacola, Florida, by Mr. Silas Stearns, to whom the 
species is dedicated in appreciation of his services in adding to our 
knowledge of the fishes of the Gulf of Mexico. 

A smaller ScorpKna ^-^^ inches long (No. 30,185), from the same local- 
ity, agrees with the type of S. stearnsii in all respects, except that the 
preorbital and supraorbital fla])S are very much longer, the latter reach- 
ing the front of dorsal, its length half that of head. The preorbital 
flap is as long as the pupil. The margins of both these flaps are with- 
out fringes. In the type of >S^. Stearnsii the supraorbital flap is nearly 
as broad as long, not so long as the pupil, and is distinctly trilobate; 
the preorbital is minute. Without additional material it is impossible 
to decide whether these difi'erences are sexual or of specific value. 

10. Scorpaena calcarata, u. sp. 

The type of this species is numbered 2356G ; it is 2^ inches long, and 
was taken in Clear Water Harbor, Florida, by Dr. J. W. Velie. The 
specimen is in poor condition. 

Body moderately robust, the greatest depth slightly less than a third 
of length to caudal base, the lower jaw slightly projecting, with a small 
symphysial knob. The maxillary reaches to past the pupil; its length 
equal to half that of head. 

The preorbital has three diverging spines ; the suborbital without pit, 
the bony stay moderate, armed with two small spines. Nasal spines 
small. Interorbital space narrow, with two longitudinal ridges, its 
width two-fifths length of eye. The cranial ridges are rather low, with 
sharp spines, the following pairs present: preocular, supraocular, post- 
ocular, coronal, occipital, nuchal, besides three or four on the temporal 
region. Occipital cavity almost obsolete, represented by a slight de- 
pression. 

Preopercular spines five, the lowermost stout, directed downward and 
forward, the uppermost rather long — more than half as long as the eye. 
Opercular and scapular spines moderate. Eye large, nearly one-third 
as long as the head. Supraocular flaps minute; a few other small flaps 
on the head. 

Cheeks with rather large imbricated scales; opercle with some

scales anteriorly aud on its flaj^ ; breast scaly ; scales of body large, not 
ctenoid, with few dermal flaps or none. 

Pores of lateral line very conspicuous. Gill-rakers short and small. 
Dorsal spines rather slender, the longest contained 2| times in length 
of head ; the longest soft ray 2J times in length of head. 

Anal spines small, the second and third subequal, one-third as loug as 
head. Soft anal rays moderate, the longest half as loug as the head. 

The ventrals reach past vent, their leugth contained If times in that 
of head, the last rays largely united to the belly by a membrane.

Scales in about 28 series, the number being uncertain because many 
of them are rubbed off. There are about 25 tubes in the lateral line. 

Color mostly obliterated, dusky grayish marbled with blackish; a 
black suborbital bar; a black bar at caudal base; axil of pectoral 
whitish with dusky specks, a black spot at its upper edge ; ventrals 
mostly black. 

11. Gerres olisthostoma, n. sp. 

Mr. E. E. Earll, when engaged in the fishery-census investigation 
upon the coast of Florida, obtained at Indian River six specimens (No. 
25118), of a new species of Gerres. They are known as the "Irish pom- 
pano" and "hog-fish." This species is one of the largest of the genus, 
and in general form resembles Gerres gula and G. homonymus, haAing 
short thick body, very protractile snout, elevated dorsal and elongate 
ventral fins. This species is reported to be rather common in the Indian 
Kiver region; it is evidently the same as Xo. 125G1, referred by Poey 
to Gerres rhombeus. The true rhomheus has, also, been sent to the Mu- 
seum by Professor Poey. 

Description. — A Gerres, with short, thick body, the greatest height 
of which, at the ventrals, is contained twice in its length and 2f times 
in the distance from its snout to the tip of the upper caudal lobe. Its 
least height at the base of the tail, being one-quarter of its greatest 
height. The greatest width of the body is equal to the greatest height 
of the tail. 

The scales are large, somewhat loosely set ; 39 in the lateral line ; 
above it 7; below it 11. Jaws entirely naked, as well as the ordinary 
patch over the groove for the reception of the protractile snout. The 
greatest length of the head is contained 3;^ times in that of the body ; 
the greatest width of the head is equal to half its length, and is half as 
wide again as the interorbital area. The leugth of snout is equal to the 
diameter of the eye; the length of the operculum, including the flap, 
equals one-fifth of the greatest height of the body. The length of the 
groove for the reception of the premaxillaries equals the length of the 
maxillary. The upper jaw when protruded extends beyond the tip of 



424 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

the maxillary a distance equal to the least height of the tail. Teeth 
brush-like, iu bauds; the baud of the upper jaw more developed than 
that of the lower oue, the leugth of the baud equaliug half that of the eye. 
The maxillary extends to the perpendicular through the anterior margin 
of the pupil; the mandible, to the vertical through the posterior margin 
of the eye. The leugth of the mandible equals half that of the head. 
The preoperculum is denticulated on its lower border and at the angle, 
the denticulations at the angle being slightly the largest. The gdl- 
rakers are short, 12 iu number ou the anterior arch below the angle, the 
longest one- fifth as long as the eye. The eye equals the snout iu length, 
and is contained 3§ to 4 times in the length of the head. The naked 
space above the premaxillary groove in the majority of the types is 
prolonged backwards to an acute point, but in two of the types the 
acute point is replaced by a scaly space. 

The distance of the spinous dorsal from the snout equals about IJ 
times the length of the head. It is inserted nearly over the middle of 
the pectoral base. The position of this fin varies very slightly in differ- 
ent individuals. The subsequent spines to the seventh are much stouter 
aud longer than any of the others, and are so graduated iu length that, 
when the fin is erect, the outline of the anterior portion i)resents nearly 
the figure of an isosceles triangle. The last two spines are nearly equal 
iu leugth. The length of the first ray of tlie soft dorsal is nearly double 
that of the last dorsal spine; the last ray being about as long as the 
first. The spines aud rays all protrude from one-half to one-third of 
their length beyond the membrane, giving to the fin a ragged appear- 
ance. The basal sheath of the dorsal fin is thick and prominent. 

The insertion of the anal is equidistant between the tip of the snout 
and the tip of the upper caudal lobe, the fin being inserted under the 
perpendicular from the fourth dorsal ray. The first anal spine is short 
and stout, being half as long as the diameter of the eye; the second 
very stout, uot quite so long as the third, being equal in length to the 
distance from the center of the eye to the end of the operculum. The 
first ray of the anal is also elongate, giving to this fin, when expanded, 
the appearance of an isosceles triangle, with base somewhat slenderer 
than that described in the first dorsal. The soft anal in its posterior 
part is lower than the soft dorsal. 

The caudal fin is deeply forked, the longest ray of the upper lobe be- 
ing equal to about one-third of the body length, and five times as long 
as the inner rays. 

The pectoral is inserted at the tip of the opercular flap, and has its 
upper rays elongate, equalling the head in length. 

The ventral is inserted beneath the axil of the pectoral at a distance 
from the snout equal to two-fifths of the length of the body. Its spine 
is as long as the fourth spiue of the dorsal, but double as stout, the first 
ray being j)rolonged.

It seems desirable to state that the proportions in this species differ 
very considerably with individuals.

12. Calamus arctifrons, n. sp. 

A species belonging to Calamus of Swainson. The type numbered 
30163 is a specimen 9i inches long, collected at Pensacola, Florida, by 
Mr. Silas Stearns. 

Body oblong ovate, more elongate than is usual in species of this 
group, deepest at origin of dorsal, the greatest depth being contained 
nearly 2^ times in the total length to caudal base. Anterior profile 
evenly curved, unusually convex. A blunt protuberance before eye. 
Mouth comparatively large, the maxillary barely reaching the vertical 
from front of orbit. Length of upper jaw contained 2^ times in head. 
The anterior teeth of both Jaws are conical, rather strong and canine- 
hke, 6 to 8 in each jaw. Behind these are bands of cardiform teeth. 
Molars rather large, in two rows anteriorly and three posteriorly in 
upper jaw ; two rows in the lower ; the molars of the inner series of both 
jaws much larger than the others. Lower jaw slightly included. Be- 
hind the upper lip on each side is an enlarged oblong pore, two-thirds 
as long as the posterior nostril; above it is a fleshy flap. The posterior 
nostrils slit-like and much larger than the circular anterior ones. Pre- 
orbital very deep, its depth, from eye to angle of mouth, contained 3^ 
times in length of head. Eye rather small, placed very high, its diam- 
eter contained 3f times in length of head, and equaling four-fifths of 
the convex interorbital space. Cheeks with 5 to 6 series of scales. 
Four rows of scales on the opercle. Opercle very short, its length 
equaling two-thirds diame ter of eye, and less than one-third of its 
height. Gill-rakers very short, thickish, few. Least depth of tail two- 
thirds length of caudal peduncle and contained 3^ times in head. 

The length of the head is contained 3i times in total to caudal base. 
Interorbital space contained 3^ times in length of head. The oblique 
distance from snout to origin of spinous dorsal is slightly less than half 
the total length to caudal base. Dorsal spines slender, the longest 
(fourth) contained 3|- times in length of head and about equal to long- 
est ray of second dorsal. 

Distance from front of anal to base of caudal contained 3y times in 
total. xVnal spines small, graduated, the third one-fourth as long as 
head. The second spine somewhat stronger, but shorter, than the third. 

Caudal deeply forked, its middle rays two-fifths as long as the outer. 
The upper lobe is nearly as long as the head. 

Pectoral narrow, reaching slightly past vent, as long as head. 

Ventrals inserted slightly behind pectoral origin, five-eighths as long 
as the head. A partly-concealed procnmbent spine before the dorsal. 
First spine less than two-fifths as long as second, which is not much 
shorter than the third.

Two specimens, No. 30795, of a new species of Stenotomus were ob- 
tained, from the stomachs of red snapper at Pensacola, Florida, by Mr. 
Silas Stearns. Two were also similarly obtained by Professor Jordan at 
Pensacola. It is distinguished from >S^. versicolor by the presence of two 
short spines in advance of the elongate spines of the first dorsal, by the 
great elongation of the anterior dorsal spines, and by the greater depth 
of the cheeks and preorbital region. 

Description. — Body irregular oblong-ovate. Its height is contained 
twice in its length. Its height at the tail is contained 4^ times in its 
greatest height, and a little more than three times in the length of the 
head. 

Scales in lateral line 45 to 47 ; above it, seven ; below, fourteen. An- 
terior profile protuberant over the eyes; mouth moderate, maxillary 
arching almost to the vertical from the anterior margin of the orbit. 
Length of the ui)i)er jaw contained 2f times iu that of head. There 
are ten narrow compressed incisors in the front of the upper jaw, and 
the same number in Iront of the lower jaw. Two rows of small molars 
in each jaw, the inner series very slightly larger than the outer. 

Eyes circular, their diameter contained 3^ times in the length of the 
head. 

Distance between insertion of dorsal and snout contained 2;^ times in 
length of body. In front of the elongate dorsal rays are two nj) right 
and slightly curved spines, the height of which equals the diameter of 
the pupil, and a well-developed spine of about the same length project- 
ing forward horizontally. The dorsal spines, from the third to the 
seventh, inclusive, are much elongated, filamentous, the length of the 
first being equal to the length of the pectoral fin, and contained 2^ 
times in the body length. The base of the dorsal is equal to half the 
distance from tip of snout to the end of the middle caudal rays. 

The anal is inserted in the perpendicular from the origin of the soft 
dorsal, almost equidistant between the tip of the snout and the tip of 
the upper caudal lobe. The three anal spines are stout, the second and 
third being the longest and of equal length, slightly shorter than the 
anal rays. The length of the base of anal equals the length of the 
sixth dorsal sjiine, and also the length of the ventral. 

Caudal fin forked. The outer rays of the lower lobe twice as long as

the uiiddle lays, those of the upper lobe slightly less than those of the 
lower lobe. 

Pectoral inserted in the vertical from the middle of the space between 
the third and fourth dorsal spines, its length being equal to the height 
of the body at the insertion of the anal ; its longest ray reaches from 
the perpendicular to the fourth ray of the soft anal. 

Ventral inserted in the perpendicular from the origin of the fifth dor- 
sal spine; length almost equal to that of the sixth dorsal spine. 

Color. — Silvery gray, slightly olivaceous above. Professor Jordan 
states that in fresli specimens there are iaint ti-aces of dark cross-bands, 
and that the posterior margin is probably blackish.

National Museum, Vol. II, p. 143, as T. hrunneus Poey, and which by 
previous writers was catalogued under the name T. acutirostris, having 
proved distinct from both of these species, we now propose to describe 
as new under the name T. stomias. The Museum has received five 
specimens, a tabulated list of which is here given.

This species is the black grouper of Pensacola, a fish of some com- 
mercial importance. Specimens were aTso obtained at Pensacola in 
1882 by Jordan, who states that it is almost as abundant as the red 
grouper, Epinephelus morio, and reaches a weight of 40 pounds. 

Description. — A Trisotropis with body moderately compressed. Its 
greatest height slightly more than one-fourth its length without caudal, 
and equal to or slightly less that 3 times as great as the least height of the 
tail; length of the head three-eighths length of the body and 3^ times 
length of the snout; the lower jaw projects beyond the upper a distance 
equaling one-half the diameter of the eye. The maxillary extends to the 
vertical from the center of the eye, and the mandible almost to the vertical 
from its posterior margin. The distance of the eye from the upper profile 
of the head is about equal to half of the vertical diameter of the orbit. 
The horizontal diameter of the eye is contained 1| times in the length 
of the snout, almost 3 times in the postorbital portion of the head, and 
exactly twice in the length of the 0])erculum to the tip of its flap. 
Lower jaw without canines. The teeth in two rows, those in the inner 
row being double the length of those in the outer row and much less

namerous. The teeth in the upper jaw very irregular in size, and hardly 
specialized, excepting in two patches at each side of the sympyhsis. 
Two moderate sized canines in advance of these patches. Vomerine 
teeth numerous and feeble. Palatine teeth very weak and with incon- 
spicuous bands upon the crest of the bone. Preoperculum with mi- 
nute denticulations, somewhat stronger at the angle. The length of 
the intermaxillary is considerably more than half that of the lower jaw. 

Distance of insertion of dorsal from snout equals the greatest length 
of head including the opercular flap, the dorsal origin being very slightly 
in advance of the insertion of the ventral, which is located under the 
base of the third dorsal spine. Length of third dorsal spine is equal to 
that of the intermaxillary. 

Distance of anal from snout about equal to twice the length of the 
head, the length of its base being slightly greater than the greatest 
length of the pectoral. The second anal spine is the stoutest, and 
is twice as long as the first, while the third, which is slender, is 2i 
times as long as the first. 

Distance of pectoral from snout is one-third the standard body length. 

Distance of ventral from snout is equal to twice the postorbital 
length of the head. The length of the ventral is slightly more than 
one-eighth of the standard body length (one-sixth or more in smaller 
specimens). 

The length of the middle caudal rays is equal to the distance from the 
posterior margin of the orbit to the tip of the largest opercular spine. 
The upper and lower lobes of the caudal produce an incurving, gi%ing 
to the space between the lobes a semicircular outline.

of the National Museum, Vol. II, p. 141. 

15. Hypoplectrus gemma, n. sp. 

A single specimen. No. 3422, of a new species of Plectropoma, has for 
many years been preserved in the museum. Name of collector unknown. 
In general appearance this species resembles Rypoplectrus nigricans of 
Poey, a specimen of which from the same locality was found in the same 
bottle and recorded under catalogue number 3423. In shape it is also 
similar to Hypoplectrus pnclla, but its coloration appears to have been 
much more uniform. The crescent-shaped caudal is a diagnostic mark, 
by which it can be distinguished from all other species now accessible 
to us. 

Description. — Greatest height of the body is contained 3 times in 
its total length, and 2^ times in its standard length. Greatest width 
equals length of second dorsal sphie; least height of the tail is con- 
tained 3 times in the length of the head. The scales are small, weakly

ctenoid, there being about 76 in the lateral line, 9 above it, and 20 below. 
The lateral line follows very closely the contour of the dorsal profile 
throughout its entire extent. Greatest length of the head is contained 
3 times in the distance from the tip of the snout to the end of the mid- 
dle caiuUil rays. Greatest width of head is about equal to the width of 
the body. Length of snout is contained 3 times in the length of the 
head. Length of the operculum to the end of the flap equals the length 
of the snout. The upper jaw extends to the vertical from the anterior 
margin of the orbit ; its length is equal to half that of the head ; the 
lower jaw is about the same length. The armature and squamation of 
the opercular bones are normal, as is likewise the dentition. The diam- 
eter of the eye equals one-fourth length of the head. 

The distance of the dorsal fin from the snout is very slightly less than 
the greatest height of tlie body, the length of the dorsal base equalling 
the distance between its origin and the base of the posterior ray of the 
anal fin. Its fourth spine is the longest, its length equaling that of the 
base of the anal. 

■ The anal fin is inserted below the origin of the second dorsal ray, the 
base of its ultimate ray being beneath that of the ninth dorsal ray. 
Its third spine is very slightly longer than the second ; their diameters 
are equal. The anal is higher than the dorsal, its greatest height being 
equal to the distance between the base of the ventrals and the origin of 
the anal tin. 

The caudal is crescent-shaped, the external rays being much pro- 
longed, especially those of the upper lobe, which are twice as long as 
the middle caudal rays. 

Distance of pectorals from snout equals the height of the body at 
the ventrals, their length being equal to that of the superior caudal 
lobe. When extended horizontally these fins reach to the vertical from 
the insertion of the first anal ray. 

Distance of the ventrals from the snout equals half the standard 
body-length. They extend to the insertion of the anal, and are equal 
in length to the rays of the lower caudal lobe.

16. Menidia dentesr, ii. sp. 

The types of the present description. No. 18051, were taken at the 
mouth of the Saint John's Eiver, Florida, by Prof. S. F. Baird. There 
are ten individuals in the lot, varying in length from 2a to U inches. 
The three which are made the special types of this description measure 
3^, 4f , and 4^ inches, respectively. 



430 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The species may be at once distinguished from M. peninsidcv and il/. 
vagrans by the smaller number of dorsal spines and the larger number 
of anal rays, as well as by the stronger teeth; the teetli are much 
stronger than those of Menidia notata, the body is deeper, and there are 
fewer scales in a longitudinal series. From M. boscii of J. & G. it differs 
in its smaller eye, position of first dorsal, stronger teeth, and fewer scales 
in the lateral line. 

The head, in shape and squamation, agrees with that of other species; 
its length is very slightly less than the greatest depth of the body, and 
is contained from 4^ to 4| times in total length to caudal base (end of 
silvery band). The eye is a little shorter than snout, equals width of 
interorbital space, and is two-sevenths as long as the head. The snout 
is almost one-third as long as the head. Mouth rather large, the strougly 
curved and freely i^rotractile intermaxillary being as long as the snout. 
Teeth in narrow bands, the outer series in both jaws much enlarged, a 
pair of canine-like teeth in the inner series at the symphysis of upper 
jaw. Lower jaw much longer than eye, as long as second dorsal base, 
contained 2| times in length of head. Jaws equal. 

The greatest depth of the body equals the distance iii'om origin of first 
dorsal to end of second dorsal, or nearly so. The origin of spinous dor- 
sal is midway between tip of snout and end of middle caudal rays, im- 
mediately above anal origin. Longest dorsal spine one-third as long as 
head. Longest ray of soft dorsal equals length of head without post- 
orbital part; it also equals two-thirds of length of pectoral. The ventral 
is inserted under the ninth scale in a longitudinal series; its length is 
about one-half that of the head; it does not quite reach the vent. The 
length of anal base equals twice that of head without postorbital part. 
The length of middle caudal rays equals one-eighth of total length to end 
of silvery band; the external rays are about 1^ times as long as the 
middle rays. Only the caudal fin is scaly, and that for half its length. 

Light olivaceous; minute brown punctulations on the jaws, top of 
head, and around the posterior margins of the scales of the back.

19. Cyprinodon mydrus, n. sp. 

Two specimens, No. 30479, were collected by Silas Stearus, atPensa- 
cola, Florida. This species is most closely related to C. gibbosus Baird & 
Girard, from which it is distinguished by its much larger eye (the diam- 
eter of which is considerably greater than the length of the operculuDi, 
to which in G. gibbosus it is equal) ; by the greater number of dorsal rays, 
of which there are 13; by the smaller number of its anal rays, of which 
there are 29; by the smaller number of its scales, which in the lateral line 
is 24; by the smaller number of scales iu the transverse line, 9 in num- 
ber; by the longer tail and the greater size of the ventral fin. 

The color of this species is silvery, the back being olivaceous, and 
the sides marked \^ith seven or eight indistinct vertical bands. The 
scales are large, and their outlines are strongly marked, giving to the 
fish the appearance of a piece of hammered metal work ; hence the spe- 
cific name, which is derived from fio5pn<;, '< a lump of metal." 

Description. — Body short; similar in shape to females of C. gibbosus. 
Mouth small, terminal. Premaxillaries very protractile. Humeral scale 
scarcely as large as the contiguous scales ; one-third as long as the head, 
and equal to the width of interorbital space. 

Origin of the dorsal midway between the tip of the snout and the 
root of the caudal. 

Origin of the dorsal and ventrals equidistant from the tip of snout. 
Dorsal fin, when depressed, not extending to the caudal. The longest 
dorsal ray equal to length of head without snout. Length of head is 
contained 3 times in the standard body length. Height of body is con- 
tained 2^ times in the same length. 

20. Zygonectes craticula, n. sp. 

The types of this species, 'No. 31439, were obtained in a small branch 
of Elbow Creek, a tributary of Indian River, in East Florida, by Dr. 
J. A. Henshall, of Cynthiaua, Kentucky, and a second lot, ^No. 28500, 
were obtained in July and August, 1880, at Nashville, Georgia, by Mr. 
W. J. Taylor. The relations of this beautiful species are with that de- 
scribed by Agassiz under the name Z.dispar. 

Body stout, moderately compressed, especially posteriorly; head 
moderately broad and flattened above. Interorbital space flat, its 
width less than half the length of the head and 1^ times the diameter 
of the eye. The distance between the eyes above is greater than below. 
Snout rather obtuse, its length equal to that of the eye. The total 
length of the head is contained 3^ times in the standard length and 4i 
times in the total length of the body. Teeth in narrow bands, the 
outer series in both jaws enlarged and somewhat recurved. Scales 
moderate ; 36 in lateral line, 10 in transverse series. 

Fins small ; dorsal smaller than anal, and inserted over the 20th 
scale in the longitudinal series, and slightly behind the anal insertion ; 
somewhat nearer to the end of the tail than to the tip of the snout.

434 PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The veiitrals and pectorals moderate, the length of the latter almost 
equaling the height of the body at the ventrals. 

Color. — Brilliant, the ground color being yellowish-white with six 
deep black longitudinal stripes equidistant from each other ; broader 
anteriorly ; about as wide as the interspaces, and almost coalescing at 
the base of the caudal fin, an indistinct stripe of same width on each 
side of the dorsal line, about midway between the uppermost of the 
black lines and the center of the body. Cheeks brilliant white, a deep 
black blotch under and confluent with the eye. Dorsal and anal fins 
with indistinct blackish longitudinal lines. Sides of certain individ- 
uals, apparently males, with eleven or twelve distinct vertical bars, 
about equal in width to the longitudinal bars, the arrangement of 
these intersecting stripes suggesting the idea of a gridiron, whence 
the name " craticula.''^ 

Length of the largest individuals about 2^ inches. 

Radial formula.— D.l ; A, 9-10. Scales 3G— 10. 

21. Stolephorus perthecatus, n. sp. 

A single specimen 3.6 inches long, No. 30483, was collected by Mr. 
Silas Stearns, at Pensacola, Florida. 

Description.— Body not carinated or serrated, somewhat compressed. 
Height of body contained 5 times in its length without caudal, and about 
C times in its total length. Length of head contained 32 times in 
standard length. Diameter of the eye greater than length of snout and 
contained ^ times in length of head. Width of eye equal to that of 
interorbital space. Snout conical, slightly compressed. Teeth minute 
in both jaws. Maxillary with acute tip, extending back almost to the 
gill-opening; toothed to the posterior angle of the straight inferior 
edge. Gill-rakers rather numerous, the longest two-thirds as lon^ as 
the diameter of the eye. 

Origin of the dorsal fin midway between root of caudal fin and the 
center of the pupil, and also between the tip of the snout and the end 
of the middle caudal rays. 

Anal fin inserted vertically below penultimate ray of dorsal fin. 

Pectorals considerably longer than ventrals and more than half as 
long as head, their tips falling short of reaching the origin of the ven- 
trals by a distance almost equal to the diameter of the eye. 

Ventrals half as long as lower jaw, inserted far in advance of the 
dorsal, their tips reaching to the perpendicular of the origin of the dor- 
sal. 

Axillary sheaths exceedingly large ; in the case of ventrals and pec- 
torals almost equaling the length of the fins. 

Silvery stripe narrow, one-fourth height of body at the ventrals, not 
more than half as wide as the eye. Scales in lateral line about 38. 

Radial formula.— D. ii, 11 ; A. i, 16.

also, in Jor. & Gilb., op. cit., 262. 

Eye equal to snout, 4^ in liead. Lips moderately developed. The 
posterior nostril is small, on a line with the lower edge of the pupil j 
the anterior nostril tubular near the intermaxillary symphysis. Upper 
jaw longer than the lower ; the cleft of the mouth extends to the hind 
margin of the pupil. The patch of intermaxillary teeth subrectangular, 
scarcely a third as long as the eye ; vomerine teeth in a patch one-third 
as long as the eye, ta])ering behind. The outer series of maxillary 
teeth contains 38 close-set, slightly trun(5ate teeth, continued backwards 
after a slight interruption by six conical teeth which rake forward. In 
the mandible are about 36 close-set slightly truncate teeth, extended for- 
ward by a patch of conical teeth. The teeth in the main rows of both 
jaws are biserial. The length of the head is contained a little more 
than 1^ times in that of the trunk and 6 times in total length ; the 
length of the tail exceeds that of the rest of the animal by the length 
of the hiead without the snout. The dorsal fin commences over the an- 
terior part of the j^ectoral. The pectoral is a little more than one-third 
as long as the head. The width of the gill-opening equals one-half of 
the length of the postorbital part of the head. The color in the present 
partially digested condition of the fish is mainly light olive. The ver- 
tical fins are well developed ; their coloration cannot be made out. The 
distance between the eyes is less than one-half of their diameter. The 
lower jaw extends beyond the hind margin of the eye and equals the 
distance from the end of the snout to the hind margin of the eye ; it also 
equals the greatest depth of the head ; the greatest width of the head 
equals one-half its length without the snout. 

The type of the species, number 30709, was sent from Pensacola, Flor- 
ida, by Mr. Silas Stearns. Its length is 13 inches. 

23. Muraena retifera, n. sp. 

Body moderately stout, somewhat compressed, its greatest depth 
equaling two-thirds length of head. 

Teeth of upper jaw in two series, the outer series composed of a few 
short fixed teeth; the inner series of about 10 long compressed teeth, a

profile not at all convex; the premaxillaries projecting well beyond the 
front of the snont. Mouth very large, oblique, the jaws subeqnal, or 
the lower slightly projecting; maxillary extending far beyond the eye 
to nearly oi)posite the middle of the cheek, its length being a little 
more than half head. Teeth in moderate bauds, slender, the outer 
series moderately enlarged. Eyes large, placed close together, as long 
as snout, about 4.J in head. 

Body entirely scaleless. Fins all somewhat mutilated, so that the 
numbers of fin-rays are not readily ascertained, especially in the anal. 
Dorsal spines very slender and flexible; base of soft dorsal forming 
about two-fifths length of body ; the fin well separated from the spinous 
dorsal. Caudal rather short, its tip apparently convex. Anal fin long. 
Pectorals and ventrals mutilated, apparently of moderate length. 

Color light olivaceous; back, sides, and upper fins speckled with 
dark olive ; caudal with 3 or 4 dark olive cross-bars ; head with some 
dark markings; lower fins pale. 

The type is a female specimen 2 inches in length, full of nearly ripe 
ova. It was obtained from the stomach of a specimen of Hexagrammns 
aiqyer, captured by the writers in Saanich Arm, on the eastern shore of 
Vancouver's Island, in June, 1880. The specimen has been somewhat 
injured by the process of digestion, but all the distinctive characters 
can be readily made out. Its slender body and large mouth distinguish 
it at once from most species of the genus.

Ophibolus getulus niger, subsp. nov. 

In a valuable and interesting collection of reptiles, from Wheatland, 
Indiana, made by Mr. Eobert Eidgway in 1881 were three specimens 
of Ophibolus which difter so materially from the ordinary Ophibolus 
getulus that it seems necessary to assign them a position as a sub- 
species, and the above name is therefore proposed. 

Description.— Color entirely black with the exception of the under 
part of the head; upper and lower labials marked like the typical 
0. getulus. Head plates entirely black, not spotted, and in none of the 
specimens examined are light central spots on the head- scales to be seen. 
Verticals, occipitals, and superciliaries more elongated and narrower 
than in the normal type; frontals and prefrontals about the same. 
Abdominal scutell^ plumbeous white spotted, not yellow. A peculiarity 
of the type specimens from which this description is prepared is that 
the third, fourth, and fifth postabdominal scutellte are entire, not

divided; but this last trait Las been noticed in other species of the 
genus. In the specimen described, on the second and third row of 
scales are a few sparsely scattered wlnte spots resembling those of 
0. sayi, but there is no approach to regularity, nor is there any indica- 
tion of a pattern. No. 12149, ad., Wheatland, Ind.; 7 upper labials on 
both sides, 9 lower on one, 10 on the other; 12 rows of scales, 1 ante- 
orbital, 2 postorbitals; length 4 feet inches. 

A younger specimen 3 feet 4 iuclies long is similar in appearance to 
the older one, but there seems to be a tendency to a greater display of 
the white spots on the sides. Color of the back lustrous black; belly 
dull black, with milk-white maculatious. Isolated and minutely punctu- 
lated spots on the back show a decided approach to a pattern of color- 
ation as in 0. getulus. In two specimens of 0. getuhis, Nos. 9109 and 
8797, from Marietta, Ga., and Augusta, Ga., the cross-markings of white 
spots are almost obsolete, like those of the young specimens of 0. getulus 
niger; but on the sides the white blotches are large and strongly defined, 
which is not the case in 0. getulus niger. The heads, too, are yellow 
spotted. Mr. E. Ridgway and Mr. L. Turner inform me that the sub- 
species described is quite common in both Indiana and Illinois, and 
that it has doubtless replaced the normal 0. getulus, which in those 
States has not been collected by either of these gentlemen. 

Ophibolus getulus .eiseni, subsp. nov. 

A number of specimens of Ophiholns getulus hoyli have been found in 
a collection of reptiles made by Mr. Gustav Eisen, at Fresno, Cal., and 
among them are three specimens diflering so materially from the type 
that it is proposed to name them provisionally for their discoverer. 

DescPwIPTIon. — Plates of the liead similar to those of 0. getulus hoyli: 
1 anteorbital, 3 postorbitals, 7 upper labials, 10 lower labials ; 23 rows 
of scales on body ; difterence, so far as the head is concerned, being an 
increase in number of postorbitals and lower labials. 

Color markedly different from the type of 0. getulus hoyli. The first 
white annulus, three scales wide, commences 11 scales posteriorly to the 
occipitals; there is then an interval of 5 scales to second white annulus, 
another interval of 5 scales to the third white annulus, which instead of 
passing down towards the abdomen, expands at the base, and joins an 
oval ring 8 scales wide transversely to the body, and 8 scales long pos- 
teriorly. Eight scales behind this ring a white line IJ scales wide com- 
mences, which extends the length of body to opposite the 207th ab- 
dominal scale, or about the 30th from the anus. This line is absolutely 
continuous, but breaks oft" into annuli at the place mentioned. There 
are then a triangular white blotch, 3 annuli, another blotch, and the 
dorsal line commences again and ends at tip of tail. At a distance of 
4 scales below this dorsal line, on both sides, are indications of lines, 
and near the borders of the mentioned scales are broken and obsolete 
whitish blotches.

Ophibolus getulus multicinctus, siibsp. nov. 

This name is proposed for a subspecies collected by Mr. Gustav 
Eisen, at Fresno, Cal. 

Description. — Smaller in size tban 0. getidus boyli, to which the 
coloration gives it a similarity of appearance. Head smaller and more 
elongated than 0. getidus boyli; neck compressed, scales in twenty- 
three ro^'s, smooth and lanceolate. Kostral wider than broad, post- 
frontals very large; two nasals, nostril between; oneloral; auteorbitals 
one; pnstorbitals two; vertical elongated without angles on sides, re- 
sembling an inverted cone; occipitals longer than broad, having each 
a small scale at the angular basal end. Upper labials 7, lower labials 
9. Eye above uot<ih between third and fourth upper labials Post- 
abdominal scutella entire, caudal all divided. There are 49 black bands 
from occipitals to end of tail, the 42d opposite the anus. 

General color of body dirty white, tbe borders of the sides being 
brown. Upper part of bead as far posteriorly as last third of occip- 
itals, pitchy black. Behind tbis commences a white band extend- 
ing and expanding on each side of tbe head, taking in the last two 
upper labials, passing completely around. Posterior to this are a black 
band six scales wide, and a reddish-brown band 4 scales wide. From 
the head, posteriorly, the black bauds increase in width, being 5i scales 
"wide on the middle of the body; tbe white bands are here narrower 
embracing 3 scales only. In many of the black bauds there is a ten- 
dency at the bases to split np into reddish-white blotches, and one 
or two of them notably near the head are almost entirely divided by 
the running upwards of the blotches.

thirds webbed, shovel very small and light colored. Two carpal tuber- 
cles, external large, both oval; one small rounded tubercle. Color in 
old specimens, bluish gray, darker on sides, with orange-colored tuber- 
cles. Legs banded with same color as on sides. Belly yellowish wliite, 
with bluish spots near insertion of both arms. In young specimens the 
color of the back is yellowish gray, tlie sides being darker, the tuber- 
cles being bright orange. Resembles somewhat Bufo microscaphus, in 
general outline, but the coloration is very different. ^Named in honor 
or Mr. L. Belding, the collector of the specimen.

Crotaphytus copeii, sp. no v. 

Description.— Head broader and longer than C. wisUzenl. Super- 
ciliary ridges well developed. Anterior border of auditory aperture 
with one, two, or three larger scales than the surrounding ones. Scales 
anterior to orbits, and posterior to nostrils, on upper surface of head, 
larger than elsewhere. Scales on gular fold larger than those anteriorly 
or posteriorly. Upper and lower labials fifteen each to angle near base 
of jaw. Infraorbital chain consists of four i)lates, the second very large. 
Femoral pores large and distinct. First phalanx of hind leg extended 
reaches angle of jaw. Color dark gray, maculated with dark brown 
circular spots, each having a lighter center. Anterior to the lower 
extremities the spots become rhomboid in shape, ami on the tail are 
oval. The head is densely and minutely punctulated with black spots. 
Belly white. This si)ecies is to be compared with G. wislizeni, from 
which it differs in certain particulars, the coloration being entirely dif- 
ferent from any of the known species of Crotaphytus.

Sceloporus rufidorsum, sp. nov. 

This beautiful and characteristic species was discovered at San Quen- 
tin Bay, California, by Mr. L. Belding, who has forwarded other speci- 
mens of it from La Paz and Cerros Island. 

Description. — Scales of dorsal region strongly earinated, as large 
as those of 8. clarJci zoste romus, in twelve rows between insertion of 
upper extremites. Abdominal scales smaller than labials. Cephalic 
shields not earinated, but slightly tuberculated. Prefrontal broader 
than long. Superoculars in three series, not in immediate contact with 
the superciliary series. Abdominal scales finely denticulate. Scale of 
base of tail larger than upon any other part of the body. Femoral pores 



specimens gradually fades towards the lateral region, and which in others 
is confined to three scales in width. Posterior to the upper border of the 
auditory orifice a light yellow line is seen, which extends seven scales 
backwards, and turns downwards at a right angle, continuing until the 
shoulder is reached; anterior to this, and in the angular space thus 
formed, is a patch of deep indigo blue. Sides of body and abdomen 
same color, many of the scales being spotted with malachite green. 
This color terminates abruptly at the line of femoral pores. Tail bluish 
brown above, bluish white beneath. This species is to be compared 
with >S'. clarJci zosteromns, from which it differs principally in coloration.

Phrynosoma douglassi pygmaea, sub^p. nov. 

Ill 1878 Mr. H. W. Hensbaw forwarded to the National Museum, 
from the vicinity of Des Chutes River, Oregon, a number of horned 
lizards, which, though adults, are smaller than any know n species of 
Phrynosoma. In 1881 Capt. Chas. Bendire, U. S. A., forwarded from 
Fort Walla Walla, Wash, Ter., the same species. A number of spec- 
imens have been found in the National Museum collection of reptiles 
from Fort Steilacoom. While resembling P. douglassi in many partic- 
ulars, still there are many dissimilar characters, and the name is pro- 
posed as given above. Head more elongated and less flat above than 
in P. douglassi, superciliary ridges more strongly marked. Occipital 
and temporal spines, considering size, more acute and longer. 

Body almost circular when viewed from above, not so long as in P. 
douglassi; limbs small in proportion to size, hind limbs extended, almost 
reaching axilla. Inframaxillaiy series of scales eight in number, not 
nine as in P. douglassi, separated from lower labials by two rows of 
subcircular scales, in each of which a well developed pore may be seen. 
Femoral pores very minute. 

Color above dark gray, with a double series of six black blotches, 
posteriorly margined with light gray. Chin and upper portion of breast 
minutely punctulated with black. The largest specimen, number 10918, 
from Fort Walla Walla,is from tip of tail to end of nose 3-^^ inches in 
length, IJ inches in width across belly.

CONTRIBUTIOIV TO THE MIOCENE FT.ORA OF AliASKA. 

By L. I^ESqUEREUX. 

The Miocene flora of Alaska is partly known by a memoir of Heer, 
pubhshed in the second volume of his Arctic Flora. The memoir was 
prepared from specimens collected by M. Furuhjelin, of Helsingfors, 
Finland, partly in the island of Kuiu, in the vicinity of Sitka, partly at 
Cook's Inlet, near the peninsula of Aliaska. The plants described by 
Heer, representing 56 species, are of marked interest by their intimate 
relation with those of Atane, in Greenland, on one side, and with those 
of Carbon, in Wyoming and of the Bad Lands in Nevada, on the other. 
They compose a small group which supplies an intermediate point of

comparison for considering the marchof the vegetation during the Mio- 
cene period from the jjolar circle to the middle of the North American 
continent, or from the thirty-fifth or fortieth to the eightieth degree of 
latitude. The remarkable affinity of the Miocene types, in their distri- 
bution from Spitzbergen and Greenland to the middle of Europe, had 
already been manifested by the celebrated works of Heer. But the 
Alaska flora has for this continent the great advantage of exposing, in 
the Miocene period, the i)redominance of vegetable types which have 
continued to our time and are still present in the vegetation of this con- 
tinent. 

To what was known until now of the Alaska flora a valuable addition 
has been procured by the collections made for the Smithsonian Insti- 
tution by Dr. W. H. Dall, of the Coast Survey. A large number of 
finely preserved specimens of fossil plants were procured from Alaska 
and its vicinity — Coal Harbor, Uuga Island, Shumagins (south side of 
Aliaska); Chugachik Bay, Cook's Inlet; and Chignik Bay, Aliaska 
Peninsula. In this valuable collection, which was intrusted to me for 
examination, I have found a number of species, already described by 
Heer, from Alaska, a few others described already from the Miocene of 
Greenland or of Europe, but not yet known from Alaska, and some 
new species. These last are described below with the enumeration of 
those described already, but not yet known in the flora of Alaska. 

DESCRIPTION AND ENUMERATION OF SPECIES. 
CEYPTOGAME.E. 

Equisetace^. 

JEquisetum glohulosum, sp. nov. 

Ehizoma slender, thinly lineate, flexuous or rigid, distantly articulate, 
bearing simple oi)posite globular tubercles, more or less wrinkled by 
compression. 

The branches from 1 to 6"'"' in diameter, irregularly striate, straight, or 
flexuous, distantly articulate, bear at the articulations, simple opposite, 
globular appendages somewhat like those of Pliysagenia Parlatorii 
Heer (Fl. tert. Helv. 1, p. 109, pi. XLII, figs. 2-17), but globular and gen- 
erally" simple, very rarely appendiculate in two. These remains are 
much decomposed by nmceration, and fragmentary, none of them con- 
tinuous, and all without trace of sheath. 

FiLICES. 

Osmunda Torelli Heer, Mioc. El. of Sakhalin, p. 19, pi. 1, f. 4, 4b. 

Fecopteris Torelli Heer, Fl. Arct., 1, p. 88, pi. 1, f. 15. 

HemUeUtes Torelli Heer, ibid., II, p. 4G2, pi. xl, figs. 1-5 a; Iv. f. 2. 

This species is represented by a very large number of specimens, 
mostly separate leaflets embedded in bowlders of carbonate of iron. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 445 

Most of the leaflets are simple, uot lobate, oblong or ovate lanceolate, 
entire or merely crenulate on the borders by the impressions of the 
veins. These leaflets are rarely preserved entire ; the borders are often 
lacerated ; they vary from 3J to G«'" long and 1 to 2^'='" broad. They 
e\idently represent leaflets of an Osmiinda. 
Hah. — Coal Harbor, Unga Island. 

COXIFERiE. 

Thuites {Ghamcecyparis) Alaslcensis, sp. nov. 

Branchlets alternate, flattened, oblique ; leaves imbricate on four 
ranks, the facial squamiform compressed, broadly rhomboidal quadrate, 
slightly narrowed to the base, inflated on the borders and in the middle 
toward the apex ; the lateral flattened by compression, exposing half 
their face, and thus triangular, exactly filling the space between the 
base and the top of the facial leaves, all thick. 

I find no distinct relation for this plant except with Thuites Meriani 
Heer. Fl. Arct., Ill, p. 73, pi, XVI, figs. 17, 18, a cretaceous species dif- 
fering by the facial leaves ovate, narrower towards the apex. 

Hah. — Same as the preceding. 

3IYRIGACEJE. 

Comptonia cuspidata, sp. nov. 

Leaves long, linear or very gradually tapering upwards to a terminal 
narrowly elliptical lobe, pointed or apiculate by the excurrent medial 
nerve, pinnately lobed; lobes coriaceous, convex, subalternate, free at 
base, irregularly trapezoidal or obliquely oblong, inclined upwards and 
sharply acute or cuspidate f primary nerves two, or three in the largest 
lobes, oblique, the upper curving in ascending to the acumen and branch- 
ing outside, the lower parallel and curving along the borders, anasto- 
mosing with branches of the superior ones, generally separated by simi^le 
secondary short nerves. 

Comparable to Comptonia acutiloha Brgt. and other European Tertiary 
species of this group, but distinct from all by the large cuspidate lobes 
turned upwards, &c. 

Hal). — Same as the preceding. 

Comptonia prcemissa, sp. nov. 

Leaves long, linear in their whole length, 5 to lO'^"^ long, 12 to ]5™"i 
broad; deeply equally pinnate-lobate; lobes very obtuse or half round 
cut to the middle and slightly decurring in their point of connection, the 
terminal very obtuse; nervation obsolete, substance somewhat thick but 
not coriaceous. 

The species has its greatest afiQnity to the living Comptonia aspleni- 
folia Ait. It also appears related to C. rotundata Wat., as described by 
Schimper, Pal. veget., II, p. 555, a species known to me only by its 
description. 

Hal). — Chignik Bay, Aliaska. 



4i6 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Betulace^. 
Betula AlasTcana, sp. nov. 

Leaves small, round iu outline, rounded or truncate at base, deeply 
obtusely dentate all around, except at the biise, turned back or recurved 
on a short petiole; medial nerve distinct, the lateral obsolete ; catkins 
short, cvlindrical, oblong or slightly inflated, in the middle erect. 

Except that no glands are perceivable upon the stems, this species 
agrees in all its characters with Betula glanditlosa, Michx. of Oregon. I 
consider it as identical. 

Hab. — Chignik Bay, Aliaska. 

Alnus corylifoUaj sp. nov. 

Leaves large, broadly ovate, rounded or cordate at base, acuminate 
or narrowly oblong-ovate, doubly dentate on the borders, primary teetli 
large, distant more or less sharply denticulate on the back, secondary 
nerves oblique, parallel, the lower pairs more open, all generally sim- 
ple, except a few thin tertiary branches near the borders, passing to the 
points of the teeth -, surftice smooth ; tibrilles rarely distinct 5 petiole 
comparatively long. 

Kesembles Corylus M, Quarnji Heer, differing by the smooth surface, 
the nervilles obsolete, the nerves not branching, the long petiole, &c. 

Hah. — Chugachik Bay, Cook's Inlet, Alaska. 

CUPULIFER^. 

Carpinns grandis, Ung. 

In numerous specimens. 

Mab.—^ame as the preceding. Described also from Greenland by 
Heer. 

Fagus Deucalionis Ung. 

The collection has a single specimen of this species. Heer has de- 
scribed it from Greenland. 

Hab. — With the preceding. 

Quercus Dallii, sp. nov. 

Leaves subcoriaceous, oblong-lanceolate, acuminate, rounded or sub- 
cordate at base, 6 to 12cm iQ^g^ 4 to 8'='^ broad, deeply equally undulate 
or obtusely dentate; lower lateral nerves nearly in right angle, branch- 
ing, the others oblique, generally simple, all craspedodrome. 

The secondary nerves are more or less distant according to the size of 
the leaves, being generally 14 pairs. 

The relation of this species is to both Q. Groenlandica and Q. Olafseni 
Heer, two species from Greenland, from which this one especially differs 
by the rounded orsubcordate base and the lower nerves nearly in right 
angle. Except that the leaves are much larger, they may also be com-

Ulmace m. 

Ulmus sorbifoUa TJng., Schossnitz, Fl., p. 30, PI. XIV, fig. 10. 

Leaf oblong, with borders parallel in the middle; taper pointed or 
acuminate ; secondary nerves numerous, close, parallel, half open (angle 
of divergence 60°), generally forking near the doubly deutate-crenate 
borders ; primary teeth blunt, turned upwards. 

The base of the leaf is destroyed. The preserved part is 4^^'" long, 
2*=™ broad, with 18 pairs of deeply marked secondary veins. 

The species, which is not mentioned in Schimper's Veget. Paleont., is 
closely allied to U. plurinervia Ung., which has been found in Alaska.

Nyssaceje. 

Nyssa arctica? Heer., Fl. Arct., II, p. 477, PI. XLII, fig. 12 c; L. figs.

The fruit which I refer to this species is of the same size and form as 
fig. 6, I. c, but less distinctly striate lengthwise ; the cross-wrinkles 
slightly marked by Heer, in fig. 6 b. (enlarged), being as prominent as 
the longitudinal strife. The fruit somewhat deteriorated by maceration 
most probably represents the same species abundantly found in Green- 
land.

Biospijros anceps Heer., Fl. Tert. Helv. Ill, p. 12, PI. CII, figs. 15-18;

The leaves agree by all the characters with Heer's species especially 
similar to figs. 16, 17 of Fl. Helv. I. c, the smaller leaf being of the same 
size as fig. 16. The other specimen, which is fragmentary, is much like 
fig. 7 of the Siberian Fl. The leaves are broader than in D. Alaslcana; 
the lateral nerves more distant, &c. 

5flj._Cook's Inlet. 

Ericint}^. 

Vaccinium reticulatum, Al. Br., Heer., Fl. tert. Helv., Ill, p. 10, PL CI, 

fig. 30. 

Leaves petiolate, oval, very entire, obtuse at the apex, narrowed at 
the base in rounding to a short alate petiole ; lateral nerves open, few, 
interspersed with tertiary shorter ones ; surface deeply reticulate. 

The leaves from their size, shape, and nervation corresjtond with those 
described by Heer, I. c, the only difference being that one of the leaves 
I had for examination, the largest, has the short petiole alate. In fig. 
30 of Heer, the petiole seems also bordered in the upper part by the 
decurrent base of the leaf, but the appearance is less distinct. More- 
over, there are other leaves in the same collection of Mr. Dall which are 
smaller and with naked petiole. The difference is not therefore of 
specific value. 

Eab. — Cook's Inlet.

Cornus orhifera Heer., IJ. S. Geol. Eep., VII, p. 243. 

The specimen referable to this species has the lateral nerves curving 
inward along the borders, anastomosing with the upper ones by nervilles 
in right angles, as in Heer, Fl. tert. Helv., pi. C V, fig. 16. Heer has also 
described the species from Si)itzbergen specimens.

auriculate at base; secondary nerves distant, curved in traversing the 
blade, forking near the borders. 

From the numerous well preserved specimens of this beautiful spe- 
cies, I have been able to complete the diagnosis of Heer, made from too 
fragmentary leaves. The leaves are longer than those of M. oralis, 
Lesqx., to which Heer compares this species, and also subauriculate at 
base or emarginate ; the surface is rugose, crossed in right angles to the

By 1LEONE1AE2D STEJNEGER. 

The group here under consideration, the so-called "family" Turdida'* 
has given much trouble to those authors who have tried to arrange the 
genera naturally, and to define their limits distinctly. I do not intend 
to give here an analysis of their different essays, but as the last, viz, 
Mr. Seebohm's in the fifth volume of the "Catalogue of Birds in the 
British Museum," is very radical and opposed to commonly accepted 

* I am Dot at all conviucetl that tbe groups of the Passercs, generally called lauiilies, 
are really equivalent to the family groups of the other orders of birds or other verte- 
hrates ; but as I am, for the present, unable to take up this question, I have con- 
tented myself with the generally adopted nomenclature.

views, I cannot pass it by in silence, inasniucb as Mic present study may 
be regarded as a reaction, provoked by the arrangement proposed in 
the above mentioned work. 

It may then be proper to state first, that the definition of the group 
Turdidcv (=Seebohm's Turdincc), given by Mr. Seebohm, seems to be a 
very proper one, and I think he has therein exi)ressed the only chief 
character which really indicates the relationship of the birds to be in- 
cluded in this family. The peculiar spotted first plumage of the Tur- 
(lid(e is a very striking feature, and its coincidence with booted tarsi very 
remarkable. A careful comparison with forms, which, without showing 
those characters, have at different times been referred to the Turdida', 
will convince us that the limits traced by Mr. Seebohm are the only re- 
hable ones, and that the family thus defined is a very natural group,^ 
and, indeed, one of the best among the Fasserca. It is only to be re- 
gretted that Mr. Seebohm did not include a few other forms which have 
the same peculiarities. I may especially allude to the 31yadestincc, the- 
position of whicsh will be discussed in lull below\ His concluding re- 
marks on page 2 seem, however, to indicate that he himself has been 
aware of this fault. 

It is not difficult to foresee that his definition of the family will be 
heartily accepted by ornithologists, but it is, on the other hand, prob- 
able that his peculiar generic arrangement will meet common opposi- 
tion. 

Mr. Seebohm states {p. viii) that he has "been obliged to fiill back 
upon color or pattern of color as the only character which indicates 
near relationship." 

To see how he has carried this out, let us first take his genus Geo- 
cichla^ of which he says (p. 148), that it "on the whole must be consid- 
ered one of the best defined of the family Turdida'.^^ One needs only to 
compare his plates X and XI in order to be convinced that he does not 
mean the general coloration of the bird, as the two plates represent birds, 
the general coloration of which is, at least, as different as that of a Itobiu 
and a Rock-Thrush, which he refers to different genera. The diagnosis 
of the genus shows, also, that special imiiortance is attached only to the 
pattern of the under surface of the wing, these birds "having the outside 
web of all the secondaries and of many of the primaries white, occasion- 
ally tinted with bufi', but abruptly defined from the brown ot the rest of 
the quills," and the "axillaries parti-colored, the basal half being white 
and the terniinal half black, slate gray, or brown. Most of the wing- 
coverts are similarly parti-colored, but the relative iiosition of the colors 
is reversed, the white i)ortion being on the terminal half." But these 
characters do not hold good in all species, as Mr. Seebohm himself in- 
dicates. There are several excejitions, or, as he calls them, "aberrant 
species," which have the "axillaries and under wing-coverts uniform in 
color," and there are several species which he refers to other genera, 



PROCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 451 

but which possess the above characters at least as well determined as 
his "aberrant" Geocichhe. 

Thus, besides the cases mentioned by Mr. Seebohm himself, '■'Turdus^' 
pallasii has the light color ou the inner web "very abruptly defined;" 
his Turdus albiventer likewise has "the pale portions of the inner webs 
of the quills greatly developed and very abruptly defined," and so 
further on. But he gives no characters by which these aberrant 
species (aberrant of both genera) may be distinguished, and he also 
gives no reason why he places these aberrant forms in different genera. 
It would be interesting to know why Turdus albiventer is not as good a 
Oeocichla as G. sinensis, when the pattern of coloration is the only 
character which has generic value; or, in other words, why he does 
not place G. sinensis in another genus. May there not, perhaps, be 
other characters of more importa4ice and generic value, and which indi- 
cate a nearer relationship than the coloration? But one ought not to 
suspect that, as Mr. Seebohm, in another place, retains a species in the 
genus Cafharus, for the reason that its " general style of coloration" so 
closely resembles the other species of that genus, although it "is a 
typical JSrithacus so ftir as what are called structural characters are 
concerned." Here, again, "the general style of coloration" is the only 
generic character of v^alue! In the one genus it thus apparently has 
no value at all, while in the other it is the only important one! It is 
curious to see that Mr. Seebohm, when neither pattern nor general 
style of coloration is sufficient to sepaitite two genera, hastily takes 
refuge in a structural character; for example, p. 362, and p. 334, and 
especially the "Key," p. 146, d'", e"',J"', and //'". Curiously enough, 
he separates two genera, in either of which several species are simply 
inseparable as to general style and pattern of coloration from certain 
ones of the other genus, and j^et such similarly colored species, he says, 
are typical members of the other genus, so far as structural characters 
are concerned! How, then, will ]\Tr. Seebohm tell Catharns graciliros- 
tris or occidentalis from " Erithacus " luscinia and pJiilomela ? In colora- 
tion C occidentalis and E. luscinia agree so closely that it would be 
very difficult to sei)arate them even specifically, if we had no structural 
characters, and he expressly makes the statement that (7. gracilirostris 
is, as to structure, a typical Erithacus. We will attempt, by his " Key," 
to unravel this intricate question. In this the distinctive marks of each 
genus are given as follows: 
a'". General color ofuiuler parts slate gray, shading only into brown 

or white. Legs never black 5. Catharus. 

h'". Throat generally brilliant in color and frequently in violent con- 
trast to the cheeks ; if not, legs pale 6. Erithacus. 

Unfortunately, the "key" is of no use; both the species of Catharus 
and Erithacus mentioned above have not a brilliant colored throat; and 
further, the legs are in both pale, and never black. If no structural 
differences are to be found, the separation of the two genera would, in 



452 PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

spite of Mr. Seebolim's .statement, be hopeless ; but, luckily, they may 
be distinguished by very recoguizable and distinct characters; the dif- 
ferent construction of the wing-, in particular, rendering their separation 
easy. 

A further examination of the birds included in the genus Geocichla 
shows that in several species the sexes are alike, while in others they 
are very differently colored ; but it seems that Mr. Seebohm attaches 
no importance to this as a character of generic value. We cannot but 
indorse this view, being much surprised, however, to lind that he makes 
this difference in coloration between the two sexes the chief, not to say 
the only, distinctive mark of the genera Turdus and Merula; in some 
instances carried out to the utmost, while on the other hand several 
species are included in Merula which have the sexes colored alike, and 
other species showing not unimportant differences between male and 
female are placed within the genus Turdus. In the one case the char- 
acter is the only valuable one; in the other, again, it has no value at all! 

Having adopted the singular theory that structural characters did 
not indicate natural relationship, while pattern of coloration was suffi- 
cient for the purpose, the author has given us a right to expect as the 
result of his investigations a more natural arrangement than any pre- 
ceding it. Unfortunately, howcAer, it must be said that he has not 
succeeded therein, for his own theory is so often and so violently ignored 
that most of his genera are quite void of definite limits. 

It is hardly likely that any«one, be he ever so deeply enamored with 
the coloration theory, will consider it as according with natural affini- 
ties to arrange T. 7ummis^ u-ardii,pinicola, and sihiricus together in one, 
and T. maranonicus, dryas, and inlaris in another subgeneric group, 
when, at the same time, such birds as T. inJaris and torquatus were sep- 
arated geiierically. And as the natural relationshii> in these cases has 
been violated, so also have they in many others. 

It being thus evident that the new mode of defining the genera does 
not lead to a more natural system than the rejected structural charac- 
ters, it is to be doubly deplored that the generic groups resulting from 
its application are so indefinite and their limits so unstable, that IVlr. 
Seebohm (p. 14) needs to appeal to "the instinct of the ornitholog- 
ical student," when he has not been "able to define the character of 
each genus." This instinct may in most cases be sufficient to "tell a 
Chat from a Redstart," but certainly it will be of no use when he shall 
separate a Turdus Seeb. from a Merula of the same author. The exam- 
l»le of Mr. Seebohm himself proves that this instinct is often misleading. 

The (coloration and the pattern of coloration may, in many cases, be of 
very great value as indicating the relationship, but used as a distinctive 
mark for defining genera in the manner of Mr. Seebohm, who often 
only takes in consideration the colors of the male, it seems to me to 
have no scientific value at all. 

It is an objection against the theory of coloration that in many genera 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 453 

of birds some species, in their colors, only represent the immature or 
young state of another species. And as the young and the old birds 
are frequently verj^ unlike in their coloration, the species thus conse- 
quently also look very unlike in their various stages. They may, how- 
ever, be very closely allied, and often more so, than very simihirly 
colored species. This objection applies also to the matter here under 
consideration. The first species of Turdus, which Mr. Seebohm gives, 
is maranonicus Tacz., from South America. As I have had no oppor- 
tunity to examine a specimen of this bird, I must content myself with 
the figure {Proc. Zool. ^oc. Lond., 1880, pi. xx). At first sight I was 
inclined to indorse the view of Mr. Seebohm, and was much perplexed 
to find a Turdus in South America. But, examining the structural char- 
acters given in the description, I soon became convinced that the species 
must belong to Merula. I had not to wait a long time before I obtained, 
to my satisfaction, an interesting proof that this opinion was correct. 
The same day Mr. Eobert Eidgway called my attention to the pi. Ixxv. 
of Sclater and Salvin's "Exotic Ornithology," and pi. xxix. in Froc. 
Zool. Soc. Lond.^ 1867, representing the young Turdus pJucopygus Cab. 
A comparison with the young bird on Taczanowski's plate shows that 
these birds are very closely allied and never should be placed in differ- 
ent, even subgeneric, groups. Merula maranonica (Tacz.) is evidently 
an immature bird,* which, perhaps, may later take a plumage more 
resembling that of the adnlt phwopyfjus, but I should not be surprised 
at all if future investigations would prove that it retains the immature- 
looking plumage also in the adult state. Its place near 21. pliKopiiyns 
must, however, be the same in both cases. 

There is another work having a very important bearing on the sub- 
ject to which it is necessary to refer in any dissertation on the arrange- 
ment of the American Thrushes, namely', Prof. S. F. Baird's "Eeview 
of American Birds." Written sixteen to eighteen years ago it is still 
the best treatment of the subject extant, and the views exin^essed 
therein vindicate their i)lace above more recent essays. And I am glad 
to say that if I have succeeded in the following arrangement it is due 
to the most valuable hints which the work above mentioned contains. 

As to the limits of the family, I have already remarked that I chiefly 
agree with Mr. Seebohm. It will, therefore, be perceived that I do not 
admit the Mimincc^ which Professor Baird in 1804 placed as a sub- 
family with the Turdidcv. It seems to me that their proper place is 
near the Wrens, among which they also had been included by him in 
his work on the Birds of North America (1858). In fact the Mocking- 
birds are so closely allied to the Troglodytidte that I am inclined to 
believe that the most natural arrangement would be to include them as 
a subfamily along with the TroglodytinK within the same family. 

* I liiive it ou Mr. Lawrence's authority, that Mr. Sclater has determinefl T. luara- 
novicus to be the young of T. nigrlcrps, Jelski, Dr. Stejneger's prediction Ijeing thus

The genus Ckhlhermima Bp. lias especially been regarded as an in- 
termediate link between Tbruslies and Mocking-birds. In 1854 Bona- 
parte divided tbe genus and made C.fuscata the type of tbe genus Cich- 
lalopia, wbicb name as untenable bas been changed by Mr. Sclater into 
Margarops. Unfortunately, however, this separation later has been 
given up,* because tbe restricted genus Cichlherminia (type herminieri 
Lafr.) unquestionably belongs to the true Thrushes, group MeruJea;, 
while on the other hand the genus Margarops (including fuscata, den- 
sirostris, and montana) as undoubtedly belongs to the Miminw. (See 
ligs. on pages 457 and 470.) By separating and placing these genera in 
this manner, the limits between Turdidw and Mimincv become very tren- 
chant, and the arrangement of the families more natural. 

Later investigations have confirmed the doubts expressed by Profes- 
sor Baird (Rev. p. 410) about the validity of the family Saxicolidw. Dr. 
Cones in his "Birds of the Colorado Valley" (1878), p. 70, still retains 
the term, but at the same time he very frankly confesses : " Eecognitiou 
of the family tSaxicoUdcc is purely a conventional matter, in which most 
ornithologists tacitly agree to follow each other upon no better ground 
than that of precedent." Mr. Seebohm {I. c.) includes the genera Saxi- 
cola and Sialia among the Tiirdimc. In fact, the SaxicoUdw are so 
closely allied to the Thrusbes that they only can claim recognition as 
a special group within the same subfamily. Moreover, I have distin- 
guished as a separate group the Sialiecc, which have formerly been 
united with the Saxicolea-, but whicb certainly differ more from the 
Chats than from the Thrushes. The fact that I have found it necessary 
to unite witb the Bluebirds a species which hitherto has been regarded 
as a Turdus,\ shows where their true relations are to be found; the 
shape of their legs, tail, bill, their habits, and coloration prohibit their 
position within the same group as the Chats, showing the necessity of 
establishing for them a separate group, coequal to tbe groups occupied 
by the Thrusbes and the Chats. Besides, the grouj) Saxicolcw, which only 
embraces one American species, viz, Saxicola oenanthe, by removing the 
Bluebirds becomes more natural and homogeneous, including, as I now 
believe, Saxicola, PrafincoJa, RuticiUa, etc. I cannot agree with tbe 
authors of the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum, who keep the 
genus Fratincola within the family Muscicdpida' (vol. iv, p. 178), altbough 
it, on the other hand, may be regarded as a well-defined genus in con- 
tradistinction to the statement of Mr. R. Collett. (Chr. Vid. Selsk. Forh., 
1881, No. 10, p. 3.) 

It will be seen that the following arrangement differs from that of 
most systematists in separating Turdus merula and its allies as a group, 
Meruh(v, distinct from and coequal to the Turdew and Zusciniece, and in

inckidiug- with tbe latter group the genus Cafharus, which usually has 
been placed among the Thrushes. 

At lirst sight it would seem that the Merulecv and Turdecv are too 
closely related to constitute separate groups, the more so as there are 
lew authors who distinguish the species of the two groups even gener- 
ically. But the trouble of the prior attempts has been that the limit 
between the two groups has been so traced that each division has con- 
tained species really belonging to the other group. Thus, the Turdus 
torquatus has almost unanimously* been regarded as a true Merula, 
closely allied to the type of this genus, only because its color is black. 
A careful examination shows, however, that the Eing-Ouzel, so far from 
being au ally of Merida nigral is a near relative of Turdus viscivorus, the 
type of the restricted genus Turdus. It is, then, a matter of course that 
it has been imT)ossible to separate satisfactorily the two groups even 
generically or subgenerically. But if all heterogeneous elements be 
removed and put in their proper places, the differences between Turdece 
and Meruhc become very striking. In fact, the Mernla nigra is at least 
as remote from the true Thrushes as is Erithacus rnbecida, and the adop- 
tion of the group Lusciniecv (by most ornithologists admitted as family 
or subfamily on the same reasons as the Sa.vicoUdw) therefore necessi- 
tates the establishment of a coordinate group embracing the genus most 
nearly allied to Merida. 

As has already been remarked, the genus Catharus will usually be 
found placed very near the true Thrushes, especially to the smaller 
North American species of the genus Hylocichla, and Mr. Seebohm goes 
even so far as to include Catharus dry as within the same subgeneric; 
groups, embracing Hylocichla musica, mustelitia, Turdus riscivorus and 
pilaris, chiefly, or rather only, on account of the dark spots on the under 
surface. I have found it, however, quite impossible to remove them 
from tbe Lusciniea] (genus Erithacus, Seebohm), with which they agree 
in the very imjjortant character of the structure of bill, wing, and legs, 
and also in tbe colors of the i)lumage. ^Notwithstanding the Cathari 
point towards the true Turdew, while many of the old world Lusciniew 
show a similar tendency towards the Merulea', so that the proper place 
of the group Luseiniew will be between those two, thus fairl}- illustrat- 
ing the gap between Turdcw and Merulew. 

In 186G Professor Baird (o/^. cit. p. 417) established the subfamily 
Myiadestincv in the following words: "I am decidedly of opinion that, 
notwithstanding a, close resemblance in general appearance, Mytadestes 



* The only iiotewortliy excevtiou isProf. J. Cabanis, who, in his " Jouru. fur Oniith." 
1860, p. 161, foot-note, says: " Turdus torqtiatus should not be placed with Aleriila, but 
must, with respect to the shape of bill and wing, remain with Turdus." 

I find no better place for correcting a very curious mistake in Gray's Handbook of 
Birds, i, p. 253, in which the subgenus h of genus Turdus has received the name "Pso- 
plwcichla, Heraug. 1860." The memoir of Cabanis, quoted above, has the heading,

Thrushes, Psoplionchla. By the editor, and hence the error.

and CicMopsis sliould be removed from their usual association with 
Ftilogoni/s, among AnipeUdw, to, or at least very near, the Ttirdklw^ and 
•form a subfamily with Platyeichla. The latter genus is so closely related 
to Oichlopsls as ahnost to be the same; Platyeichla forming the link with 
Turdince through Planesticus, while such species as Myiadestcs unicolor 
show tbe affinities of Cichlopsis to Myiadestes.^^ But so far as I can 
detect, Dr. Elliott Coues is the only author who, in his " Birds of the 
Colorado Valley" (1878), has adopted the view of Professor Baird, in- 
cluding the subfamily Myiadestinw witbni the family Turdidw. I have 
been much surprised to find those birds excluded by Mr. Seebohm, who 
has so nicely pointed out the value of the spotted plumage of the 
young Turdidw, and of the coincidence of this character with smooth 
tarsi, and on the other hand to find them treated by Mr. Sharpe under 
the Timeliidcv.* Thd essential character of this latter group is their 
short and concave wing. But it is evident that the wing of the Mya- 
destincc does not in any respect differ from the structure of the wing of 
the Turdinoe, being rather longer than the average of the latter group, 
and as flat and straight. The relationship between the Meridw of the 
true Thrushes, and the Plafycichlece of the "Fly catching Thrushes" 
(Coues) is so close, indeed, that several species, which really belong to 
the latter group, are usually found — also in the new ^' Catalogue of the 
Birds in the British Museum" — included in one of the genera compos- 
ing the former division. 

The earlier placing of these birds within the AmpeUda' is only due to 
their " resemblance in general ai)pearance," and the differences have 
already been pointed out so exhaustively by Professor Baird, that it is 
unnecessary to repeat them here. The group will not, however, be 
naturally limited or clearly defined without removing the species Mya- 
destcs Icucolis (Tschudi), which is widely different, from the Myadesfinoe, 
beiiig a true member of the Ptiloyonatidoe. As its characters do not 
agree with those of any other genus, it will be necessary to make it the 
tjpe of a new gen us. t 

It will be seen that in the following arrangement I have attached 
much importance to Ihe form of the wing. It is certainly' true, that in 
the Passeres, the more pointed wings very, often indicate migratorial 

*As to the latter, it is {iroper to state that he himself is not content with the place

mind. * * » Mr. Seebohm has not admitted them into his volume of the 'Cata- 
logue.' I have, therefore, i)laced them near the Mockiug-Thrushes, which they

liabits, while the more rounded wings are oftener found in stationary 
birds. This fact, however, does not in any way diminish the value of 
the structural diiference as a distinguishing mark, the purpose of which 
is to indicate the limits of the different generaj nor is it without impor- 
tance in indicating the affinities of the ditferent forms. In so far as it 
is connected with the migratory habits of certain species, it j)robably 
signifies the simultaneous immigration of those birds into the region to 
which they now belong, and indicates thus a geographical separation 
which, during the course of time, cannot have been without influence on 
their development. 

That the more or less rounded or pointed form of the wing has not 
such an essential importance in regard to the migratorial phenomenon 
is evident from the general consideration, that not all migratory birds 
have long and pointed wings. It is also to be remarked, that in general 
the same species is migratory in some localities, while in other places 
it is stationary. Finally, we have in the group of birds here under con- 
sideration ample opportunity for showing instances which i)oint to quite 
the opposite direction. So. for example, has Ridgicayia pinicola — which 
certainly is not a migratory bird, and the geograj)hical range of which 
is remarkably restricted very pointed wings, with the 3d and 4th 
quills longest, and very short secondaries. We have also the genus 
Sialia, with its unusually lengthened and pointed wings. 

On the other hand, the length of the secondaries and of the primary 
coverts seems to be of very great importance. Kor is their length in 
any way directly dependent upon the migratory or stationary habits of 
the birds, though it may certainly be admitted that longer secondaries

at base; nostrils large, rounded, much exjjosed; frontal feathers not reaching by far 
to the posterior margin. Tarsus scutellate anteriorly, as long as middle toe and claw. 




Myiadestes Icvcotis, Cab. 

Professor Baird states that the tarsus is " without distinct scutellar divisions* ante, 
riorly except below," but a close examination shows that there is a well, marked divis- 
ion straight above the upper division of the outer side. The accompanying figure. 
No. 41,908, is also less correct in another respect, showing the nostrils too near the 
feathers of the forehead.

and shorter primary- coverts usually are conuected witli rounded wiugs, 
and vice versa. We may also find many instances which prove that 
such a law for the construction of the wing does not exist. 

Considering the great importance of the number of the primaries of 
the Oscines, aud the deep-seated affinities expressed by the characteristic 
position of the middle wiug-coverts, it is difficult to escape the impres- 
sion that the construction of the wing is of especial importance in 
determining the relationships of the highest organized birds. As this 
difference in the construction usually consists in different development 
of one part in relation to, others, it generally becomes a character rather 
easily expressed in words and represented by figures; thus being of 
great advantage to those who try to fix the limits of the different groups 
by means of structural characters. 

It will be unnecessary to point out the impossibility of expressing 
all the manifold and intricate relationships of the genera by arranging 
them in a straight line. It is, consequently, a matter ot course that the 
succession of the genera in the following synopsis expresses only to a 
certain degree their mutual relations. It may also be considered that 
the omission of the PahTeogean forms makes the series incomplete. At 
first it was my intention to give a diagram showing the affinities, but, in 
view of the imperfectness of such an attempt, without including all old- 
world genera in addition to the American ones, I have thought it better 
to put it off" to a later time. 

On the other hand, the characters of the sections and genera given 
below are intended to embrace all forms belonging to them, and not 
only those occurring in America. If I have not always succeeded 
herein it is partly due to the relatively scarce material, which repre- 
sents only a fraction of the extra- American birds. 

As to the noinenclature and the manner of quotation, I only refer to 
my remarks in my paper, in Proceedings of the U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 5, 
1882, p. 29. It will be seen that examples strengthening the views there 
expressed are to be easily found in the present memoir. As a very 
striking one, I refer to the foot-note given under Myadestes, showing 
the character and the uselessness of phdological "emendations" in 
ornithological nomenclature. 

Before concluding these remarks, I take the opportunity of thanking 
mj' friend Kobert liidgway for his most valual)le assistance, without 
which I should never have attempted the following essay. 

I have also to acknowledge my indebtedness to the authorities of the 
Smithsonian Institution and United States National Museum for the 
opportunity of examining the collections upon which this paper is 
largely based.

somewhat lengtheued, the terminal joint especially so. Tail double 
rounded, the two outermost feathers being- much shorter than the others. 

Eemarks. — This genus embraces only one known species, the range 
of which is very restricted, being found only in the high table-land of 
southern Mexico. 

The bird forming the type of the present genus has not been removed 
from the genus Turdus by any author except Mr. Seebohm. The jjlace 
given to it by him within the genus GeocicJila, "subgeneric group ^Hes- 
2)erocic7da',^" is, however, by no means an improvement. GeocicJila and 
the nearest allied forms are exclusively Old World and Australian birds, 
which have no true relatives within the Neogean part of the world, the 
Eesperocidila nwvia being as badly placed among the Ground-Thrushes 
as the bird here under consideration. The main reason of Mr. See- 
bohm for placing the E. pinicola among these birds seems to have been 
the pattern of its wing, although he candidly admits that the pattern 
of the axillaries is not typical. Any one who will take the trouble of 
comparing the bird here under consideration with a young Sialla, will 
soon convince himself that the two genera should not be removed far 
from each other, even if he embraces the doctrine that the coloration is 
the only character of importance in regard to relationship. A close 
comparison of the structural features of both genera corroborates this 
view. The long and pointed wings, the short tail, and the exceedingly 
short tarsi, make the Ridcjwayia widely distant from the Turdem and 
Blerulecc, closely resembling in these respects the Sialia. Besides, it 
will be remarked, that the geographical distribution of the two genera 
agrees very well, thus making the Sialiecv a nicely circumscribed group 
in this respect also. 

From Sialia the Ridgwayia is easily distinguished by the more length- 
ened bill, the short gonys, and the double-rounded tail. Indeed it is 
one of the best defined genera of the whole family.

Smaller size; predominant color blue and chestnut, in the adults un- 
spotted. Wings very long and pointed, with long primaries and short 
secondaries; first primary normally placed, with tendency, however, to 
the same position as in Ridgicayia, very short, not one-fourth the second. 
Bill short, stout, compressed at the tip; commissure with a distinct 
notch, and more or less curved; gonys of ordinary length, so that the 
chin-angle is not produced before the line of the nostrils. Nasal fosste 
filled with bristly feathers, only the openings of the nostrils being ex- 
posed; bristles along gape more or less develox)ed. Tarsi stout and

very short, being about of the same length ns the commissure and the 
middle toe with chiw, only making one-fifth of the length of the wings. 

Toes stout, the middle one not un- 
usually lengthened. Tail moderate; 
slightly forked. 

Remarks. — I have not been able to 
examine an example of Grandahi 
coelicolor Hodgs., which Mr. See- 
bohm includes within this genus. I 
have, however, very strong doubts as 
to the correctness of this arrange- 
ment, which seems mainly based on 
the blue color of the plumage. If the 
figure given by Wolf in Gray and Mitchell's "Genera of Birds" (I, 
1^1. 50, fig. 3) is correct, the Grandala is a widely different genus, char, 
acterized, in contradistinction to Sialia, by the rictal bristles being obso- 
lete, by the lengthened bill, and the exposed openings of the nostrils, 
the fore part of the membrane of which is not covered by feathers, also 
by the scutellated and lengthened tarsi, which are considerably longer 
than the middle toe. Besides, the toes are stated to be slender, and the 
tail to be strongly emarginared. It appears to me that Grandala is 
badly placed even within the same group as Sialia. I cannot think it 
will be impossible to find a more i)roper place near one of the Old World 
forms, although I shall not make any attempt without having examined 
the bird itself.

sure, which has a distinct subterminal notch. The bill is short, broad 
at base, and much depressed. The fore part of the nasal fosste naked, 
and the nostrils never covered by bristles. Tarsus long and slender, 
never shorter than two-sevenths of the wing, and always much longer 
than the commissure ; oi^stretched legs reaching nearly to the tip of 
the tail. 

Eemarks. — This group of smaller Thrushes is, I think, entitled to 
generic rank. Originally intended to embrace the North American 
species, it has later been shown that the Turdus musicus of the Old 
World is a true member of the group. Mr. G. R. Gray (Handb. of Birds, 
i, p. 254), unfortunately, however, at the same time included in it the 
Turdus iliacus, which only comes near to the K. musica in size and 
general appearance, thus embroiling the limits and discrediting the 
validity of the genus. 

Not having seen any specimens, I am unable to decide whether we 
will have to enlist a Hylocichla aurita Verreaux or not. Verreaux's bird 
has been thought to be the eastern representative of the common Euro- 
pean Song Thrush, and if such be really the case it is very likely that 
its proper place is within this genus.

Larger, spotted Thrushes, with wings almost as in the foregoing 
genus. The feathering of the nasal region and the form of the bill are 
also the same, with the exception that the latter is stouter and higher. 
Tarsus stout and of moderate length, never being longer than two- 
eighths of the wing, but longer, however, than the commissure : out- 
stretched legs fall far short of the tip of the tail. 

Remarks. — The genus Turdus thus restricted forms a natural and 
rather well defined group, embracing, besides a few additional species 
from Eastern Asia, the following members of the west Palaearctic oruis: 
T. viscivorus, jpallidus, torquatus, pilaris, ohscurus, iliaciis, atrogularis, 
fuseatus, naumanni, and ruficollis. 

This genus, which is a strictly Palaearctic one, is entitled to admission 
into a synopsis of the American genera only on account of the acci- 
dental occurrence of Turdus iliacus in Greenland.

curved commissure, and inflated tomia ; gonys loug, being longer than 
half the commissure, which only very exceptionally has a subtermiual 

notch. The cov- 
ering of the nasal

a considerable 
number (about 7)

besides, the bristles along the gape are much more developed than in 
other Thrashes. Tarsus stout, of moderate length, shorter than two- 
eighths of the wing, but still longer than the commissure ; outstretched

embraces one species, but 
I see no reason for the 
increasing displeasure at 
genera containing few 
species, as little as I take 
satisfaction in the not un- 
common practice of sub- 
dividing a genus only on 
account of the great num- 
ber of its species. 

The main marks distin- 
guishing this genus from 
HegperoHcManaevia. the Other mcmbcrs of the 

group TurdcK are given above, these characters, indeed, as also the style 
of the coloration, being almost unique in the whole family. It is thought, 
however, that the relationship is rather with the true Thrushes than 
with any other genus. Their remoteness from the other forms is also 
expressed in the restricted geographical distribution of the present bird, 
which only inhabits the Pacific region of North America. 

[Fig. 9814 gives an entirely erroneous view of the nostrils, which is corrected in 
the accompanying figure, in which the sinnation of the outer webs of the primaries 
and the form of the spurious primary are shown also. — R. R.] 

Dr. E. Coues (Birds of the Colorado Valley, I, p. 15), remarks that 
the young is ''like the adult female," and that "no speckled stage, like 
that of the very young liobiu has been observed, though August sped- 




PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 4G1 

meos have been examined." But it is only apparently, what this state- 
ment seems to indicate, that the young is not speckled at all, thus 
differing from all the other members, and wanting the most essential 
character. I have now before me a specimen (U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 45897, 
Sitka, August, 18GG) which differs considerably from the adult female. 
The under surface is of a much duller color, without white on the belly 
and under tail-coverts. All the feathers of the chin, throat, and upper 
breast, with well-marked, blackish edges, giving these parts a scaly ap- 
pearance. In the adult female the feathers forming the collar are almost 
uniformly dark, the edges being lighter, if any, while the feathers of the 
above-mentioned parts of the young bird are gray and downy at their 
basal half, then ochraceous yellow, and, finally, narrowly edged with 
blackish. The feathers of the upper parts in the young have no light 
centers as usually among the Thrushes, except on the sides of the neck 
and on the head, where the middle of the feathers are more or less con- 
spicuously marked with a lighter spot. Finally, we have a very striking 
difference between the adult and the young, showing the common 
Tlirush-like feature of the plumage of the latter, the smaller wing-coverts 
having wedge-shaped, rusty spots towards the tip and dark edgings, 
while in the adult bird they are absolutely uniform in color. It will 
thus be seen that the speckled stage is not altogether wanting in this 
genus, although it may be admitted that it is not so conspicuous as in 
the young Eobin. This fact seems to me to strengthen my view, that 
the present bird, notwithstanding a certain resemblance of the predom- 
inant colors and their tone, is widely remote from Merula migratoria, in 
the neighborhood of which it has been placed by many authors.

Eemarks. — I have not been able to find any important difference be- 
tween the species included within the genus Malacociclila Gould, and 
the typical Cathari. The difference is chiefly and alone to be found in 
the color, the former group having the throat and upper breast spotted, 
somewhat like the smaller species of Hylocichla, with which they, in 
fact, have been put together by Mr. Seebohm. They differ, however, 
widely from these in most respects, being structurally quite identical 
with the other species composing the genus here in queston.

considerably shorter than the wing. 

liEiviARKS. — At the first sight this genus will appear somewhat hete- 
rogeneous, including such diflt'erent looking birds, as Merula nigra, 
migratoria andjamaicensis. These differences are, however, only super- 
ficial and due to the color, but it will not be difficult to arrange the 
numerous species of this genus, which has representatives all the world 
over, but the chief range of which seems to be the tropical regions, iu 
one series, showing nicely the transitions from the deepest black to the 
lightest rusty, and from the quite uniform to the most varied colored 
bird. As to the Jl/. aiirantia (Gmel.), from Jamaica, I have expressed 
my doubts under Semimentla, to which remarks I here refer.

Size large; color uniform blackish or dull brownish. Wing very

and somewhat lengthened, never longer, however, than two and a half 
times the exposed culmen. Tail considerably rounded, the tail-feathers 
more than two and a half times the length of the tarsus, but shorter 
than three and a half times the same length, and decidedly shorter than 
the wing. 

Remarks. — As to which species should be included within this genus, 
authors have had different opinions. So has especially Professor Baird 
included within it the Tardus mirantius Gmel., although it seems that he 
is aware of the incongruity of this species and those which were con- 
sidered typical by the founder of the genus, Mr. Sclater (see Rev. Amer. 
Birds. I, p. 4), and 1 think these birds are too heterogeneous to become 
members of the same genus. T. aurantius will be ver^- difficult to sepa- 
rate from the genus Merida. The bird looks rather peculiar, and will 
probably require a separate genus for itself, although I have not suc- 
ceeded in finding characters sufficient to separate it from the latter 
group, with which, for the present, I have been obliged to keep it. 

Of the species which I have been able to examine, only the following 
belong to the genus Semimerula, restricted and defined as above : Semi- 
merula gigf(s, Semimerula xanthosceles, and Semimerula atrosericea. 

This genus does not occur anywhere else than in South America.

Size larg^e. Plumage spotted and squamated underneath. Wing 
rounded, third, fourth, and fifth primaries being equal and longest; 
second primary about two and a half times the first; secondaries long. 
Bill very large and stout; culmen arched from the base; commissure 
with very distinct subterminal notch, only a little more than twice the 
length of the long gonys. Bristles along gape numerous, and very long 
and strong; on the apexmalaris a tuft of numerous stiff bristles. The 
booted tarsus stout and lengthened, not being, however, more than two 
times the exposed culmen. Tail very slightly rounded and short, so 
that the outstretched legs are reaching nearly to the tip of tail ; tail- 
feathers scarcely more than twice the length of the tarsus, and very 
much shorter than the wing. Below and behind the eye a large naked 
space. 

Eemarks. — As has already been stated, the genus CicJilherminia, re- 
stricted as above, belongs to the Turdidw, whereas the other species, 
generally admitted to it, form a well-defined genus, Margarops Sclat., 
and belong to quite a different family, being characteristic members of 
the Mimina'. All those specimens which I have had opportunity of 
examining have booted tarsi, Merula-like bill, and a very characteristic 
Thrush-like plumage, while in Margarops these parts are character- 
istically Mimiue. (See fig. of M.f Kscatus given ahoy e.) Unfortunately, 
however, 1 have not been able to i)rocure a young specimen, and conse- 
quently I cannot tell whether its markings agree with those of the 
young of the other Turdidw, although I have but little doubt that this 



PROCEEDINGS OP UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 477 

will be found to be the case. The relationship to the Mimincc seems to 
be a very remote one, and even the external spotted appearance, which 
appears to have been the chief reason for uniting it with those birds, 
shows only a slight and very superficial resemblance to the genus Mar- 
gar ops. 

This genus is peculiar to the lesser Antilles.

having a large white patch at the tip. Wing somewhat rounded, the 
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries being longest; the third never 
longer than the sixth and considerably shorter than the fifth ; second 
primary shorter than the seventh, and never longer than two and three- 
fourth times the first; secondaries rather long. Bill large and rather 
slender; the commissure with a more or less distinct notch, only very 
little larger than two times the gonys; chin-angle not protruding before 
the nostrils. Eictal bristles inconspicuous. Tarsus somewhat length- 
ened, but less than twice the exposed culmen. Tail graduated and long, 
the outstretched legs falling far short of its tip ; the largest tail-feathers 
about five times the tarsus and about as long as the wing. Below and 
behind the eye a naked space. 

Remarks. — The few species composing this genus, which is confined 
to the West Indian Islands, form a well circumscribed group. It shows 
some relationship towards the Miminw, but as neither its position among 
the TiircUdw nor its validity as a distinct genus has been disputed, it needs 
no further remarks at this place.

Ee3IARIvS. — Tliis group shows a near relationship towards the Meru-

been treated. The characteristic shortness of the gonys, however, 
and the statement of Professor Baird of the very close relationship be- 
tween the genus Platycichia and Turdampelis {CicMo2)sis), which. I my- 
self have never seen, and between the latter and Myadestes,* led me to 
the conclusion that their proper jjlace will be here within the Myadestina', 
forming an intermediate link between the true Thrushes and the more 
aberrant looking Myadestes.

Cossyphopsis and Platycichia, thus forming, as it seems, a very natural group.

tliird not longer tb an the fiftb; second primary three and one-fourth 
times the first, and shorter than the seventh; secondaries very long, 
the distance from the tip of the longest of the greater wing-poverts to 
the tip of the longest secondary twice the distance from the latter 
point to the tip of the longest primary; bill Thrush-like, attenuated 
at the end; cidmen arched from the base; commissure rather straight, 
with a distinct subtermiual notch, three times the length of the short 
gonys ; chin-angle reaching considerably before the line of the nostrils, 
the openings of which are large and oval, the overhanging membrane 
being rather narrow; bristles along gape weak and short; tarsus mod- 
erate, longer than middle toe and claw, and considerably longer than 
one-fourth the longest tail-feather, but shorter than twice the exposed 
culmen; tail fan-shaped, emargiuated, the feathers gradually becoming 
longer from the middle pair outwards, the outer j^air decidedly the 
longest; the outer web of the outermost tail-feathers broadens con- 
spicuously toward the somewhat acuminate tip; longest tail-feathers 
less tlian four times the commissure. 

Remarks. — Of this genus only the type species is as yet known, but 
this bird is so peculiar as to show its difference from all other Thrushes 
at once. The shortness of the gouys, and several other features, point 
towards its position among the Plaiyeichlew, but the tail, with its 
emarginate shape, is, so far as I am aware, unique among those birds 
which can claim any relationship with it.

Eemarks. — Tliis genus and its type species have had a somewhat 
peculiar fate. Although twice mentioned in one of the most admired and 
admirable works of modern ornithology (Eev. Am. Birds, I, pp. 32 and 
436), it has been passed by in silence by all authors, and almost forgot- 
ten, until lately Mr. Sharpe (Cat. Birds, Brit. Mus., YI., p. 379) has 
reprinted the original definition and description. Even in Sclater and 
Salvin's Nomendator Avium NcotropicaUum this bird is omitted, and 
nobody has been able to obtain a second specimen besides the type. 

When examining the specimens of '■'• Turdus'''' flavipes and T. carhona- 
rius I felt soon convinced that they did not belong to the true Merulea; 
but that their proper place would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 
Myadestes, and had just decided to make them types of a new genus, 
the name of which 1 had already composed, as I was struck by the 
agreement of their peculiar characters with those of Platycichla. I con- 
sequently very eagerly compared specimens of the two species men- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 481 



tioned above with the type specimen of Professor Baird's P. brevipes, 
and foaud them, to my great surprise, agree so well that I am convinced 
that the latter species is only the female of Jfavijjes, or of a very nearly 
allied species. I have no female of fiavipes at hand for comparison, but 
the structural features are so nearly the same, and the descriptions of 
the females of this species agree so well with the color of hrevipes, that 
I have no doubt that my identification is right. The only difl'erence 
which I can detect is the somewhat shorter tarsus of brevipes, but this 
is perhaps only an individual variation, although it possibly may turn 
out to be a difierent species. 

We would then have the following vspecies within this genus: 

1. Plati/cichla brevipes (Baird). 

2. Flatycichla Jlarlpes (ViQiW.). 

3. Platyeiclila carbonaria (Licht). 

As to the generic name, it may be remarked that flavipes has been 
formerly united with its near relative, Ciclilopsis leucogenys, Cab. within 
the genus Myiociclila "Schiff".", as the type of which it has usually been 
regarded. But it will seem from the following remark of Bonaparte, 
the first author by whom the genus 2IylocicMa was published, that the 
leucogeiu/s is the true type. He says (Notes Coll. Delattre, p. 30), ^'■Tur- 
dus JiavipcH, Vieill. {carbonarius 111., ardesiacus Cuv. nee Auct. !) est 
pour Schilf une Myiocichla ; mais y est-il bien place si le type de ce 
genre est, comme nous le croyons, sa Myiocichla ochrata, du Bresil ( Turdus 
brunneus! Frejreiss, nee Auglorum et Bodd.)". In this case the name 
Professor Baird has given it will stand.

Eemarks. — As I have not had the opportunity of examining any 
specimen, I have nothing to add to Professor Baird's description (?. c), 
of which I have given extracts above, showing the essential characters 
in the same manner as are given the marks of the other genera here 
defined and described. 

Although it may be admitted that there is some doubt as to the iden- 
tification of the species of Lesson, belonging to his genus TurdamjieUs, 
I think that this name is the same as Cklilopsis of Oabanis. 

The genus is only known to embrace two species, one of which is but 
lately described, viz : Turdampelis leucogenys (Cab.), and TurdampeUs 
gularis (Salvin & Godman), Ibis, 1882, p. 76.

the exposed culnien, and about one-fourth or less the length of the long-

of tail-feathers always considerably shorter than the longest; feathers 
rather narrow, tapering gently from base to tip, the shafts of the outer- 
most converging towards the tip ; longest tail-feathers never shorter 
than four times the commissure. Feathers of occiput full and some- 
what lengthened. 

Eemakks. — The relationship of this genus has already been pointed 
ont. I will here only remark that I am inclined to believe that the 
'• Flycatching Thrushes," besides their close afduities to Turdampelis 
and the Platycichlea', on the other hand are somewhat related to the 
iSialea\ That the group, besides, show some relationship towards cer- 
tain African forms is not so very surprising, when \vg remember several 
other affinities of South American and West Indian birds with forms 
from Africa. A very striking instance is in this respect the close rela- 
tionship between members of the genus Merula — especially those com- 
posing the division Flanesticns — inhabiting the two continents. 



* The recently adopted spelling is Myiadectes (see Sliarpc, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., vi, 
p. 3G8, where Salvin and Godmau are erroneously given as the original authors). This 
is intended to be an ''improvement" or " correction" of Swaiuson's original name, 
being, however, quite unnecessary, as the derivation of MyarZes^es is from Mi!f4 (att. for 
fiviu), a fly, and 'Edeanic (Hdt. 3, 99)=an eater, devourer.

OIV THE FAlTIir.V C^EIVTKOPOitHO/E. 

BY TIIEOI>ORE GILL. 

The genus Centropoinus of the uropical American seas aud rivers has 
generally been referred to the family Percidii'. As long ago as 1865, 
however, I was struck by the remarkable differences in its osteology from 
any other fishes known to me, and communicated the results of my 
examination to Professor Poey, who agreed with me that the type was 
entitled to family distinction. Both Pri)fessor Poey and myself have, 
therefore, isolated the form in question as a peculiar family. That 
family has, however, n^t yet been characterized, and the object of this 
communication is to indicate some of the most peculiar features which 
distinguish the form from those with which it has been usually associ- 
ated. The want of an accessible large collection of skeletons precludes 
a detailed comparison with many types, but most of the American genera 
of Percid;^, (typical), Labracid*, Serranidaj, and Sparida? have been 
examined as to their skulls at least. It is possible that the genus Lates 
aud even Ni])hon may be more nearly related, but no skeletons of those 
fishes are available. It is to be hoped that the present notice may at- 
tract attention to their relations.

NOMEIVCIiATUKE OF THE XIHHIID8. 
BY THEODORE C^ILL. 

The syiiouymy of tlie family XipbiidjiB and its subfamilies has been 
partially given in Professsor Goode's excellent article on "The Taxon- 
omic relations and geographical distribution of the members of the 
Sword-fish tamily" (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., v. 4, pp. 415-433, 1882), and 
may be supplemented by the following exhibit. As the characters of 
the several groups have been already well given by Professor Goode, it 
is unnecessary to repeat them here. It may be stated, however, that 
skeletal differences confirm those used for the diagnoses, and the verte- 
broe especially are even characteristic for the distinction of two families. 

The old family Xiphiidse has been differentiated by Dr. Giinther, as a 
"division" from the Scombrida^ and the latter contradistinguished in 
a "division" of Acanthopterygians containing many very heterogene- 
ous forms. Nevertheless, a careful study of the type renders it evident 
that the family is closely related to the Scombrida^, and the genus Acan- 
thocA/Mum, a representative of that famil^^, manifests an incipiency of the 
characteristics of the Xiphiidiie in the structure of the gills as well as 
the projection of the snout, the development of the dorsal fin, andj to a 
less extent, other features. As LUtken and Goode have expressly con- 
tended, and as I indicated in 1873, by the seqnence in the "Catalogue of 
the Fishes of the Eastern Coast of the United States" (pp. 9, 3), the 
Tetrapturinae or Histiophorinre are the most generalized forms of the 
family and deviate least from the Scombridte while the Xiphiinse are 
highly specialized, and by the inferior position of the pectorals and in- 
vestment of the fins mimic the sharks, the largest of which they almost 
rival in size.

OIV THE FAMIIiY ANO !mJBFA:TII£,IX:S OF CARANOIDJC:. 
BY THEODORE OILL. 

The family of Carangidae, as limited by me iu the ''Arrangement of 
the lamilies of Fishes" (also as iu the Proc. Acad. Xat. Sc. Phila., for 
18C2, p. 430, after the exclusion of Pomatomns) is an exceedingly natural 
one, notwithstanding the differences iu external form. I have examined 
skulls of representatives of all the groups hereinafter named, and their 
common characters are so numerous, while their severally peculiar ones 
are so insignificant that the so-called subfamilies are scarcely entitled to 
that rank. The most characteristic skull is manifested in Tracliynotus ; 
in that form, the orbito-rostral portion is shorter in comparison, the post- 
frontal bones larger and more projecting, the inner lateral crests more 
produced forwards than in any others, and the ethmoid is abbreviated 
and markedly and abruptly declined. Analagous characters in many 
families, however, are of inferior systematic value. It is to be also re- 
marked that the Caranginte and Seriolinse are especially nearly allied, 
so far as their crania are concerned, and there is even less superficial 
difference between the skull of Seriola and most Carangina* — e. g. Car- 
angus — than between it and the related genus Elagatis. 

Greatly as the elongated Trachurus and the high Selene differ, even 
they essentially agree as to the structure of the skull, that of Selene 
differing from the Carangine chiefly in being compressed, with its crest 
elevated and extended backwards and its rcstral portion attenuated and 
produced forward. Its ethmoid especially is characteristic in being much 
compressed and carinated above instead of flattened and double- 
headed. If, therefore, the subfamilies already indicated are retained 
in the present communication, it is rather in order to epitomize the his- 
tory expressed in their nomenclature than because I insist on or per- 
sist in their retention. The haernal canal is perhaps more characteristic.

Dr. Giinther {op. cit, p. 417) has claimed special merit for his family 
of Carangidai, remarking "that several authors have also distinguished 
a family Camuffidoe, but if they defined it at all tliey have applied char- 
acters very different from those given above [his remarks], and have 
not paid attention to the structure of the skeleton." I am not aware that 
any author except Bleeker hatl previously distinguished a family Ca- 
rangidje; the name "Carangida^," suggested by Agassiz, being merely 
an orthographical substitute for subfamily names of the Caran^inj^. 
As is too often the case with that author, Dr. Giinther has withheld all 
definite information and means of verification of his statement. It 
may be added, too, in this connection, that Dr. Giinther had evidently 
also "not paid attention to the structure of the skeleton" further than 
as to the number of the vertebr;ie, for had he done so he would have 
avoided the remarkable combination of genera he has assembled as 
constituents of his "OarangidiT?." 

Tlie family may be briefly diagnosed as follows : 

Scombroidea* with the vertebrne in typical (10 +14), or nearly typi- 
cal, number, the skull not expanded backwards and outwards, but with 
the internal as well as external lateral crests continued backwards to 
the exoccipital condyles, and the frontal bones coalesced ; the body 
moderately elongated and more or less compressed; a short spinous dor- 
sal more or less developed, and a long soft dorsal and anal fins, the lat- 
ter preceded by a more or less detached and distinct finlet of two spines 
( SOI n eti m es atrophied) . 

The more detailed characteristics are as follows : 

Body oblong, compressed, generally subfusiform (sometimes fusiform, 
sometimes elevated), highest below the first dorsal fin, and with a slen- 
der caudal i)eduncle. Anus anteromedian. 

Scales small, generally cycloid, and regularly imbricated. 

Lateral line continuous to and ending at the base of the caudal tin. 

Head compressed, oblong or short, and witli the crown generally de- 
curved or arched. Eyes moderate and submedian or anterior. 

Siihorhital bones small and not articulated with the preoperculum. 

Opercular bones normaWy develoi^ed; suboperculum forming most of 
the posterior border and the angle. 

Nostrils double, in front of each eye. 

Mouth moderate, with the cleft lateral and little oblique, generally 
partly extending under the eyes. 

Upper jaw not protractile, formed above by the prem axillary bones,

pared with spariform aud perciform lishes, e. <j.) mauilest iu the Car.augidte.

whose posterior or ascending- processes are short, and on tlic sides l)y 
the supraniaxilhxry liones, which are expanded towards the ends. 

Teeth acute, variable in position, and sometimes entirely obsolete or 
lost in old age. 

Branchial apertures very large and ample. Branchiostegal mem- 
brane deeply' emarginated, sustained generally by 7 rays on ea<'h side 
(rarely by 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10.) 

Sjiinous dorsal fin short, generally fully developed, but sonu'times 
represented by free spines, which may be very small or eveu obsolete. 

Soft dorsal fin commencing near the middle of the length, and little 
less than half as long as the trunk. 

Anal fin opposite to, and generally nearly equal to, the soft dorsal, 
with two (rarely obsolete) spines in front, detached from the fin. 

Caudal fin forked, and with its lobes slender and pointed. 

Pectoral fins inserted at the normal moderate height above the breast 
on the scapular arch ; they are generally pointed. 

Ventral fins thoracic and usually normally developed, each having a- 
spine and five branched rays, which are regularly graduated. (In the 
Paropsincv they are obsolete.) 

The vertebrfB are in normal (10 + 14) number, with few deviations 
{e. r/., Naucrates, with 10 + 10) 5 they are much contracted at the middle 
(like an hour-glass), and most (the costiferous and last caudal excepted) 
have anterior as well as posterior zygapophyses above and below, and 
the anterior pair of one vertebra are frequently interposed (or so tend) 
between the posterior pair of the preceding; the neurapophyses and 
hoemapophyses spring from near the middle or contracted portion of tlie 
vertebra?, and are moderately curved backward; the costiferous verte- 
brte have pits behind or above the parapophyses for the reception of the 
ribs ; the parapophyses are obsolete on the anterior vertebr;e, and only 
moderately developed backwards. 

The skull is oblong, inclining to triangular, seen from above; the 
brain-case is not expanded backwards or outwards, but provided with 
extensions from the lateral external and internal crests towards the 
exoccipital condyles ; the internal crests are continued forwards in a 
nearly or quite parallel direction ; the frontal bones are co-ossified ; the 
vomer projects forwards and downwards ; the post-frontals are more or 
less excavated or impressed on their inferior surface.

Habitat. — High seas. ♦ 

It will be thus seen that twelve uomiiial species were based on s])eci- 
niens of this one by Cuvier and Valenciennes, and nine by Dr. (xiin- 
tlier, who referred some to the family Carangidie because they were sup- 
posed to have 24 (10 + 14) vertebne, and one to the family Scombridae, 
because the skeleton in the B. M. had 2(5 (10 + 14) vertebrae, I dem- 
onstrated in 1SG2 that all such forms belonged to one species, and the 
truth of this has been generally recognized since.

27. Pharomacrus niocinno costaricensis (Cab.). 

Note.— In commenting upon Dr. Cabanis's proposed separation of 
the Costa Rican "Quezal" from that of Guatemala, Mr. Salvin points 
out (Rroc. Zool. Soc. Loud., 1870, pp. 202, 203) the apparent unstability 
of the characters adduced. So far as my own experience goes, however, 
it is usually, if not always, quite easy to distinguish between birds from 
the two countries at first glance. I have just measured 19 adult males 
of the Costa Rican form, and find that in none of them do the longest 
upper tail-coverts exceed 30 iuches in length from their insertion, the 
average being only 25^ inches, the minimum 19 inches. In none of them 
are there more tbau two of tliese feathers greatly elongated. The Guate- 
malan specimens which I have examined are unfortunately fewer in 
number,* ]>ut they could all be very readily distinguished not only by 
the very much longer and broader, but also more compact- webbed covert- 
plumes, while the shade of green was also appreciably more golden. I 
cannot at present give measurements of the Guatemalan bird, but am 
quite satisfied that the differences alluded to will be found reasonably 
constant.* 



* I have haadled altogether probably nearly 100 males of the Costa Eicau bird. 

* Since the above was written I bave had an opportunity of measuring three 
specimens of the Guatemalan bird with the following result: Longest tail-coverts, 
34-35.50 (average, 35.00); tail proper, 8-8.75 (average, 8.45); wing, 8.20-9 (average, 
8.63).

BRIEF DKSCKIPTIOIVS OF FOS.«IIi PLANTS, IHIEFI.V TERTIAKY, 
FROITI WESTERN IVOKTia AMEKIC'A. 

BY J. S. ]\EWBERRY. 

The following brief characterizatious of fossil plants from the West 
are supplementary to the descriptions issued in the " Notes on Our Later 
Extinct Floras", published in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural His- 
tory of New York, 1808. Fuller descriptions, with figures of all the 
species enumerated in both series, with others yet to be added, will 
soon appear in a volume which is to form one of the Eeports of the 
United States Geological Survey. ]\Iost of the fossil plants here enu- 
merated were collected by Dr. F. Y. Hayden, but a large number have 
also been obtained by I'rof. Thos. Condon, State geologist of Oregon, by 
Prof. J.J. Stevenson and his assistant, Mr. I. C. Russell, "and by others 
whose names are indicated in connection with their contributions. 

Most of the originals of these descriptions will be placed in the Na- 
tional Museum and the annotated catalogue now issued finds an appro- 
priate place in the Proceedings of the IMnseum.

NOTE OIV THE iTIVZONT.^ On ITfARSIPOBRAIVCHIATES. 
BY THEODORE: OILL. 

Inasmuch as it has been stated by Dr. Giinther, in his recent "Guide 
to the Study of Fishes" (p. 1), that " according to the views generally 
adopted at present, all those vertebrate animals are referred to the class 
of fishes" which are below the Amphibians, the following note is added 
iti connection with the succeding papers. 

The heterogeneity of the combination formerly regarded as the class 
of fishes is now so evident to any one who has familiarized liimself with 
the anatomy of the vertebrates that it is unnecessary to detail the points 
of difference. Suflflce it to state that the differences between the Lepto- 
eardians, Marsipobranchiates, and typical Fishes at least are far greater 
than those between any adjoining classes of terrestrial vertebrates. To 
still confound them in a single class is therefore a taxonomic falsehood, 
without any justification from either a scientific or "practical" stand- 
point. The degree of divergence of the branchiferous vertebrates has 
been aptly recognized by Hiickel, Gegenbaur, Lankester, etc., in their 
classifications, by the difierentiation of AmpMoxus from all the other verte- 
brates and of the Marsipobranchiates from all those thereafter remain- 
ing. AmpMoxus has even been excluded from the true vertebrates 
by Semper (1874), Hoppe-Seyler (1877), and Balfour* (1880). In the 
United States there is not a single active ichthyologist who does not 
admit at least three classes of branchiferous vertebrates — the Leptocard- 
ians, Marsipobranchiates, and Fishes. The remark of Dr. Giinther, 
therefore, finds no illustration in the United States, and the exceptions 
are conspicuous and brilliant even in England^ 

* There is only a nominal diiference between the views of Lankester and Balfour, 
the former enlarging the term Vertebrata to include the Tunicates, and the latter

NOTE ON THE BDEEI^O.^TOilIID.E AND MVXINID^. 

BY THEODORE OILL. 

In 18712, in ray "Arrangement of the Families of Fishes," I have rec- 
ognized two families iti the order Hyperotreta, and recently have com- 
municated to Professors Jordan and Gilbert a new generic name for 
the many-gilled species. I herewith give diagnoses of the family and 
genera. The distinctions in each case, from the nearest allies, are so 
evident that the groups do not really need justification. Kevertheless, 
as others have thought differently, it is not superlluous to add that 
characters analogous to such as have been used to differentiate the fam- 
ily and genera would be regarded as of great systematic value in the 

* The genus i/^/J^JHe was referred to the class Vermes. 

t These "classes" are regarded as constituents of a "grade" (" Cyclostoma") con- 
trasting with another (Guathostoma) including all the vertebrates with jaws. 



518 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

classes of selachians and true fishes, and the only comprehensible reason 
why they should not be so regarded in the present case is because the 
species are few in number. Inasmuch, however, as the function of tax- 
onomy is to express morphological truths, and not the quantities under 
which a given type is manifested, such reasons appear to be very insuffi- 
cient. 
The synonymy of the order Hyperotreta is appended.

Bdellostomids with an increased number of branchijie (about 10 or 11 
on each side) and the base of the tongue between the seventh or 
eighth pair of gills. 

* "It is to be regretted that Dunieril's appellation of Heptatrema, by referring to a 
point of organic structure subjected to variations, couhl not be retained to designate 
these fishes generically. If that name be restricted to the species provided with seven 
respiratory apertures, then each species would constitute a genus by itself; that 
with six of these aperturesoughtaccordingly be called //exa/re/na; fhen Reterotrema 
when six are observed on one side and seven on the other ; Hepiatrema when seven ; 
and finally Polytrema for the species described farther on. 

"Considering, however, the structui-e of the mouth, both internally and externally, 
we would not hesitate in uniting them all under the well appropriate mrnxGoi Bdellos- 
toma, suggested by Professor Miiller." — Girard, op. cit.

"Eleven gill openings on each side; ten teeth on the anterior and

" It is rather singular that this fish, which is abundant in Eel River,

escaped notice. I believe it to be the only species of its genus hitherto 
found on the Pacific coast of North America; and it difi'ers Irom Bdell-

DENDRCECA ADELAIDE DELICATA, Subsp. nov. 

Oh. -Difiering from J). adelaida\ from Porto Ilico, in very much more 
intense yellow superciliaries and lower parts, the former much broader 
(occupying the whole of the forehead except a central line), more decided 
plumbeous of the upper parts, more distinct black mark on sides and 
fore part of the crown, larger size, and other particulars. 

Adult ( 5 ?) : Middle of crown, occii)ut, auriculars, sides of neck, and 
upper parts in general, clear uniform plumbeous; crown bordered ante- 
riorly and laterally by a broad /^-shaped mark of deep black, the apex 
of which is continued in a narrow streak to the base of the culmen, 
dividing two very broad frontal patches of intense yellow, which ex- 
tend backward, more narrowly, to just behind the eye ; a large sub- 
orbital spot of clear yellow, separated from that of the forehead by a 
narrow dusky loral streak. Malar region, chin, throat, and entire lower 
parts, except anal region and crissum, very rich, pure gamboge yellow, 
the first separated from the yelJ w suborbital spot by a dusky rictal 
stripe, which gradually blends posteriorly into the plumbeous of the 
auriculars; anal region, crissum, and lining of the wing pure white. 
Wings dusky black, the feathers edged with plumbeous, and both rows 
of coverts very broadly tipped with pure white, forming two conspicuous 
bands ; tail feathers black, edged with plumbeous, the lateral feather 
with about .80 of an inch of the end of the inner web white, the next 
two similarly marked, but the white areas gradually reduced in size, 
tlie fourth feather with merely a broad terminal edging and small sub- 
terminal spot of white. Bill brownish black; feet horn-brown. Wing,

Sp. en.— Adult (N^o. 26997, U. S. Nat. Mus. ; "Chili, S. Am.;" collec- 
tor and donor unknown) : Forehead (broadly) superciliary stripe (ex- 
tending back to end of auriculars), cheeks (up to lower eyelid) and lower 
parts generally, pure white, the whole breast strongly tinged with light 
pinkish cinnamon, this growing gradually deeper cinnamon on the sides 
of the neck and across the nape. A distinct stripe from the rictus to the 
eye, across the lores, the whole crown, and auriculars, black. Occiput 
and upper parts in general, deep brownish gra.^ , tinged, especially on 
the back, with light yellowish fulvous. Primaries dusky, Avith white

side of the breast, and the breast and jugulum snowy white, besides other 
minor differences. 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 527 

There is iiotLiiig known as to the history of the type specimen, the 
Museum record giving simply the locality as above quoted. 

I have for a long time hesitated to describe this bird as a new species, 
having an idea that it might perhaps i^rove an abnormal example of JE. 
collaris, but that such is not the case 1 am now quite convinced, since I 
have had the opportunity to examine large series of the latter species, 
including sijecimens from Chili. 



CATAr,0«UE OF A C'OI>I.Et'TffO!V OF BIRD!^ ITffABE AT VARIOUS

JVOKTH OF CAPE ST. EUGEIVEO. 

BY L. BEI.OIIVG. 
[Edited by E. Eidgway. ] 

[The most important result of Mr. Belding's explorations along the 
western coast of Lower California is the discovery of the fact that, as fiir 
south at least as Cerros Island and Sta. Eosalia Bay (or to latitude 
about 28^ north) the bird-fauna presents no differences whatever from 
that of the southern coast of California, in the vicinity of San Diego. The 
coast between Sta. Eosalia Bay and Cape St. Lucas being entirely un- 
explored zoologically, it is of course unknown where the San, Diego 
fauna merges into, or gives way to, that of the cape district. Since, 
however, we are accustomed to look to topographical indications as 
a probable solution of questions of this kind, it seems not unlikely that 
the promontory of Cape St. Eugenio, which, as a lateral offshoot from 
the main range extends quite to the sea-coast on the south side of the 
bay in question, may form the dividing line; but it is, of course, quite 
possible that the San Diego fauna may extend much farther toward 
the cape. This question, however and that of how far northward along 
the eastern side of the peninsula the peculiar fauna of the cape dis- 
trict extends, can only be decided by further investigation. — R. R.] 

I. Coronados Islands, about 20 miles south and west of San Diego. 

These islands are small and rocky, and situated about 10 miles off" the 
coast of Lower California. The larger island is inhabited by several 
species of reptiles which are found also on the mainland, thus affording 
good evidence of former connection with the peninsula. 

A few birds only were taken on and in the vicinity of these islands, 
May IG and 17, the more important of which are the following : 
1. Hseniatopus palliatus Temm. 

[A single specimen, collected May 17, is the only example of this 
species in the National Museum from any locality on the Pacific coast of 
North America north of Mazatlau. Not mentioned in Mr. Belding's 
notes. — R. R.] 



528 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

2. Haematopus niger Pall. 

A few of these birds found here. 

3. Phalacrocorax penicillatus (Brandt). 

Very abundant here, at Cerros, and several intervening i^oints. 

2, San Quentln Bay, ivest coast of Lower California, latitude about 30'^ 23'. 

I arrived at this place May 2, and remained until the 11th. Much of 
the bay is shallow, consequently at low-tide very extensive mud flats 
are exposed, making this a favorite resort for water birds, Avhich upon 
our arrival were very abundant, but previous to May 11 most of them 
had taken their departure for their northern breeding grounds. So tkr 
as observed, the hind birds of this locality are about the same as those 
found in the vicinity of San Diego. 

1. Harporhynchus redivivus (Gamb.). 

Eare; apparently the same as the San Diego bird. [No specimens.] 

2. Thryomanes bewicki spilurus (Vig.). 
Not comuion. 

3. PassercnliLS anthinus (Bp.). 

Very common in grassy meadows ; probably resident here and at San 
Diego. 

4. Melospiza fasciata samuelis Baird. 

But one individual noticed. This was found in tules by a pond of fresh 
water. 

5. Pipilofuscus crissalis (Vig.). 

Specimens shot but not preserved appeared to be identical with others 
shot at San Diego in April and May. 

6. Guiiaca caerulea(Linn.). 

Ifare ; observed May 8, in an extensive willow thicket. [No speci- 
mens.] 

7. Calyptecostae (Bonrc). 
Common. [No specimens.] 

8. Lophoi'tyx californica (Shaw). 
Moderately common. 

9. Squatarola helvetica (Linu.), 
Common as late as May 10. 

10. .Sigialites semipalmatus Bp.. 
Eare. 

11. ^gialites alexandrinus nivosus (Cass.). 
Eare, but mated, and probably breeding. 

12. Pelidna alpina americana (Cass.). 

Abundant May 2, but rare by the 10th of the month. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 529 

13. Ereuuetes pusillns occidentalis (Lawr.). 

The same remarks apply to this as to the last. 

14. Limosa fceda (Liun.). 

Abundaut early iu May ; perhaps a few breed here, as single birds 
were several Mmes flushed from the meadows, and their actions led me 
to believe they had nests in the vicinity. 

15. Rallus obsoletus Ridgw., 

Although only two of these birds were seen here, considering their 
habits this would not determine the question of rarity or abundance; 
for marshes, such as birds of this family delight in, are here numerous, 
extensive, and dififlcult of exploration. One of the birds was flushed 
from her nest, which was well concealed in and beneath rank marsli 
grass on the bank of a slough, the eggs were eight to ten in number 
(some of ihem being crushed by the foot of a companion), and contained 
large embryos. 

16. Bernlcla nigricans (Lawr.). 

Several small flocks were apparently much at home in the bay until 
May 9 or 10, when they disappeared. One of the specimens shot w^is 
astonishingly fat, and had been feeding on eel-grass, their usual food at 
this locality. The species was also seen at Sa^^ Diego in April. 

17. Dytes uigricollis californicus (Heerm.). 
Very common May 16. 

3. Santa Rosalia Bay, tvest coast of Lower California, latitude 28^ 28.' 

Crossing from Cerros Island to this locality, after waiting a day for 
the surf to subside, a landing was effected April 28. 

In a brisk walk of Ave hours five species of land birds were observed. 
At the end of this time a fresh, increasing breeze made a hurried de- 
parture from this barren, arid region necessary. 

Ihave been informed by persons who appeared to be acquainted with 
the coast that there is no fresh water between Magdalena Bay and some 
point not far from Sacramento Keef, and on this coast a collector's 
greatest danger is that he may perish from thirst. 

1. Poliptila californica Brewst. 
Common. 

[XoTE. — In the absence of specimens it would be quite hazardous to 
conjecture whether- the above-named species or P. plumhea, Baird, was 
tlie one seen. The latter, only, occurs in the vicinity of Cap', St. Lucas, 
but it may be that on the Pacific side of the peninsula it is replaced by 
P. californica. — E. E.j

4. Cer'ros Island, icest coast of Lower California (latitude just north of the 
parallel of 28°.) 

Arriving at tbis island April 14, twelve days were spent in explor- 
ing it. 

The total length of Cerros Island is about 20 miles, its greatest width 
about 8 miles. The highest peak reaches an altitude of about 4,000 feet, 
while much of the land is more than 1,500 feet above sea level. Like 
the western side of the peninsula, it is mostly rocky or sandy, and 
sparsely covered with, or in places entirely destitute of, vegetation. 
On the western side, from the crest-line downward, between 1,500 and 
2.000 feet altitude, there is a considerable forest of pines {Pinns mtiri- 
cata). This forest, from which much was expected, proved to be a 
very poor collecting ground, although a few beetles, spiders, and ants, 
not noticed elsewhere on the island, were procured here. Wild goats 
(descendants of domestic animals) were the only quadrupeds seen; but 
deer, no doubt, inhabit the island, since two pairs of discarded antlers 
were found. There were also indications of the presence of a rodent, 
probably a species of J^eotomys (Cave Rat). 

Sixteen species of land-birds were noted, five of them being repre- 
sented, so far as my observation is concerned, by a single specimen 
each; some of them may have been stragglers from the main land, as 
they were seeu during the period of migration. 

A "horned toad" {Phyrnosoma), three or four species of lizards, a 
tree-frog {Hyla), a few insects, and a land snail {Helix), comprised, ap- 
l^arently, with the other creatures herein enumerated, all there is of 
animal life on the island. 

The plants of Cerros Island are partly Californian and partly Lower 
Californian, some of the species of the southern part of the peninsula 
growing there. The California Holly [Heteromeles arhutifolia) and Ju- 
niperus caUfornicus were found, as well as the above-mentioned pine, 
the former growing in the pine forest. Fishermen go from all points of 
the compass to get the water from the spring on Cerros Island, desig- 
nated on the charts " Watering place." This water is not good, bu*;

will do iu the absence of better. It trickles out of a rock a few feet 
above sea level, and is marked by a bunch or two of bulrushes. There 
are also other bunches of bulrushes on the east side of the island, but 
this, I believe, is the southernmost of them all. 

1. Thryomanes bewicki spilurus (Vig.). 
Common. 

2. Troglodytes aedon parkmanni (And.)- 
Rare. 

3. Carpodacus frontalis rhodocolpus (Cab.). 
Three examples seen. 

4. Astragalinus psaltria (Say), 
Rare. 

5. Zonotrichia leucophrys (Forst.) 
Only one specimen seen. 

6. Amphispiza biliiieata (Cass.). 
Common. 

7. Zamelodia melaiiocephala (Sw.). 
Only one seen. 

8. Sturnella neglecta (And.). ♦ 
One or two observed only. 

9. Corvus corax carnivorus (Bartr.). 
Common. 

10. Tyrannus vociferans (Sw.). 

Three or four seen on the edge on the pine forest j altitude about 
2,000 feet. 

11. Sayornis sayi (Bp.). 

Common in cliffs near the beach ; paired. 

12. Empidonax difBcilis Baird. 

Only one seen. A bird of this species came aboard the sloop one 
foggy morning during the trip, when ten miles from the peninsula. It 
was secured, seemingly uninjured, but died soon afterwards. 

13. Calypte annae (Less.). 

But one example was seen. This was shot at an altitude of about 
2,000 feet. 

14. Calypte costae (Bourc). 

Common. A nest found April 10, contained recently hatched young. 

15. Pandion haliaetus carolinensis (Gin.). 
Very common, nesting on the cliffs. 

16. Cathartes aura (Liuu.). 
Very common. 



532 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

17. Heteroscelus incanus (Gm.) 
Seen on several occasions. 

18. Phalacrocorax dilophns cincinnatus (Brandt). 

A colony of about one hnndred of these cormorants were breeding on 
almost inaccessible cliffs which rose perpendicularly from the water. 
Seven nests, examined from above, contained either three or four eggs 
each. Thousands of this species were observed at Elida and St. Martin's 
Islands, and San Quentin Bay. 

[Note. — The specimens obtained are in full breeding plumage, and, 
so far as the skins indicate, can only be distinguished from the eastern 
forms, dilophus proper and JloiHdanus, by the entirely white superciliary 
tufts, these being wholly black or but slightly mixed with white in the 
above-named races. — R. R.] 

19. Larus heermanni Cass. 
Common. 

20. Thalasseus regius Gamb. 
Common in April, rare in May. 



CATALiOGUE OF A t'Ot, LiECTIOX OF BIRDS IVIADS: IVEAR THE ISOVTH- 
EKN EXTREMITY OF THE PEIXUVSULA OF I.OVVER CALIFORNIA. 

BY JL. BELDI^O. 

[Edited by R. Ridgway.] 

This paper is merely intended to give what are supposed to be the 
most interesting results of a winter's work in Lower California. Sick- 
ness in May, occasioned by exposure to the hot sun, prevented a con- 
templated visit to one or more high mountains near the village of Mira- 
ilores, and also prevented the securing of specimens of some well-known 
birds at San Jose — consequently the list is not as complete as it might 
otherwise have been. 

Some of the species found by Xantus do not appear in the list. 
Perhaps the most important of these is the rare Cape Eobin {Merula 
conjiilis), which, with Columha erythrina, is probably a bird of the mount- 
ains. 

Most of the Cape species are, as in 1859, abundant and tame. 

It appears quite likely Mr. Xantus neglected to report some very 
common, well-known residents, since these do not appear in his list.* 

*The only papers relating specially to the biidsof the vicinity of Cape Saint Lucas 
are the following :

Others wliicli are recorded from Cape Saint Lucas were probably 
obtained at other though not very distant localities. 

The fauna and flora of La Paz, Cape Saint Lucas, and San Jose del 
Cabo, are quite identical, allowing for difference in surroundings and in 
variety of collecting' grounds. 

For the purpose of determining the resident species a later stay at 
San Jose was desirable, but I was compelled reluctantly to leave the 
field. 

Collections were made at La Paz from December 15, 1881, to March 
21, 1882; at San Jose from April 1, 1882, to May 17, of the same year.

The first two papers cited above wore based upon an early installment of Xautus's 
collections, no list of the species subsequently obtained by him having ever been pub- 
lished. I have, therefore, gone over the record books of the National Museum and 
made a careful enumeration of all the species collected by Xantus in Lower California. 
The total number of species amounts to 130, of which only 42 are included in Professor 
Baird's list. Of the species collected by Xantus 34 were not found by Mr. Belding, 
who, however, obtained or observed 39 species not represented in Xautus's collections. 
The latter are distinguished in the present catalogue by a * prefixed to the number, 
while a list of those obtained only by Xantus is given herewith.

* 16. Dendrcsca vieilloti bryanti, Eidgw. 

(See vol. 4, these proceedings, page 444. — R. R.) 

Common in the shrnbbery around the Bay of La Paz; also seen at 
Picluilinque Bay and Espiritu Santo Island. It frequented almost ex- 
clusively the mangroves {Bhizopora marujle), and is probably resident.

Common. 



18. Siurus naeviUs notabilis Grinuell. ? 
Rarely seen. 

[I am now inclined to believe that the type specimen of aS^. ncevius 
notabilis was an unusually large one, especially as regards the bill, since 
I have not yet met with any other western example of the species which 
agrees with it in dimensions. The two examples obtained by Mr. Beld- 
ing are decidedly smaller, but both are females. 1 give below their 
measurements, as well as those of the type of S. notahilis and two other 
examples, which I refer provisionally to the same. form. The tj^pe speci- 
men of notahilis is so very different in proportions from any of the 
many eastern specimens of S. ncevins which I have examined, that I 
am not yet prepared to yield its claim to recognition as the represen- 
tative of a geographical or local race of the species; but whether other 
western specimens belong to the same form or not, is a question which 
can only be determined by more abundant material.

[The fine series collected by Mr. Beldinf? shows the character of this 
well-marked race as given in Hist. N. Am. Birds (vol. i, pp. 4G0, 4G8) with 
wonderful uniformity. In five adult males the forehead, superciliary 
stripe, cheeks, throat, breast, upper part of abdomen and sides, and in 
some even the belly and flanks, also, are clear, soft, rose-red ; the rump 
similar, but brighter — more of a carmine shade; thecri.ssuminall strongly 
tinged or washed with rose-pink ; the crown, occiput, nape, and whole 
back overlaid or very strongly tinged with deep Avine-red. — K. li.j 

28. Astragalinus psaltria (Say). 

Common. • 

*28. Chrysomitris pinus (Wils.). 

Only one observed ; this in a flock of A. psaltria, with which, in Cali- 
fornia, the species frequently associates. 

29. Passerculus rostratus (Cass.). 

[The series of 10 specimens obtained by Mr. Belding I find puzzling 
in the extreme. The majority of them agree exactly with typical speci- 
mens from San Diego and other parts of Southern California, while 
others difler in darker colors, thus forming an approach to P. guitafus, 
the unique type of which came from San Jose del Cabo. In fact, one 
specimen (No. 8G292, 9 , Feb. 25) agrees exactly with the latter in col- 
oration, and I had unhesitatingly referred it to the same species or 
race; but I now find, after a very close examination of a large amount 
of material, that it either cannot be guttatus or else the latter is nothing 
but an abnormally small, slender-billed individual of rostrafm, thus de- 
stroying the validity of guttatus altogether. Great as is the variation 



538 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM, 

in size and form of the bill iu rostratus, I am unable to find among 27 
examples of the latter a single one having the bill nearly so slender as 
in the type of guttatus, as the following measurements of the latter com- 
pared with the minimum corresponding measurements of rosiratus will 
show:]

From the above figures it is evident that the difference between spec- 
imens of P. rosiratus is greater than between smaller individuals of 
the same and the so-called P. gnttatiis^ except in the tJiichiess of the hill. 
In fact, all other measurements intergrade, as does also, unquestion- 
ably, the coloratiou. It therefore follows that if P. guttatus is allowed 
to rank as a species, or even subspecies, its claim to such rauk rests 
solely upon the peculiarly slender bill. 

Two specimeus collected on the island of San Benito, Pacific coast of 
Lower California, by Dr. T. H. Streets, U. S. ^. (i^os. 7063G and 70G37, 
U. S. Nat. Mus.), are labeled in the handwriting of Dr. S. '^ Passerculus 
sanctorinn Ooues (Type)," and are quite appreciably dilierent in colora- 
tion, and alsoiu tbe form of the bill, from ordinary P. rostratus, includ- 
ing an example (No. 70635) obtained by Dr. Streets at Todos Santos. 
The coloration of these two specimens being (ssentially identical with that 
of the type of P. guttatiis I had referred them to that supposed species ; 
but I now find that so far as measurements go, they belong rather to 
P. rosiratus. Certain it is, that among Mr. Belding'sLa Paz specimens 
are some which I cannot in any way distinguish from these San Benito 
specimeus, while others of the same series lead the way by the most 
gradual but complete transition to " typical " rosiratus. In order to 
make the matter more plain, I have divided the collection before me into 
three series, as follows : {a) Specimens typical of rosiratus as to colora. 
tion ; (b) types of '' P. sanctorum Cones ;" (c) specimens agreeing with 
"P. sanctorum'''' in coloratiou ; [d) specimens agreeing with the type of 
"P. guttatus'''' in coloration, and (e) the type of "P. guttatus'''' itself.

* 30. Coturniculus passerinus perpallidus Ritlgw. 
Hare, but seen at several localities. 

31. Chondestes grammica strigata (Sw.). • 
Common. 

32. Zonotrichia leucophrya (For.st.). 

Common at and south of La Paz, on May 1, during and after very 
hot weatlier. This species, Spizella hreiceri, and Pipilo chlorurun \\M3re 
missed from San Jose, and not afterward seen. This is the only Zono- 
trichia yet detected at and south of La Paz*, and the only one found by 
me in central California in summer south of 39°. It breeds regularly in 
the mountain meadows of Calaveras and Alpine Couutiest, at an alti- 
tude of 7,0U0 feet or more, where 1 have seen it uumated as late as July 
9. I have not yet found it below 7,000 feet. 

33. Spizella pallida (Sw.).

36. Pipilo chlorurus (Towns.). 
Common. 

37. Pipilo fuscus albigula (Baird). 
Not often seen at any locality. 

[The specimens obtained by Mr. Belding are in fine winter plumage, 
and all exhibit distinctly the characteristic features of the race, as 
distinguished from P. mesoleiiciis, in much more distinctly ashy breast, 
decidedly more trenchant definition of the bufify throat-patch, smaller 
size, etc. As- in P. mesoleucus, however, the throat is occasionally en- 
tirely unicolored, three of the seven examples showing no difference in 
intensity of the buff on different parts of the throat ; therefore, the 
phrase "ochraceous of throat palest posteriorly, where it becomes nearly 
white," as given in the diagnosis of the race on p. 122, vol. ii. Hist. N. 
Am. jB., requires some modification, to this extent, that when it does vary 
in intensity, it is palest posteriorly, instead of the reverse, as in P. mcso- 
leueus. — E. R.] 

* In the Xantus collection, from "Cape Saint Lncas," are a few examples of Z. 
intermedia, bnt most of the specimens obtained by Xantus are Z. leucophnjs. 

t Z. leucophrys is undoubtedly the species found by me breeding abundantly at Mount- 
ain Meadows, summit of Donner Lake Pass, in the Sierra Nevada, in July, 1867. In my 
report on the oruithology of the fortieth parallel (x). 471), the birds of this locality 
were erroneously referred to Z. intermedia, for the reason that no specimens were ob- 
tained, while at that time Z. leucoj}hrijsy<iix?, -not supposed to occur west of the Rocky 
Mountains. — R. R. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 541 

38. Cardinalis virginianus igneus (Baird). 
Common. 

[A fine series, including nine males and three females of this excellent 
race. — R. R.j 

39. Pyrrhuloxia sinuata Bp. 

Eather rare, less so in the interior. 

[The five adult males from Lower California difl:er from an equal num- 
ber of Texan examples in having the red of an appreciably lighter, less 
rosy, tint, and that around the fore part of the head very much clearer. 
An example from Camp Grant, Ariz., agrees with the peninsular 
specimens in this respect. It is possible that a largeo series will show 
these differences to be constant. In specimens obtained in Ajiril the 
bill is now, after the lapse of three months' time, still deep orange-col- 
ored, while in winter specimens the bill is horn-colored, the mandible 
paler, but scarcely inclining to yellowish. — E. E.] 

40. Zamelodia melanocephala (Sw.). 
Not common. 

*41. Passerina amoena (Say.). 
Not common. 

42. Calamospi^a bicolor (Towns.). 
Abundant.

[Specimens from Lower California appear to be quite identical with 
those from the coast region of California proper. If any different, they 
are purer white beneath, the crissum having absolutely no tinge what- 
ever of blue. — R. E.]

48. Myiarciius cinerascens Lawr. 
Common. 

49. Sayornis sayi (Bp.).

50. Sayornis nigricans (Sw.). 

Eaie. 

51. Empidonax difEcilis Baiid. 
Eare. 

52. Empidonax obscurus (Sw.). 

Very common in winter — more rare in summer. 

53. Pyrocephalus rubineus mexicanus (Scl.). 
One specimen only. 

54. Calypte costae (Boiirc). 

Abundant in %yinter ; not common at San Jose, Cape Saint Lucas, 
or Miraflores in April and May. 

[Two nests of this species, collected at La Paz, by Mr. Beldiug, are 
quite different in size and shape. Both are ordinary looking structures, 
composed of dull gray lichens and small pieces of thin bark, held together 
with spiders' webs, the interior containing a few soft small feathers, in 
one nest, apparently of the summer yellow bird {Dcndccca cestiva). The 
larger nest measures about 1^ inches in diameter by a little more than 
1 inch in depth, the cavity being about .1 x.80; the smaller one meas- 
ures about the same in diameter across the top, but is much narrower 
at the bottom, is less than 1 inch high, and has a shallower cavity with 
much thinner walls. Each contains a single egg, one of which measures 
.30X.50, the other .32x.50. The identification is positive, the parent 
bird accompanying each nest. One of these females has a very large 
spot or patch of metallic violet on the throat, while the other has instead 
only a few dusky specks. — R. E.] 

55. Basilinna xantusi (Lawr.). 

In winter, found only in mountain canons. It was common at the 
western base of Cacachiles mountain in Febriiary, more so, in fact, than 
C. costce. It was not observed at San Jose until some time after my 
arrival, though it occurred in cafions only two or three miles to the 
westward. About the last of April it was common in orchards at San 
Jose. 

While incubating, this species is very confiding and courageous, some- 
times remaining upon the nest until removed from it by the hand. A 
nest taken April 23 was placed underneath an awning or shade 
of boughs and weeds in front of a farmhouse. It was surrounded by 
downy heads of composite plants and could scai-cely be distinguished 
from them, having, as usual, been made of raw cotton. 

[The two nests of this species obtained by Mr. Belding are very neat 
structures, quite ditferent in appearance from the nest of any other 
North American Hummer, though they differ much from one another. 
The finer of the two (No. 18503, San Jose, April 23) is a compactly 
felted mass composed chiefly of raw cotton, but this coated exteriorly

with spiders' webs and light brown fine flbrons materials. It is securely 
fastened to two forks of a twig-, and rests between them. The shape is 
verj' irregular, owing to the manner in wbich it is secured to the twigs, 
but on top the transverse diameter is about 1.50 inches, the cavity being 
about 1 iuchacross and about .GO of an inch deep. The two eggs measure 
respectively .32 x .50 and .34 x .49, being essentially identical in size and 
shape with those of Calf/pte cosfre, from which it is apparently quite im- 
possible to distinguish tbem. The other nest (No. 18564, Arroyo, north 
of Santiago Peak, May 9) is quite different both in shape and material. 
It is very regularly but shallowly cup-shaped, averaging a little over 
1.50 inches in external diameter, but only about .80 of an inch in extreme 
height. The cavity is about 1 inch across by a little over .50 of an inch 
in depth. The material is chieliy raw cottou, but this much mixed, es- 
pecially outwardly, with flue leaf-stems, seed-capsules, spiders' webs, 
etc., besides one or two small soft white feathers. Like the other nest, 
this one is supjiorted between two twigs. The eggs measure respect- 
ively .34 X .49 and .32 x .50.— R. E.]

is very light colored, the usual abdominal belt of dusky markings being 
indicated only by very small hastate streaks ; the tibise are creamy 
white, barred with light rufous, aud the sides more distiuctly barred 
with dark brown aud rufous. It is somewhat doubtful wbether the

bon describes the color of the naked orbits as pink, the naked skin about base of the 
bill as deep blue, and the pouch greenish black. Thus it would seem that the soft 
parts are very differently colored. Should this difterence prove Constant, the west- 
ern bird would have to be separated as a race. — R. R.

only note traced to tbis species was a loud chip. I listened long, wben 
in tbe neigbborbood of one or more of tbese birds, for tbe familiar song 
■of the Maryland Yellow-throat {G. triclias), but failed to hear it. Their 
habits are quite like those of G. trichas, and the eggs are not materially

The female, while incubating, was very wary, slipping quietly away 
from the nest and returning to it very stealthily, below the tops of the 
reeds. 

The 1st of April I discovered four of these birds in a marsh, in which 
was a rank growth of tide, flags, and reeds. Having shot one of them, 
and the others were not molested, they remained in the marsh until May 
15, or later. This marsh, the only one seen during the winter, harbored 
several species not elsewhere noticed, among them Porzana Carolina. 
On one side of the marsh a lagoon or pond of fresh water, of 10 or 15 
acres extent, was the resort of numerous gulls, ducks, and waders. 

April 29 I noticed, for the first time during this visit to Lower Cali- 
fornia, Progne suhis, Petrochelidon lunifrons, and Cypselus saxatiUs cir- 
cling over the lagoon. It is a question whether these birds came from 
the mountains of the peninsula or from the mainland. 

May 1, while on the beach, a very large, compact flock of NumeniuH 
hudsonlcus was, with the aid of a field-glass, discovered in the distance, 
rapidly approaching from the south. After sweeping in large circles 
over the lagoon, thus enabling me to shoot several of them, they alighted. 
They appeared to be w^eary as well as strange birds. The following 
morning, as I could not find the flock, my impression was it had re- 
sumed the journey northward. 

That the birds of Lower California breed regularly in spring 1 have 
no doubt. The first nests ol)served were Pandmi-liaUaetus caroUnensis, 
Espiritu Santo Island, February 1 ; Auriparm flaviceps, La Paz, Feb- 
ruary 27 (nest in this case unfinished); Calypte costa;, La Paz, March 2, 
{bird setting). 

With the single exception of a juvenile "or dwarfed LophorUjx califor- 
niea, shot January 25, at Pichalinque Bay, and which was apparently 
but six or eight weeks old, no young birds were seen until April 14, 
when a brood of PoUoptila plumhea just out of the nest were observed. 

May 17, the last day of my stay at San Jose, I saw the following spe- 
cies, besides well-known residents :

Most of these twenty-seven species were breeding. 

The following- additional species were found at the village of Mira- 
flores, which lies two or three miles east of a peak of the same name. 
It is on a branch of the San Jose Eiver and is about twenty-five miles 
north of the town of San Jose. The trail leading to it follows the grad- 
ually ascending sandy bed of the river. The altitude of the village is 
about 700 feet. 

It was probably here that Xantus obtained his specimens marked 
*' Miratlores " instead of getting them from the high and quite inaccessi- 
ble, sharp, rocky peak of the same name, w- hich has an altitude of more 
than 6,000 feet. 

There is some very fertile bottom land here and numerous fine, large 
evergreen oaks grow on the Tincultivated portion of it. 

In these oaks were found, with other species — 

*1. Virosylvia gilva svrainsoni Bd. 
Moderately common May 9. 

*2. Dendiceca townsendi (Nutt.). 
An individual, male, seen April 4. 

*3. Pipilo maculatus megalonyx Baird.

4. Melanerpes formicivorus angustifrons Baird. 

Common, burrowing in oaks, whereas al! the other Woodpeckers of 
Lower California, including Colaptes chrysoides, as far as I have ob- 
served, burrow in the Giant Cactus [Gereus giganteus). 

*5. Micrathene whitneyi (Coop.). 
Common, if not abundant. 

Whitney's Pigmy Owl utters monotonous calls or whistlings, faint, 
tremulous notes, and when perched within a few feet of an intruder 
expresses its anxiety by complaining cries. 

As an attempt to describe the notes of three other obscurely known 
owls may not be out of place here, I transcribe the following from my 
journal: 

" Big Trees, August 10, 1880. Bright moonlight. 

" ^cops fiammeolus has a firm single note, which is often repeated after 
short intervals; shot specimen while calling."

•• Murphy's, October 2, 1880. This morning shot Glaucid'mm gnomay 
which I heard calling, and at first supposed it was the Yellow-billed 
Cuckoo {Cocc;/.zHs americanm). The specimen shot was perched outhe 
dead limb of a i^iue tree about 50 feet from the ground. Its calls varied 
but little iu the fifteen or twenty times I heard them. They may be 
nearly represented thus: ' Coo-coocoo-coo-coo-coo — coic — cow.^ The first 
six or seven guttural notes were equidistant, and uttered at the rate of 
about two in a second ; then, after a i^ause of about two seconds, the 
longer notes followed. It was occasionally answered in similar notes by 
an unseen bird. 

" Big Trees, July 13, 1881. Strix occidentalis. — Listened to its call 
about sunset ; the bird in sight. Its call resembles the barking of a 
dog, the first three or four notes lasting about one second each ; these- 
succeeded by long, harsh, whining notes." 



OIV TBE CENUS TANTALUS, 1.IIVIV., AND ITili ALLIES. 
BY ROBERT RIDOlfAV. 

The only species of Tantalus given by Linnaius in the tenth edition 
of "Systema Naturae" is T. loculator, which may, therefore, be properly 
regarded as the type of the genus. In the twelfth edition T. ibis also' 
appears, along with several true Ibisis of the genera Endocimus, Wagl., 
and Plegadis, Kaup. So far as I am able to ascertain, the T. ibis and 
other Old World species related to it have never been separated gen- 
erically from T. loculator ; but a recent careful comparison* has con- 
vinced me that they all belong to quite a distinct genus from 2\ locu- 
lator. Xo generic name having, to my knowledge, been yet given 
specially to the Old World species, I propose for this group the term 
Pseudotantalus. The main differential characters of the two genera may- 
be expressed as follows : 

Tantalus. — Adult with the whole head and upper half of neck 
naked, the skin hard and scurfy ; crown covered by a quadrate, or 
somewhat shield-shaped, smooth horny plate, and skin of nape trans- 
versely wrinkled or corrugated. Nostrils subbasal ; tertials longer than 
primaries, and with comjDact or normal webs. (Type, T. loculator Linn.) 

Pseudotantalus. — Adult with only the fore part of the head naked, 
the hinder half and entire neck densely feathered ; nostrils strictly 
basal ; tertials shorter than primaries, and with their webs somewhat 



* Although I have been able to actually examine only T. ibis, the excellent plates- 
and descriptions of the remaining species which have been consulted leave no doubt 
that all the Old World Wood Ibises are strictly congeneric. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 551 

decomposed. Bill, legs, and tail very much longer, and basal outline of 
l»ill of different contour. (Type, Tantalus ibis Linn.) 

The species belonging to Pseudotantahis, besides the type, are, so far 
as known, the following : 

P. leucocephalus (Gni.). India. 

P. lonfjuimembris (Swinh.). Southern China. 

P. lactens (Terani.). Java and Sumatra. 



SUPn^EME.'VTARY IVOTE ON THE PEDIt'UIiATI. 

BY THEODORE OILL. 

In the i^roceedings of the United States Xational Museum for 187S 
(v. 1, pp. 215-232), I have given the characteristics of the families, sub- 
families, and genera of the Pediculate fishes. The present communica- 
tion will supplement the article in question by detailing the synonyms 
of the families and subfamilies. The generic synonyms have been al- 
readv indicated. 

I. 

Since the publication of the "Note on the Antennariidae'' (op cit., pp. 
221-222), a "new genus" has been added to the family by Dr. A. Giin- 
ther, whicli may be distinguished as follows : 

Tetrabrachium. 

= Tetraltracliium, Giluther, Zool. Cballeuj^er, part C, p. 44, 1880. 

Antennariids with the body oblong conic from the head backwards; 
the skin naked; a compressed cuboidal head; small A^ertical mouth; 
dorsal spines (3) isolated and dwarfed, but exserted ; second largest, 
" wide and fringed ; " dorsal and anal fins low, long, and free behind ; and 
pectorals with the upper portion (4 rays) detached from the lower. 

Type, Tetrabracliiuiu ocellatuni, Gilnther, Zool. Challenger, part 6, p. 45, pi. 19, 1'. c. 

■ Ocean south of New Guinea (specimen obtained at a depth of 28. 
fathoms). 

All that has been suggested as to this interesting form is what may 
be implied by the reference to the " Pedicalidae," which, as appears b}- 
the "Systematic List" at the end of the volume (p. 78), is simply a mis- 
print for Pediculati. Possibly the nearest ally of the genus is Histio- 
pJiryne^ but it appears to be quite an isolated form. 

Dr. Liitken (Videusk. Medd. fra den Naturhist. Foren. Kjobeuhavn, 
1879-'80, pp. 67-68) has objected inter alia to the generic differentiation 
of Gorynolophus, but has not traversed or even met the reasons and ar- 
guments in favor thereof submitted by me (Proc. TJ. S. Nat. Mus., v. 1, 
p. 230). I therefore need only refer again to my original statement. 



552 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The differences alleged to exist between Himantololoiihus and Coryvol- 
ophus are very marked, and if they really do exist, as stated, there can 
be no doubt that the two should be kept apart. I know of no reason^ 
except the singularity and greatness of the differences specified, for 
doubting the correctness of Eeinhardt's observations on Himantolophus. 
and prefer to assume their reliability rather than to discredit them, but 
at the same time admit the desirability of confirmation. The burden 
of proof meanwhile lies on those who would keep the forms together, 
and not on those who would separate them. 

Finally, as to the genus Lojphius, it seems to me that the L. s€ti(fen(s 
should be generically distinguished from the L. 2niicato)'ius, notwith- 
standing the close external resemblance of the two. The two gTOups 
may be diagnosed as follows : 

LoPHius. — Lophiids with vertebrae in considerable number, i. e., 27 — 
31,* and toothed vomer. 

Tyj)e, Lophius jjiscaloriiis. 

LoPHio^rL^s. — Lophiids with vertebrie in diminished number. /. e., 
about 19, and toothed vomer. 

Type, Lophiomus setigerus^Lophius seligerus, Wahl. 

It is surprising that the two have not been differentiated by Dr. Giin- 
ther, inasmuch as he sometimes considers a difference of one or two ver- 
tebrae to be sufiacient to distinguish families.

1863 (Proc. Acad. Is"at. Sc. Phila., 1863, pp. 88-92), I have made kiiowu, 
in addition to the llalieutichthys reticulatus Poey, four species of Anten- 
narins. These have not been re-described under the names then given, 
but two, originallj' found in Lower California, have been found else- 
where, and described by Dr. Giinther under other names, as has just 
been recognized by Messrs. Jordan and Gilbert (Proc. U. S. Nat. ]Mus., 
V. 5, p. 370). Messrs. Goode and Bean have also recently recognized the 
two species described as inhabitants of the waters about the Florida 
Keys, in their " List of the Species of Fishes, recorded as occurring in 
the Gulf of Mesico" (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., v. 5, p. 235, 1882). The 
present status of the species is therefore as follows :

IVOTE OIV THE POSIATOMII)^. 

BV THEODORE OILE. 

lu 18G2, iu a " Synopsis of the Carangoids of the Eastern Coast of 
Xorth America" (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila , 1862, pp. 430-443), the 
family of Carongoids was limited, the chief snbfamilies defined, and one 
established, for the blue-fish and named " Pomatomina^," but the state- 
ment was made that "although the genus Pomatomus Lac. [Temnodon 
Cuv.) is here retained in the family, I am not certain that it truly be- 
longs to it" (p. 430). Two years later I proposed and defined a peculiar 
family for the genus. In the catalogue of the fishes of the eastern 
coast of North America, in 1873, it was intended to have been placed, 
as were all the families 60-65, among the Acauthopteri " incertre se- 
dis," but through some inadvertence the word " incerta' sedis " was 
omitted. In order to determine the affinities of the doubtful form, I 
have re-examined the fish and its skeleton, and. am now satisfied that 
the approximation of the type to the CarangidjE was correct, but still 
believe that it should be regarded as a peculiar family group. Pend- 
ing a more detailed comparative study of the Scombroids, this may be 
briefly diagnosed as follows :

The Epliippiids, although presenting a superficial resemblance to the 
Chfetodontids, otherwise exhibit such peculiarities as to have made me 
doubtful respecting their affinities, and to consider the family as iucer- 
ttie sedis. The post-temporal bones were found to be bifurcated and thus 
failed to fulfill the requisites of Professor Cope's suborder Epilasmia 
wherein the Chfetodontidse were arranged. To satisfy myself as to

their relatious, I have examiued their osteology, and am now convinced 
that, notwithstanding this deviation, they are most nearly connected 
with Chsetodonts. They exhibit the following external and skeletal 
characteristics.

Scales of small or moderate size, either very finely ciliated or smooth, 
covering the whole body and head, and encroaching on nninterruptedly 
and more or less investing the vertical fins. 

Lateral line continuous, paralhd with the back and ending at the base 
of the caudal fin. 

Head moderate, much compressed, short and high; eyes moderate, 
high and lateral, situated nearly midways between the snout and oc- 
ciput. 

Infraorbital chain with the bones decreasing backwards, and none 
articulated with the preperculum ; preorbital moderately developed. 

Opercular bones normal. 

Ilfostrils double. 

Mouth moderate, terminal, with the cleft lateral, scarcely extending 
to the vertical of the eyes. Upper jaw not or little protractile. 

Teeth setiform, in a band in each jaw ; none on the palate. 

Branchial apertures lateral and separated from each by a wi<le, .scaly 
isthmus. 

Branchiostegal rays seven on each side. 

Dorsal fin commencing some distance behind the nape, and thence 
extending nearly to the caudal; its spinous and soft jjortions are un- 
equally developed; spinous poi'tion highest about the third spine, and 
emarginated behind ; the soft long and elevated in front. 

Anal fin similar to and opposite the soft dorsal, and armed in front 
with three spines. 

Caudal fin expanded vertically and with its margin concave. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 559 

Pectoral tins normally situated on the scapular cincture, and with its 
lower rays branched. 

Ventral fins thoracic, each with a spine and five rays, the first or sec- 
ond of which is longest. 

The vertebrte number 24—10 abdominal and 14 candal; their bodies 
are compressed and higher than long. The first two are specially mod- 
ified : (1) The first has its central portion directed downwards, and its 
articularfacets for the exoccipitals nearly vertical and directed forwards; 
its spine fits into the second neural spine. (2.) The second vertebra 
has a very short body, compressed antero-posteriorly, and its spine is 
erect, and with the basal portion expanded forwards. The other verte- 
brie are gradually modified. 

The anterior zygapophyses are well developed, as are also the poste- 
rior of the caudal. vertebr?ej and about the middle the posterior partly 
overlap the anterior of the succeeding ; inferior zygapophyses are ru- 
dimentary ', the neurapophyses and neural spines arise direct from the 
anterior margins of the vertebra, and those of the middle of the column 
(e. </., 7 to 16) are erect, while the hindmost gradually decline back- 
wards; the parapophyses of the third to ninth vertebrae arise near the 
inferior surface of the vertebral bodies, are well developed, spiniform, 
and are all directed downwards and outwards, and partly (7 to 10) with a 
haimal canal ; those of the tenth are expanded at their base externally, 
and their i)oints converge and repose in the first htemal spine ; the first 
hffimal spine is grooved in front and somewhat expanded mesially. The 
sockets for the ribs are on the sides of the centra and at the external 
bases of the (third — eighth) parapophyses. 

These characters have been formulated on comparison of specimens in 
alcohol and skeletons of Chcctodipterus faber with those of Chretodon- 
tids, Serranids, Pristipomatids, &c. The resemblance to the Chaeto- 
donts (e- ry., Chwtodon or Fomacanthus lyaru) is much greater than to any 
other. Chcetodipterus differs from most fishes, and resembles the typical 
Chaitochmtids in the specialization of the two foremost vertebne, the 
great development of the parapophyses, and the inferior position of the 
sockets for the ribs. The. skull likewise resembles that of the Chieto- 
dontids in general characters, and especially in the oblique occipito- 
spheuoid axis and the development of the exoccipital condyles. In 
fine, the Ephippiids are very closely related to the Chaitodontids, but 
may be distinguished as follows: 

Cha^-todontoidea with a wide scaly isthmus extending fiom the pec- 
toral region to the chin and separating the branchial apertures ; spinous 
partially differentiated from the soft portion of the dorsal ; upper jaw 
scarcely protractile; ethmoid cariniform above (not sunk and concave) 
and vomer declivous (not projecting forwards or refuse), parapophyses 
spiniform and, posteriorly inclosing a htemal canal, and post-temporal 
bones bifurcated. 

Only two genera certainly belong to the family, Ephippus Cuv.

Among those families which :iie '' iticerta^ scdis" has been that desig- 
nated as LobotidiC. Its type — Loboies .'^Hri namensis—has been almost, 
universally placed with the Pristipomids except by American authors. 
There was, however, nothing in its physiognomy or characteristics, ex- 
cept the unarmed i)alate, to Justify such a reference, and recent examin- 
ation shows that the skepticism as to the propriety of such association 
was amply warranted. On the whole it appears to be most nearly re-

pauded forward and outward, and entering into the posterior borders 
of the orbits, which are advanced far forwards ; the post-frontals elong- 
ated forwards and underlying the frontalsj ethmoid short, decurved and 
expanded sideways. 

The abbreviated orbital and aute-orbital regions and ensuing modi- 
fications contrast strongly with the corresponding parts in all the forms 
with which the genus Lohotes has been associated. With the excep- 
tions noted, the vertebms are essentially similar to those of the Ser- 
ranidie. 

Lohotes is the only certainly known member of the family. 



!VOTE OIV THE RELiATIOIVSlIIP<^ OF THE ECHEIVEIDIDS. 
BY THEODORE OIEJL. 

Among those forms that have been most shifted from place to place 
in the ichthyological systems is the genus Echeneis of Artedi and Lin- 
naeus. 

By Artedi (1738) as well as by Linnreus, at first, it was placed in the 
order Malacopteeygii next to Coryphama, the last a true acanthop- 
terygian fish. 

By Linnaeus, in the later editions of the Systema ^^aturfe (1758, 176G), 
it was placed in the order Thoracici, but still kept by the side of 
Coryphcena. 

By Cuvier (1817) it was referred to the order of ''Malacopterygiens 
subbrachiens" and the family "Discoboles" after Lepadoyaster and 
Cyclopterus (E. A., t. 2, p. 227, 1817). 

By Swainson (Xat. Hist, and Class. Fishes, etc., v. 2, 1839) the genus 
Echeneis was raised to family rank and the family (Echeneidai) referred 
to the order '^Acauthopteryges" and the tribe "Microleptes," in which 
it was supposed to constitute an "aberrant family" (p. 30), which "rep- 
resented" the Acanthopterygian "tribe Blennides" (p. 32) and the 
"order Apodes" (p. 31). 

It was preceded by the "typical" Tamilies (1) " Scomberidse " and (2) 
"Zeidaj," and followed by the "aberrant" families (4) "Centriscidge" 
and (5) "Coryiihajuidaj." 

Subsequently all reference to the family as well to the genus was 
omitted (apparently through forgetful u ess) by Swainson in the later 
and synoptical portion of the work. His eccentric classification is only 
noticed here because a similar or still more extreme view as to the afiin- 
ity of the genus became long afterwards quite ])revalent. 

By Miiller (1844) the genus was put in the order Acanthopteri and in 
the family Cyclopodi, but as the representative of a peculiar "group" 
("3. Gruppe. Echeneiden").

562 PJIOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

By Agassiz aud Holbrook, aud later by Glintlier* (1860), it was trans- 
ferred to the family Scombridie, next to Elacate. 

By Bleeker (1859) the genus was entitled with family rank (Echenoi- 
dei) and also ordinally distinguished (with the name "ordo 38. Disco- 
cephali") and interposed between "ordo 37. Fistulariae," and "ordo 39. 
Cyclopteri." 

By Cope (1870) it has been retained next to some Scombroid fishes 
(the Carangidae), but as a distinct family, and placed in his order " Per- 
comorphi" and suborder "Distegi." 

In later years the views of Miiller, and subsequently of Swainsou and 
Giinther, have been generally adopted hj European ichthyologists. In 
my "Arrangement of the families of fishes" the family Echeneididse has 
been relegated to the categorj^ of Teleocephali " incertce sedis.^^ A de- 
sire to reach some defiuite conclusion has induced me to examine its 
osteological as well as other characteristics, and has resulted in the fol- 
lowing conclusions : 

The ventral fins being furnished with true spines, the fish is not a 
Malacopterygian, but an Acanthopterygian of Artedi, Cuvier, etc. The 
opposite reference to the Malacopterygians was due, in the first place, 
to the failure of Artedi and the older naturalists to appreciate the ditter- 
ence between slender spines and "soft rays," and subsequently to the 
assumption, without attempt at verification, by Cuvier, of the correct- 
ness of his predecessors' statements. 

The "basis cranii" is not double but simple, and there is no "tube." 
The type, therefore, is not at all related to the Scombridae, Carangidae, 
and other typical fishes, and consequently does not belong to the sub- 
order "Distegi" of Cope. 

The contrary statement implied by Professor Cope is due, doubtless, 
to the preoccupation of his mind with the idea as to the affinity claimed 
to exist between Echeneis and the Scombridae, and the consequent as- 
sumption that the former had a hasis cranii like the latter. Inasmuch 
as the cranial cavity is partly closed, the true state of affairs can only 
be seen on opening or bisecting the skull, and this has probably been 
neglected. The group would really be referable to the suborder Scypho- 
branchii in Professor Cope's system, were it not for the form of the third 
pair of upper pharyngeal bones. 

But what could have been the reason for referring the fish to the 
family Scombridae (as contradistinguished from the Carangidae) as a 
simple genus? 

The family of " Scomberoides" was constituted by Cuvier for certain 
forms of known organization, among which were fishes evidently related 
to Caranx, but which had free dorsal spines. In the absence of knowl- 
edge of its structure, the genus Elacaie was approximated to such be- 
cause it also had free dorsal spines. Dr. Giinther conceived the idea

of disiutegTating- this family, because, infer alias, the typical Scombe- 
roides (family Scombridse) had more than twenty-four vertebrse and <;thers 
(family Carangidae) had just 24. The assumption of Cu\ier as to the 
relationship of Elacate was repeated, but inasmuch as it has " more than 
24 vertebrse" (it has 25 = 12 + 13) it was severed from the free-spined 
Carangidse* and associated with the Scombridse. Elacate has an elon- 
gated body, flattish head, and a colored longitudinal lateral band ; 
Echeneis has also an elongated body, flattened head, and a longitudinal 
lateral band ; therefore Eclieneis was considered to be next allied to 
Elacate and to belong to the same family ! The very numerous differ- 
ences in structure between the two were en^rely ignored, and the refer- 
ence of Echeneis to the Scombridse is simply due to assumption piled 
on assumption. The collocation need not, therefore, longer detain us. 
The possession by Eclieneis of the anterior oval cephalic disk in place 
of a spinous dorsal fin would alone necessitate the isolation of the 
genus as a peculiar family. But that difference is associated with 
almost innumerable other peculiarities of the skeleton and other 
parts, and in a logical system it must be removed far from the Scom- 
bridse, and probably be endowed with subordinal distinction. In all 
essential respects it departs greatly from the type of structure mani- 
fested in the Scombroidea and rather approximates — but very distantly 
— the Gobioidea and Blennioidea. In those types we have in some a 
tendency to flattening of the head, or anterior development of the dor- 
sal fin, a simple basis cranii, etc. Nevertheless there is no close affinity 
nor even any tendency to the extreme modification of the spinous dorsal 
exhibited by Eclieneis. In view of all these facts Eclieneis, with it sub- 
divisions, may be regarded as constituting not only a family but a 
suborder, which is definable as follows :

Scales, cycloid, very small, and not or scarcely imbricated. 

Lateral line nearly straight and very faint. 

Head above oblong- and with a flattened straight upper surface fur- 
nished with an adhesive oblong or elongated laminated disk. The eyes 
are rather small, submedian, and overhung by the disk. 

Suborbital bones forming a slender infraorbital chain; the first or 
preorbital triangular and thick. 

Opercular apparatus normally developed and unarmed. 

Nostrils double, close together. 

3Iouth terminal or, rather, superior, the lower jaw projecting, but 
with the cleft nearly horizontal and not extending laterally to the eyes. 

Teeth present on the jaws and palate. 

Branchial apertures ample and fissured forwards. Branchiostegal 
rays seven (or eight) on each side. 

The adhesive disk on the upper surface of the head is a modified first 
dorsal fin and from the snout generally extends more or less posteriorly 
on the nape and back 5 it is oblong or elongated and of an oval or ellip- 
tical form, divided into equal halves by a longitudinal septum, and with 
more or less numerous transverse pectinated or spiuigerous transverse 
laminte in each division, the laminae being slightly erectile and depres- 
sibie. 

Dorsal fin oblong or elongated, on the posterior half of the body 
(including head), ending some distance from the caudal. 

Anal fin opposite and similar to the dorsal. 

Caudal fin rather small, variable in outline but never deeply forked. 

Pectoral fins moderate, inserted high on the sides. 

Ventral fins thoracic ; each with a spine and five branched rays. 

The vertebral column has vertebrae in slightly increased number, the 
abdominal vertebrae being about twelve to fourteen and the caudal fif- 
teen or sixteen. 

The stomach is ciecal and the pyloric caeca are present in moderate 
numbers. The air bladder is obsolete. 

Who can consistently object to the proposition to segregate the 
Echeneididae as a suborder of teleocephalous fishes ? 

iiTot those who consider that the development of three or four inar- 
ticulated rays (or even less) in the front of the dorsal fin is sulficient to 
ordinally diflerentiate a given form from another with only one or two 
such. Certainly the difference between the constituents of a disk and 
any rays or spines is much greater than the mere development or atro- 
phy of articulations. 

Xot those who consider that tfie manner of depression of spines, 
whether directly over the following, or to the right and left alternately, 
are of ordinal importance; for such diftereuces again are manifestly of 
less morphological siguificance than the factors of a suctorial disk. 

Xevertheiess there are doubtless many who will passively resist the 
proposition because of a conservative spirit, and who will vaguely recur

to the development of tlie disk as being- a " teleological modification," 
and as if it were not an actual fact and a development correlated with 
radical modifications of all parts of the skeleton at least. 

But whatever may be the closest relations of JEcheneis, or the system- 
atic value of its peculiarities, it is certain that it is not allied to Macate 
any more than to others of the hosts of Scombroid, Percoid, and kin- 
dred fishes, and that it differs in toto from it, notwithstanding the claims 
that have been made otherwise.* It is true there is a striking re- 
semblance, especially between the young — almost as great, for example, 
as that between the i^lacental mouse and the marsupial antechinomys — 
but the likeness is entirely superficial, and the scientific ichthyologist 
should be no more misled in the case than would the scientific therolo- 
gist by the likeness of (he marsupial and placental mammals. 



NOTE OIV THE GENUS SPARIJS. 

BY THEODORE OILE. 

Messrs. Jordan and Gilbert propose to restore the Linnsean name 
Spams to Sparus hoops, after the example of Swainson (Nat. Hist, and 
Class. Fishes, etc., v. 2, i^p. 171, 221), instead of to the Sparus aurata, as I 
have done. This course is inadmissible, as those naturalists will doubt- 
less recognize when they become conversant with the facts of the case. 

Linnaeus, after Artedi and the older authors, employed the name for 
Sparoid and other fishes of diverse kinds, and including Sjmms aurata, 
Sparus hoops, etc. Both Artedi and Linnaeus placed the S. aurata at the 
head or as first of the genus. 

Bloch and Lac6pMe variously restricted the genus, but still retained 
the forms just noted. 

Cuvier, ill 1817, subdivided the old genus into "tribes" and "genera," 
distinguishing for the Siiarus hoops, etc., the " second tribe," and the 
genus "Boops Cuv.," and for the Sjjarus aurata and related forms the 
"third tribe" and the restricted genus "Sparus Cuv." The "genus" 
was subdivided into subgenera, viz: "Les Sargues (Sargus. Cuv.)," "les 
Daurades" (without a latin equivalent), and "les Pagres (Pagrus. Cuv.)." 

The name Sjyar^ts must, therefore, be retained for a section of the 
genus as restricted by Cuvier. 

Risso, in 1827, supplied a Latin name "Aurata " for " les Daurades" 
of Cuvier. 

Cuvier, in 1829, retained the genus^ Sparus with the same limits as in 
1817, but with a slightly different subdivision of subgenera, viz : " Les 
Sargues (Sargus)," "les Daurades (Chrysophris K.)," "les Pagres" 
(without a Latin name), and "les Pagels (Pagellus Cuv.)." 

*"This genus [Echcneisi is closely allied to the preceding lEIacate}, from which it 
differs only by the transformation of the spinons dorsal rin into a sucking organ." 
(aunther, Int. to Study of Fishes," p. 460, 1880.) 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 567 

Bonaparte, in 1832, revived the uame Sparus — "Spams N. (Aurata 
Eiss., Chrysoplirys C.)," for the iSpartis aurata. 

For the Sparus aurata and its relations, the Linnsean name must there- 
fore be retained and the subsequent applications of the name in no wise 
affect the legitimacy of this application. 

Whether the groups designated as Fagrus and Chrysoplirys are, or are 
not, geuerically distinct is not a matter for present consideration. It is 
certain, however, that the group as proposed by Cuvier, and adopted 
by later writers (e. g., Giinther), is artificial and heterogeneous, and 
doubtless the typical species of Chrysoplirys and Fagrus are more nearly 
allied to each other than are such types to forms with which they have 
been associated. For tlie present, the genus Sparus may be retained as 
distinct from Fagrus and with the eliminations required.

OX THE PROPER IVAME OF THE RLTTE FISH. 

BY THEODORE OIEE. 

The propriety of the substitution of the name Fomatomus in place of 
Temnodon for the blue-fish of the Americans has been questioned by (1) 
those who contend that a generally accepted name should not be dis- 
turbed, and by (2) those who would go to an extreme in the applica- 
tion of the law of priority. A brief history of the nomenclature of the 
genus seems therefore to be desirable. 

The blue-fish had been referred to genera with which it has little 
affinity (to Gasterosteus by Linnaeus and Scomber by Bloch) till the close 
of the last century. 

In 1802 Lacepede described as a new species, and as the first of a new 
genus, a form which was evidently identical with the Gasterosteus salta- 
trix of Linnseus and the blue-fish of the United States, but which was 
obtained by Commerson in the " Oc6an Equatorial." With this species 



568 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

were associated eight others and the includiug genus was defined as 
follows : 

" Cent sixieme f/enre. 

" LES CHEILODIPTi:EES. 

''La levre superieure extensible ; point de dents incisives, ni molares j 
les opercules des branchies deuues de piquans et de dentelures ; deux 
nageoires dorsales." 

In 1828, the genus Cheilodiptenis was amended by Cuvier and Valen- 
ciennes (Hist. Xat. des Poissons, t. 2, p.l62), and restricted to the third 
species of Lacepkle (le C. rayc) and related species. Inasmuch as (1) 
the Cuvieriau genus had received no previous name, (2) the Lacepediau 
name and diagnosis were as applicable to it as to any other of the spe- 
cies, and (3) it did not conflict with any other rights, there appears to 
be no sufficient reason for transferring the name to any other genus. 
Nevertheless, because the first species of the genus was the Blue-fish, 
Dr. Bleeker has proposed to revive the name Cheilodiptertis instead of 
Temnodon^ and given a new name [Paramia) for the genus Cheilodij)- 
terus Cuv. & Yal. ex Lac. Common usage does not seem to justify such 
a procedure. 

But in 1803 Lacepede described a supposed i^reviously unknown form 
of fish, the Pomatome skib {Fomatomus sMh), in the following terms :

As this description clearly applies to the ordinary bluefish, and, in 
fact, is well known to be based on that species, the name Pomatomus 
should have been used for it as the earliest given thereior. But Eisso, 
in 182G, referred to Lacepede's genus, a deep-sea fish, which he consid- 
ered to be congeneric with the " P. sldb:^ Cuvier recognized that Risso's 
fish was generically distinct, but notwithstanding (1) revived the name 
Pomatomus from Eisso for the latter fish, (2) suppressed Lacepedes genus, 
and (3) proposed a new designation {Temnodon) in place of Lacepede's 
Pomatomus. Each step in this procedure was inadmissible. In 1862, I 
therefore restored the name Pomatomus to the bluefish in lieu of Temno- 
don and this revived name has been generally adopted since by American 
naturalists, as it undoubtedly will be by all others when they have 
learned that obedience to law (laws formulated by the British and Amer- 
ican Associations for the Advancement of Science) is more conducive to 
stability of nomenclature than deference to the whiui or prejudice of 
any " authority." 

The synonymy of the genus is quite voluminous, as will be evident 
from the following exhibit :

DOES THE PANTHER (FELIS CONCOIOR) GO INTO THE WATER TO KILL FISH 1 
BY I.IVIWGSTOI\ STOWE. 

[Letter to Prof. S. F. Baird.] 

My mind has been quite exercised lately on the question whether 
panthers go into the water to kill fish. They are so numerous and bold 
here this year, that they come to our very doors and kill pigs and fowls 
under our windows. We estimate that they have killed a hundred dol- 
lars' worth of hogs here this season, besides calves, colts, and full grown 
cattle and horses. As far as boldness is concerned, they are fully equal 
to jumping into our trout ponds and killing our trout. And if you think 
they are likely to do this, we will take special precautions against it. 
They easily jump over any obstacle not more than 15 feet high, so that 
our fences are no protection from them. 

They frequently swim the river, which made me think that perhaps 
they might get into the trout ponds sometimes for a meal of fish.

OIV CERTAIIV l\X:Or,E:CTE:i> OEIVERIC XAMES of I.A CEPl^DE. 
BY DAVID S. JORDAIV AND CHARLES H. GILBERT. 

In the Histoire Naturelle des Poissons (1799-1803) of La Cepede a con- 
siderable number of generic names are proposed, some of them founded 
on errors of various sorts, others properly defined. About one-fourth of 
these were adopted by Cuvier and Valenciennes, and have come into 
general use. A large number are simple synonyms. The remainder, 
for diftereut reasons, were set aside by Cuvier and Valenciennes, and 
new names proposed in their places. As the laws of priority are con- 
stantly becoming more and more urgent, we find ourselves obliged to 
go behind Cuvier, and to adopt these earlier names. 

The present paper contains a discussion of some of these names, the 
adoption of which would affect the nomenclature of American fishes.

Hiatula. 12. L. piuua auali nulla. Br. 5, D. H, P. 16, V^. A. 0. C. 21. 

Habitat in Carolina, /a«cii.s nigris, G-7 pictu8. D. Garden. Labium retractile, iutus 
rugosum; dentes inmandibuHslaniarii, in palaio orMculati ; brancMarum ojjercu htm aw- 
teriui< margine punctatum; pinna dorsalis fere JongituditiaUs, radiis sinnosis cequalilws, 
posterius nigra. 

With the exception of the two characters, absence of the anal fin, and 
presence of rounded teeth on the palate, which belong to no fish of this 
type, this description applies well to a young tautog, and to no other 
fish which Dr. Garden could have obtained at Charleston. The speci- 
men most likely was one in which the anal fin had been bitten off, an acci- 
dent to which fishes are not unfrequently subject. The rounded teeth 
on the palate must be either the posterior teeth of the premaxillaries, 
which are bluntish, or possibly the papillae w^hich cover the membrane 
before the vomer. 

In the second volume of La Cepede's work (ii, 522, 1800), this species 
appears under the name of Hiatula gardeniana, as the type of a new ge- 
nus, Hiatula, distinguished from Labrus by the absence of the anal fin. 

As this character was merely the accident of a mutilated specimen, 
this genus is a virtual synonym of Labrus, and by many writers would 
be suppressed as such. The name Hiatula, however, stands on the same 
footing as that of Micropterus, which was likewise based by La Cepede 
on a mutilated fish. As Micropterus has now come into general use, we 
suggest that Hiatula be substituted for Taiitoga. 

2. GOBIOMORUS. 

The genus Gohiomorus was proposed by La Cej)ede (Hist. Nat. Poiss. 
ii, ."iSS, 1800) as a subdivision of the Linusean genus Gobius, with the 
following definition : 

"Les deux nageoires thoracines nou reunies I'une a I'autre; deux 
nageoires dorsales: la tete petite; les yeux rapproches ; les opercules 
attaches dans une graude partie de leur contour." 

In definition and in intention, this group corresponds to the genus 
JSleotris of Bloch and Schneider, as revised and restricted by Cuvier, 
for Bloch and Schneider seemed to have no clear idea of the group, and 
very few of the species referred by them to Meotris are related to Meotris 
gyrinus. 

Four species are referred by La Cepede to Golnomorus, viz, G. gronovii 
{=yomeus gronovii (Gmeliu) C. & Y.) G. taihoa {=Eleotris strigata 
(Broussonet) C. & V.) G. dormitor Lac. (later called Platyeeplialus dormi-

tator by Block & Schneider =:P/il7^/29>^^^s• donnitator (Lac.) C. & Y.) aud G. 
Imireuteri {=P€rioplitlialmus Imlreuteri (Gmoliti) Blocli & Schneider). 

Of these species, the first, (jronovii has no rehition to Gohius, and 
does not correspond to the definition of Gobiomorus, as the gill mem- 
branes are free from the istlimns. Its association with the Gobies is an 
error which originated with (Imelin. It may therefore be omitted from 
consideration. The remaining aiodern genera included in GoMomorus, 
viz, Eleotris Bioch & Schneider, 1801 (Subgenus Valenciennea Bleeker, 
ISoG), FMhjpnus Guv. & Yal., 1837, and Periophihalntus Bloch & Schnei- 
der, 1801, are all subsequent to Gobiomorus, and in place of one of them 
the latter name must be retained. It has not as yet been restricted by 
any author, so far as we know. It seems to us best to consider as the 
type of Gobiomorus^ G. dormitafor LaCepede, and therefore to use the 
name Gobiomorus instead of Philt/pnus. A serions practical objection 
to the consideration of taiboa {sfriyatus) as the type of Gobiomorus lies in 
the uncertainty whether this species is really congeneric with Eleotris 
gijrinns, (which species must, we think, as ^'■Eleotris ^nsonis," be consid- 
ered the type of Eleotris). In Bleeker's system, strigatus is made the 
type of a distinct genus ( Valenciennea Bleeker) and j)laced at a distance 
from Eleotris, but no diagnostic features of importance have been made 
known by which it may be distinguished. 

3. GOBIOMOROIDES. 

The genus Gobiomoroides was proposed by La Cepede (Hist. Xat. 
Poiss., ii., 592, 1800)' with a definition identical \\\th. that of Gobiomorus 
except that "uue seule nageoire dorsale" is substituted for "deux 
nageoires dorsales." Its type is Gobiomoroides piso La Cepede, a 
species which is considered by La Cqpede identical with Gobius pisonis 
Gmelin, the '■'■Eleotris''^ of Gronow. 

Gobius pisonis Gmelin is identified by Cuvier & Valenciennes with 
Eleotris (/ijrinus, with considerable doubt, however, as the descriptions 
and figures of the former species are both incomplete aud erroneous. 
The identity is probably too doubtful to w^arrant the use of the specific 
nnme pisonis for (jyrinus. La Cepede's description of G. piso, is, however, 
nottakenfromGmelin,butfromadriedfish " given by Bollaud to France.'' 
This.j>pecimen has 45 rays in the dorsal which is continuous, 23 in the 
anal, and the lower jaw has a series of canines besides the cardiform 
baud. Whatever this fish may be, it is not an Eleotris, and the name 
Gobiomoroides cannot be used for Eleotris gyrinus, even if it be shown 
that this species is identical with Gobius pisonis Gmelin. 

4. KYPHOSUS. 

The genera Kypliosus (La Cepede, Hist. Nat. Poiss., iii, 114, 1802), 
Pimelepterus (1. c. iv., 429, 1803) : Dorsuarius (1. c. v., 482, 1803), and 
Xyster (1. c. v. 484, 1803), are identical, as has been shown by Cuvier 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 573 

aud Valencienues, vii, 254. The earliest of these uames should be used, 
and Kyphosus should therefore supersede PimeJepterus. The word should 
however be spelled with an initial C, as Cypliosus. 

5. MONODACTYLUS. 

The genera, Monodactylus La Cei)ede (Hist. Nat. Poiss.,iii, 131, 1802, 
M. falciformis Lac), CentropodusJ^a Cepede (iii, 303, C. rhomheusIjaG.). 
and AcantJiopus (iv, 558 ; A. argenteus (Gmelin) and A. Boddcvrti (Gmelin) ) 
are all based on species of the genus afterwards called Psettus Cuv. 
& Val. This genus should therefore receive thenaiueofi¥oHO(7ac#^/?^6'. 

G. SCOMBEROMORUS. 

Scomheromorus (iii. 293 ; S. plumierii La Cep.) is based on a dra wing- 
by Plumier. The genus is distinguished from Scomber by the supposed 
continuity of the dorsal tins, a fallacious character. The species is iden- 
tical with Scomber regalis Bloch, and the name Scomberomorus, if ac- 
cepted, must supersede Cybium Cuv. & Val. 

7. OEPHALACANTHUS. 

It appears to be reasonably certain that the small fishes which have 
received the name of Cephalacantlms La C. (iii, 323, 1802 ; C. spinareUa 
L.) are the young of, or, at least, not generically different from, the Flying 
Ournards {Bactylopterus La C. iii, 325). The name GepliaJacanthus has 
two pages priority, and should in strictness supersede Bactylopterus. 
The application of the law of priority to different parts of the same work 
is often as important for the avoidance of confusiou as its application 
to different works. The law of primogeniture applies to twins. 

8. DIPTERODON. 

The genus Dipterodon La C. (Ilist. Xat. Poiss., iv, 1G5, 1803) is based 
on six species, mostly nnrelated, belonging to Lutjanus, Apogon^ Aspro, 
and Sckena. The first of this species, I>. plumieri^ is identical with 
Lutjanus synagris, and the name may be considered as a synonym of 
Lutjanus. 

The sixth species mentioned, " IJipterodon chryso^irus,''^ is evidently 
identical with Sckena argyroleuca (Mitch.), the second of the two species 
called '■'■Perca punctata " by Linnieus in the Systema Natu'rte. If the 
duplicated Linntean name be restricted to the first species to which it was 
given {Ep'meplielus punctatus), the name clirysura mnst take the place of 
argyroleuca., and the species stand as Scicmia {Bairdiella) clirysura. 

The name Dipterodon has been used by Cuv. & Val. for a genus un- 
known to La Cepede. This transfer of the name is not allowable, and 
the Dipterodon C. «& V. should receive a different name, that of Cora- 
cinus Gronow (1854). 



574 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



9. CH^TODIPTERUS. 

Ghcetodipterus (iv., 503; Glicetodon plumieri^ Gmeliu.) is correctly dis- 
tinguished from Chcetodon, by the separation of the dorsal fins. Its type 
is identical with Zeusfaher Broussonet. The name Chcetodipterus must 
therefore supersede ParepMppus Gill, as Bleeker has already shown. 

10. POMADASYS. 

Pomadasys (iv. 515) is based on Scimia argentea Forskai, which is a 
species of Cuvier's genus Pristipoma, according to Giinther and Cuvier. 

The generic description is not altogether correct, but is copied from 
the specific description of Forskiil. The name Pomadasys must there- 
fore take the place of Pnstipoma, a change already made by Cantor and 
Bleeker. 

11. clupa:n^odox. 

The genus Clupanodon was proposed by La Cepede (Hist. Nat. Poiss., 
V. 468, 1803) for those species of Glupea which had no teeth in the 
jaws, and with the following definition : 

" Plus detrois rayons a la membrane des branchies, le ventre carene; 
la carene du ventre dentelee on tres-aigus; la nageoire de I'anus separee 
de celle de la queue ; une seule nageoire sur le dos ; point de dents 
aux machoires." 

Six species are referred by La Cepede to this genus, viz : 

thrissa (L.). {Opisthonema Gill.) 

nasicaliSkC. {nasus Bloch). {Dorosonia Raf.) 

pilchardm L. {Sardinia Poey.) 

sinensis L. {Glupeonia C. & V.) 

africanus Bloch. {Pellona, C. & V.) 

jussieu liac. [Glupeonia Q.&.Y.) 

One of these, Pellona africana^ does not conform to the definition and 
should be excluded. All the others (except Dorosoma nasus) are very 
closely related, and are probably all representatives of sections of the 
genus Glupea rather than of distinct genera. The name of Glupanodon 
is prior to all of these and must take the place of one of them. So far 
as we know, it has never been formally restricted. It seems to us best 
to consider G.jussieui as the type of Glupanodon, and to substitute 
Clupanodon for Glupeonia. 

12. GYMNOMUE^NA. 

The genus Gymnomurcena La O^pede (Hist. ITat. Poiss., v. 618, 1803), 
was defined as follows : 

" Point de nageoires pectorales ; une ouverture branchiale sur chaque 
c6t6 du poisson ; le corps et la queue presque cylindriques ; point de 
nageoire du dos, ni de nngeoire de I'anus; ou ces deux nageoires si 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 575 

basses et si envelopp^es dans une peau epaisse, qu'on ne pent reconnoi- 
tre leur presence que par la dissection." 

Two species are mentioned, Gymnomurwna doliata La C. {=Ecliidna 
zebra (Shaw) Bleeker) and Gymnomur(jena marmorata {=Murcenoble7ina 
marmorata), both of whicli agree fairly with the generic definition. 

The first restriction of the genus Gymnomurcena is that of Kaup (Apo- 
des, 1856, 103), in which zebra (doliata) is regarded as the type ; and 
the group is recognized (probably correctly) as distinct from Echidna 
Forster {=Poecilo])Ms, Kaup). 

Later Dr. Giinther (Cat. Fish, Brit. Mus., viii, 133, 1870) has restricted 
the name Gymnomurwna to the second species of La Cepede [marmorata). 
This arrangement seems to us not allowable. The first proper restric- 
tion must hold, and the name Gymuoniurcena henceforth go with G. do- 
liata. 

13. MUE^NOBLENXA. 

The group called by Dr. Giinther Gymnomurcena should stand as Mu- 
rcenoblenna La Cepede (Hist. Nat. Poiss., v. 652, 1803). This genus is 
based on a single species, M. olivacea La C, and is defined as follows : 

" Point de nageoires pectorales ; point d'apparence d'autres nageoires ; 
le corps et la queue presque cylindriques 5 la surface de I'animal repan- 
dant en tres grande abandance, une humeur* laiteuse et gluante." 

14. MACEORHAMPHOSUS. 

The genus MacrorhampJiosus La Cepede (v. 136) is based on Silurus 
eornutus ¥oTskM= Centriscus scolopaxh. In the tenth edition of the 
Systema Naturae, Linnseus refers to his genus Centriscus but one spe- 
cies, G. scutatus. This species should, therefore, properly be taken as 
the type of Centriscus {=Amp1iisile Cuv.), while the name Macrorham- 
phosus should be used for G. scolopax and its relatives, the group usually 
called Centriscus. 

The following is a summary of the changes in nomenclature suggested 
in the present paper : 

HiATULALa Cepede for Tautoga Mitchill. 
GoBiOMORUs La Cepede for Fliilypnus Cuv. & Val. 
Cyphosus La C6pede for Pimelepterus La C6pede.

ON THE SVIVONVillY OF THE GEIVIS BOTHIJS BAFIIVESQUE. 
BY DAVID S. JORDAN AISD CHARI^ES H. OII.B£RT. 

In the Caratteri di Alcuui Kuovi Geueri, etc., 1810, 23, the geuus 
Bothus is established by Rafinesque for flounders, which are allied to the 
European turbot. Three species are referred to this genus : B. rumoJo 
Raf., B. tappa Raf., and B. i))i2)erialis Raf. The first of these is, according to 
Bonaparte (Cat. Metod. dei Pesci Europ., 1840,49) identical with Pleu- 
ronectes rhombus L. ; the third, with the Turbot PL maximus L., and the 
second has not yet, so far as we know, been identified. The relations of 
these fishes to the Linnneau PL rhombus seems to have understood by 
Rafinesque,who observes that he should have called the genus Bhombus, 
had not La Cepede removed the latter name to another genus. It will 
be, therefore, not unfair to take the first species mentioned by Rafin- 
esque, and which is really identical with Pleuronectes rhombusli.j as the 
type of his geuus Bothus. A group substantially identical with this 
had been previously outlined by Klein under the jiame of Bhombus. 
This name was afterwards accepted by Cuvier for the Turbot and its rel- 
atives, and has now come into general use. If we adopt the pre-Lin- 
nsean and non binomial generic names proposed by Klein, as has been 
done by Bleeker, and formerly by Professor Gill, the name Rhombus 
must be used for this group. If we reject these pre-Liuntean names, as 
is now the custom of most writers, the Rhombus of Cuvier is antedated 
by Rhombus of La Cepede { = P€j)rilus Cuvier), and moreover, it is not 
the earliest name of the group in question. 

In the Indice d' Ittiologia Siciliaua, 1810, j). 53, a few months later 
than the "Caratteri," a genus "■ Scophthabmis-'' is thus defined: "Ale 
giugulari ed ale caudale sciolte, occhj alia sinistra." 

Three species are referred to this genus (p. 14) : Pleuronectes maxi- 
mus L., Pleuronectes rhombus, L., and a new species based on an erro- 
neous and indeterminable figure of Rondelet, which receives the name 
of Sco2)hthalmus diurns. Rafinesque's geuus Scojyhthalmus is therefore 
equivalent to his own Bothus, the sole difference between them being, 
according to Bonaparte (1. c, p. 49), that Bothus was founded ou actual 
specimens ("ex natur") and Scophthalmns on the descriptions of others 
("ex auct"). 

Later, as already stated, both these fishes, with others, received the 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 577 

a name not tenable under the rules of nomenclature 
followed by us. 

In 1839 the genus Psettawds proposed by Swainson (Kat. Hist. Classn. 
Fishes, etc., ii, 302) in the following words : 

" Psetta Aristotle,* Guv. — Body rhomboidal ; dorsal fin commencing at 
the edge of the upper jaw, and extending, as well as the anal, almost to 
the caudal ; eyes approximating, with a short, crest-like cirrus. 

" P. MAXiMUS, Bloch, pi. 49." 

This name Psetta is adopted by Bonaparte (Catalogo Metodico di 
Pesci Europei, 1846, 49) for the entire group called Rhombus by Cuvier, 
while the name Bothus is transferred to a different genus which had 
been previously called Platoplirys by Swainson, and later Rliomhoidich- 
thys by Bleeker. The name Scophtkahnus is likewise diverted from its 
original meaning, and is used for the genus previously named Zeugop- 
terus by Gottsche. 

In 1862 (Proc. Acad. ISTat. Sci., Phila. 1862, 216) an American species 
{Pleuronectes maculatvs, Mitchill) which, from any point of view, is strictly 
congeneric with Pleuronectes rhombus L., was recognized by Professor 
Gill as the type of a distinct genus {Lophopsetta Gill). In 1882 (Syn. 
Fish. N". Am., 815) the present writers have referred this species to the 
genus Bothus, recognizing as the type of Bothus, Bothus rumolo Eaf., 
= Pleuronectes rhombus, L. 

Whether the extremely rudimentary or obsolete condition of the scales 
of Pleuronectes waajiwwsL., justifies its separation from Bothus as a dis- 
tinct genus we are not yet prepared to say. At present we may regard 
it as the representative of a distinct subgenus, for which the name 
Psetta must apparently be retained. The three species noticed in the 
present paper may therefore stand as 

1. Bothus fBothusJ rhombus (L.). 

2. Bothus (Bothus) maculatus (Mitch.). 

3. Bothus (Psetta) maximus (L.).

578 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

General form of A. notospilotus, the body rather robust; the head 
large and broad. Lower jaw included. Maxillary extending to poste- 
rior part of eye, 2\ in head. Eyes rather large, 5 in head, about one- 
third broader than the concave interorbital space. Nasal spines strong, 
with a conspicuous cirrus behind them. Top of head less depressed 
and less concave than in A. notospilotus ; its lateral ridges smooth and 
covered by skin, without spine-like projections. No tubercular promi- 
nences behind eye. Preopercle ending in a short process, which has 
usually three spines at its tip, the two uppermost hooked upward. 
The three prominences below this spine are small, entire, covered with, 
smooth skin. (In A. notospilotus these projections are much larger, and 
more or less coarsely serrate.) A few small dermal flaps on top and 
sides of head. Head with small stellate, non-imbricate scales, arranged 
much as in A. notospilotus, but extending lower on the sides of the head, 
covering the suborbital and postorbital regions, as far down as the sub- 
orbital stay. Scales on body cup-shaped, arranged, as in A. notospilotus, 
in a broad band along each side of the back; each band about 9 scales 
in breadth. This band extends much further back than in A. notospi- 
lotus, meeting its fellow across the back of the tail behind the dorsal 
fin. A small but distinct pore-like slit behind the fourth gill (wholly 
wanting in A. notospilotus). 

Fins low, the dorsal much lower than in A. notospilotus; the longest 
dorsal spine about equal to snout ; 3J in head (in the female), probably 
higher i^ the males. Yentrals about reaching vent; pectorals past 
front of anal. 

Color, in spirits, essentially as in A. notospilotus, bat paler ; olivaceous, 
the head mottled and barred with blackish ; back with about 4 saddle- 
like black bars. Base of caudal blackish. Fins all, except the ventrals, 
which are pale (i>robably dusky in males), with cross-bars and series of 
spots. A black blotch bordered by orange between iirst and second 
dorsal spines, and another between 7th and 8th. 

This species is evidently the northern representative of Artedius no- 
tospilotus, but has apparently become so thoroughly differentiiited from 
the latter as to be worthy of a distinct spocitic name. In A. notospilotus, 
the head is more uneven, the body and head less completely scaled, the 
fins larger, the armature of the i)reopercle different, and especially 
there is no trace of slit behind the last gill. 

Several specimens of this species were obtained by the writers in 
Commencement Bay, near New Tacoma, Washington Territory, in 
June, 1880. These are numbered 27206 and 2714G, and some of them 
have been distributed by the National Museum as ^^ Artedius notospi- 
lotus.^^ The latter species was found by us in abundance only at Santa 
Barbara. Girard's original types apparently included both species, but 
his description applies best to the southern form. 

If we include in the §^eni\s Artedius a.\\ the species {lateralis, fenestra- 
lis, notospilotus, quadriscriatus, j)U(jctfensis, me(iacephalus) from the west

coast of the TJiiited States, which have been referred to it, it becomes 
practically impossible to separate it from the genus Icelus of Kroyer. 
Some of the different members of Ar/erfw/s are more like Icelus hmnatus 
than they are like each other. At present we are unable to draw any 
satisfactory dividing line among these species, and elsewhere (Syn. 
Fish. N. A., 689) we have referred all of them to Icelus. In the same 
memoir we have mentioned the specimens which here become the types 
of A. fenestralis as " Northern si^ecimens," rejoresenting " a marked 
variety" of Icelus notospilotus.

Four weeks during the UK^nlhs of -htly and August, 188'-', were spent 
by Mr. Gilbert in collecting and studying the tishes of Charleston and 
vicinity in the interests of the United States National Museum. One 
hundred and twcntj-three species of marine tishes were observed; of 
these twenty one had not been previously recorded froiu our South At- 
lantic coast, nineteen being additions from the West Indies and the 
Gulf of Mexico.

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 581 

Especial acknowledgments are due to Mr. Charles C. Leslie for aid 
of various kinds rendered Mr. Gilbert while in Charleston. It was only 
through his co-oj^eration that the present collection was made possible. 
Dr. G. E. Manigault kindly gave free access to the collections in the 
museum of Charleston College, and also presented several interesting 
specimens. 

1. Ginglymostoma cirratum (Gmel.) Miiller aud Henle. 

A stuffed skin of this species, about 5 feet long, is in the Charleston 
Museum. 

2. Mustelus canis (Mitch.) De Kay. 

A single specimen seen ; probably not common. 

3. ScoUodon terraenovae (Rich.) Gill. 
Very abundant in the harbor. 

4. Sphyrna tiburo (Linn.) Raf. — Sho^Jel-head Shark. 

Probably the most abundant shark in Charleston Harbor. It is 
skinned and eaten by the negroes. 

5. Sphyrna zygaena (Liim.) Raf. 

No si)ecimens obtained. A large skin of this species is in the Charles- 
ton Museum. 

6. Odontaspis littoralis (Mitch.) J. & G. 

A stuffed skin is in the Charleston Museum. A large pair of jaws 
was also obtained from Mr. Leslie. 

7. Hypoprion brevirostris Poey. 

Body robust, its greatest height equaling the greatest breadth of the 
very depressed, flattened head; snout short, tlal, broadly rounded ante- 
riorly, the greatest height before mouth equaling distance from tip of 
snout to nostril; nostril midway between tip of snout aud posterior 
edge of pupil; distance from snout to front of eye tw^o-thirds the broad 
interorbital space; preoral portion of snout about one-half intei orbital 
width; flap of anterior nostril very short, ending in an acute angle; 
width of mouth equaling distance from tip of snout to posterior margin 
of orbit, and slightly less than twice distance from tip of lower jaw to 
line connecting angles of mouth; angle of mouth with a short, deep, 
fold, half diameter of orbit, extending on upper lip only. 

Teeth, ff ; those in upper jaw from a broadly triangular base, which 
is distinctly though minutely serrulate on outer side only; above the 
base the cusp is abruptly constricted, narrowly triangular, with entire 
edges, the point turned but little towards the side. Teeth in lower jaw 
much narrower and shorter than those in the upper, erect, with base 
and edges of cusp entire. 

Eye small, its diameter about one-flfth interorbital width. 



582 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Gill openings very wide; width of first slit nearly equaling its dis- 
tance from fourth gill slit. Branchial area about as deep as long. 

First dorsal inserted posteriorly, its origin nearly midway between 
anterior insertions of pectorals and ventrals ; the fin but little higher 
than long, the upper margin lunate, the greatest height one-half length 
of head from snout to third gill slit. Second dorsal similar to the first, 
the height but 'ittle less. Distance between dorsals twice the base of 
the first, 2^ times base of second. 

Anal smaller than second dorsal, the margin very deejily incised ; its 
origin slightly posterior to that of second dorsal, the two fins terminat- 
ing about on the same vertical. 

Caudal with a deep groove-like pit at base above, and a shallow, in- 
conspicuous one below. Length of upper caudal lobe rather more than 
length of head from snout to last gill slit. 

Pectorals short and very broad, their posterior margins crescentic; 
tips reaching nearly half way to middle of ventral base, scarcely to end 
of first third of dorsal base. Outer edge of ventrals one-third length 
of caudal, one-half that of ])ectoral. 

Color greenish olive, dusky above ; fins all, except first dorsal, with 
black margins, which are very wide on anal and caudal ; eyes very light 
grayish ; tongue and inside of mouth generally, brilliant white. 

A single specimen, about 2i feet long, was taken in Charleston Har- 
bor. It was not recognized by the fishermen as a common shark. 

The description given by Professor Poey is so short that we cannot 
consider the present identification of it as certain. 

8. Pristis pectinatus Latham — Sawfish. 

A large skin of this species and several " saws" are in the Charles- 
ton Museum, having been taken on the coast of South Carolina. 

9. Rhiuobatus lentiginosus Gariuan. 

Olive brown above, everywhere, except on dorsal and caudal fins, and 
on sides of snout covered with small, round, bluish- white spots, about 
one-third diameter of pupil; these spots extend on rostral cartilage 
two thirds distance to tip; lateral margins of snout, as well as rostral 
cartilage, dusky below; ventrals margined posteriorly with whitish, 
very distinctly white in the young; entire coloration distinct in young 
before birth. 

Body narrow, the greatest width of disk one-half distance from snout 
to origin of first dorsal ; snout very long and narrow, its length from 
front of eye equaling one-third its distance to vent; rostral ridges 
wholly united below for their entire length ; above, the ridges are very 
narrow, uniting to form a spatulate tip, thence separated by a very nar- 
row groove, which becomes wider on posterior fourth ; sides of snout 
semi-trausluceut. 

Eye equal to the concave interorbital space, which is contained -tf

times in snout. (Ireatest width of spiracle two-thirds eye; i)osterior 
nmruin of spiracle with two folds. Nostrils about one-sixth wider than 
the interspace ; anterior valve with a narrow wing-like niembrajie reach- 
ini;- onter angle, the valve not reaching inner angle by nearly one-third 
width of nostril. 

Mouth perfectly straight, the lower jaw with a very inconspicuous 
pi(»iecti<)n, fitting into a slight emargination of the upper; width of 
nioutli 2f times in distance to tij) of snout: teeth not pointed, in about 
To vertical series in each jaw. 

Distance from snout to end of pectoral 2jf in total length ; distance to 
vent, 2^ in total. 

Dorsals equal, the interval between them three-fourths length of 
snout (to eye) ; their base one-half their height, which equals length of 
snout and eye. Distance from first dorsal to root of ventrals, 1^- iu snout. 

Caudal broad and short, the two lobes of nearly equal width, the 
upper pointed; posterior margin of fin obliquely truncate, without 
norch ; upper lobe five-sixths length of snout. 

J^kiu very minutely granular : a group of six large tubercles at tip of 
snout ; a series of smaller tubercles on anterior rim of orbit, and a few 
on upper rim posteriorly ; a series of similar small tubercles, compressed, 
and with backward-directed spine, running from head along median line 
of back to dorsal ; those between dorsals obsolescent ; a single tubercle 
on each shoulder. 

Sides of tail with a very conspicuous wide fold, extending to lower 
lobe of caudal. 

A single specimen, a female, about 2 feet long, with five well-developed 
young, was obtained (July 2G) in Charleston Harbor. This species is 
Well k-nown to fishermen, but is said to be not abundant. 

10. Torpedo oocideutalis Storer. 

Traditions of the <?lectric fish l)eing taken at Charleston are current 
among the fishermen. No specimens were seen, and the fish is doubt- 
less rare. 

11. Pteioplatea inaclura, (Lc Siumu) M. & H. 

Abundant in the harbor, where numerous specimens were taken. 
None of these had any trace of the caudal spine, though the largest seen 
was 18 inches long. At what size, if at all, is the caudal spine devel-

12. Trygon sabina Le Sueur — Sting Rat/. 

Agreeing well with Garraau's account of the species (in J. & G., Syn. 
Fish. N. A. 68), but with the snout somewhat produced and acute. Teeth 
about If, those in sides of upper jaw enlarged. Width of mouth equal- 
ing that of interorbital space ; nasal flap broadly concave behind. Length 
of disk greater than its width, contained 1| times in length of tail. Cau- 
dal spine long, nearly equaling snout ; a short, rather high, cutaneous

fold, beginning immediately behind its tip, ami extending for a distance 
rather less than length of spine ; a much longer, rather higher fold on 
under side of tail, beginning slightly in advance of base of spine, and 
extending beyond end of upper fold. 

Top of head between eyes rather sparsely covered with small stellate 
prickles (these almost wanting in one specimen), which do not extend 
backward on body ; body naked with exception of the median dorsal, 
series of very strong backward-hooked prickles, each arising from a 
long naiTow base ; a single prickle on each shoulder (sometimes want- 
ing) ; upper surface of tail behind the fold with numerous minute back- 
ward-hooked prickles, arising from stellate bases; a few also on lower 
surface of tail towards tip. 

Very abundant in the harbor. 

13. Stoasodon narinaii (Eiiphraseu) Cantor — Clam-cracker. 
Not rare. A single large specimen seen. 

14. Manta birostris (Walb.) Jor. «fe G\\\,.—DevU-fish. 

Two stuffed skins in the Charleston Museum, The " devil-fish " is 
said to be abundant off Port Royal, S. C, each year, about the last of 
August. 

15. Lepidosteus osseiis. (Linn.) Agassiz. — Gar. 

Two specimens wore taken in the salt water of the harbor. 

16. Amiacalva Linn. 

A specimen in Charleston Museum from Black River, South Carolina. 

17. Arius felis (Linn.) J. & G. — Small-mouthed cat-Jinh. 

Exceedingly abundant in the harbor, but eaten only by the poorer 
classes. In this si)ecies the maxillary barbel frequently extends beyond 
base of pectoral spine, thus agreeing in all respects with "A. equestris^ 
Bd. & Grd. In July many males were captured with mouths full of 
their young. 

18. ^lurichthys marinus, (Mirch.) B. & G.— Large-mouthed cat-fish. 
Very abundant, although much less so than the preceding. 

19. Elops saurus Linn. — Jack Mariddle. 

Common in the harbor, but not eaten, the flesh said to be tasteless. 

20. Brevoortia tyrannus (Latrobe) Quodf^.— Menhaden. 

The young are very abundant in the harbor during the summer 
months. A study of the material in our possession, comprising speci- 
mens from Beaufort, N.C., Charleston, S. C, Saint John's River, Florida, 
Pensacola, Fla., Mobile, Ala., and Galveston, Tex., convinces us that the 
Gulf menhaden {B. patronus, Goode) should be considered a scarcely 
tangible variety of fi/rannn>i, rather th;jn a distinct species. We are- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. i')85 

unable to appreciate any coiistant differences in proportions of head 
and fins, or in tlie serration of tlie scales. The length of the head in our 
specimens is about one-third length of body, sometimes a litflr more, 
sometimes less, and without reference to locality. 

21. Dorosoma cepedianuin (Le SiuMir) Gill. — Gizzard-shad. 

Comparison with specimens from White River, Indiana, and from 
Charleston, where the species is abundant, fails to show any difference 
between them. Examines from Galveston, however, as has been al- 
ready noted (Proc. IT. S. Xat. Mus., 1882, 248), differ conspicnonsly in 
api)earauce from the ordinary type because of much slenderer body^ 
the depth being 2| in length (instead of 2i); in the Galveston form the 
caudal peduncle is notably longer and slenderer, and the head slen- 
derer. This Galvest<m form seems to us worthy of being distinguished 
as a subspecies, and may be called Borosoma cepedianiim siibsp. e.cUe. 

22. Stolephorus mitchilli (C. «& V.) J. & G. 
(Jor. & Gilb. Proc. U. S. Nat. Miis., 1S&2, 248.) 

Very common in Charleston Harbor, and agreeing perfectly with spec- 
imens from Wood's Holl, Galveston and Pensacola. Head, 3| : depth,. 
3f; D. 14; A. 27. 

23. Stolephorus browni (Ginel.) J. & G. 
Several specimens in Charleston Museum. 

24. Synodus fcetens (Liuu.) Gill. — Providence Whiting. 

Common in the harbor and on the Black-fish banks. Cautiously- 
handled by the fishermen because of its supposed poisonous proper- 
ties. 

25. Fundulus majalis (Walb.) GUntber. 

Several specimens in the Charleston Museum, collected on the South 
Carolina coast. 

26. Fundulus similis (Girard) Jordan. 

Many young specimens caught in tide-pools in the harbor. 

27. Fundulus heteroolitus (Linn.) Giinther.— Mwrf^fls/i. 

Many specimens from Charleston enable us to make a more detailed 
comparison with specimens from the Gulf, and to demonstrate the per-^ 
manence of the characters separating the two forms. Of these the east- 
coast form (typical heteroclitus) has all the fins conspicuously larger,- 
and the wiiite spots on vertical fins, in the male, smaller and more nu- 
merous. Other details of form and coloration are the same in both, and 
it will probably be better to consider the Gulf form as a subspecies. 

In adult male heteroclitus the longest dorsal ray is contained If times-

iu head (in grandis 2); longest anal ray 1^ (in grandis 14); caudal 3i in 
length (iu grandis 4); ventrals reaching front of anal, 2 iu head (iu gran- 
dis 2| iu head, barely reaching vent); base of dorsal 2 iu head (in gran- 
dis 2|). The youug of both sexes, one inch long, are conspicuously 
barred with darker; iu females the bars narrower than the interspaces, 
iu males much wider than the interspaces and less numerous.

A siugle specimen from Black Iliver, South Carolina, presented by Dr. 
G. E. Manigault, agrees in most respects with Giinther's description of 
H. chrysotus. It differs in having all the vertical fins dotted with brown, 
the dots not forming distinct cross bauds on the caudal, and in having 
the dorsal inserted rather uiore anteriorly (opposite the third anal ray 
instead of the tifth). The following is a detailed description of our 
si^ecimen : 

Body short and robust; the caudal peduncle high and compressed, its 
least height 1^ in head; head short, wide, and flat, the interorbital width 
one-half its length. Teeth iu jaws iu a narrow band, the outer series 
much enlarged, those iu the lower jaw larger and more numerous than 
those of the upper. Snout very short and blunt, the two jaws nearly 
equal iu closed mouth; length of snout nearly two-thirds diameter of 
orbit, which is contained 1^ times iu interorbital width, aud 3^ times iu 
head. 

Origin of dorsal midway between tip of caudal aud posterior rim of 
orbit; its distance from base of caudal one-half distance from front of 
■orbit; base of dorsal 2^ iu head, its height If iu head; its origin is 
opposite the nineteenth scale of lateral liue, and the third ray of the 
iinal fin. 

Base of anal fin rather less than half length of head, its greatest height 
somewhat more than half; dorsal and anal not nearly reaching caudal 
when depressed. Caudal mutilated, ai)parently broadly rounded. 

Pectorals reaching ventrals, If in head. Ventrals short, not nearly 
reaching vent, one-half head. 

Head, 3^ iu length; depth, 34; D. 9; A. 11; scales, 32-12. L. la 
inches. 

Color in spirits: Light olive-brown, top of head and a narrow median 
streak in front of dorsal flu darker; middle of sides, especially behind, 
with rather indistinct pearl-colored dots; middle of sides of trunk and 
tail with about 14, not clearly defined, narrow half- bars; an elongate 
dark area above base of pectorals. Vertical fins with small, black 
specks, less numerous on caudal tin; other fins i)lain.

.29. Gambusia patruelis holbrooki (Ajiassiz) J. & G. 

A specimen from Black River, Sontli Carolina, was i)resented by Dr. 
Manij^ault. 

Head 05 in length; ey(^ 2J in head, liMn interorbital width; I), 7; A. 
9; hit. 1. 30. The dark bar across (iheeks is distinct, and the vertical 
fins are marked with blackish dots, which form two very distinct cross- 
bands on candal tin. In G. j^af nidi s from Galveston, these bars ou tbe 
candal are either indistinct or altogether wanting, and the dark bar on 
cheeks is often obsolete; in all specimens of holbrooli swn h\ ns, these 
markings are conspicuons. 

Three yonng males (less than 1 inch long), from Entaw Springs, S. 
C, show dark spots on dorsal fin, and a dark shade across cheeks. The 
specimens agree in proportions and fin rays with adnlt females. 

30. Ophichthys clirysops Poey — ^^Sea-serpent." 

A single specimen, 20 inches long, evidently of the same species as onr 
mutilated specimen from Pensacola (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1882, 261), 
and answering- well Poey's descrijition of Ophichthys vhryso})s, shows the 
following characters : 

Olive-brown above, thickly dusted with dark points ; pectorals wholly 
dusky; dorsal and anal translucent, with blackish margins ; body white 
below ; mucous pores on head consi)i(;uous, black ; lower jaw with dusky 
cross-blotches ; no dark lines on throat. 

Head and trunk If in tail ; head 2^ in trunk ; eye equaling interorbi- 
tal space 1^ in snout, 9;V in head ; a series of about eight mucous pores 
along side of each mandible; numerous })ores on nape and top of head, 
three in a vertical series behind eye, about four along sides of upjjer 
jaw below eye; cleft of mouth 2| in head. Teeth conical, short and 
strong, not blunt, uniform in size, none of them enlarged; in two very 
distinct series on all the dentigerous bones. Anterior nostrils not 
elongate, the tube less than diameter of eye. Gill openings broadly 
crescent-shaped, separated by a distance 1^ their width, which is about 
one- third gape of mouth. 

Dorsal beginning over last fourth of pectoral, the distance of its origin 
from snout equaling two-fifths distance from snout to vent ; pectoral 
about equaling gai>e of mouth. Free portion of tail sharp, comi)ressed, 
about two-thirds diameter of orbit. 

The description of OpMmrus gomesii Castelnau is possibly based on a 
specimen of this species, and the specific name would, in that case, super- 
sede chrysops. Hut the description is inadequate and might refer to one 
of several other species. We think it best to retain Poey's name. 

31. Tylosurua marinus (Bl. & Scliu.) J. &. G. 

Numerous specimens seen swimming about in the harbor, where it is 
doubtless abundant. 



588 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

32. Hemirhamphus unifasciatus Ranzani. 

The single example obtained agrees m all respects with specimens of 
unifasciatus from Beaufort, N. 0., but has the anterior rays of dorsal 
and anal, and the upjjer and lower rays of caudal, jet black. In these 
respects it agrees with si)ecimens obtained at Mazatlan, Mexico. 

33. Exocoetus mesogaster Blocli. 

{Exoccetus hilUanus Gosse.) 
Evidently not rare in the open sea off Charleston Harbor. Two spec- 
imens were brought in by a fishing smack, having flown on board dur- 
ing the night. A third specimen was presented by Mr. Leslie. D. 11- 
12 ; A. 12-13. 

34. Siphostoma louisianae (Giinther) J. & G. — "Gar-fish." 

Abundant. Dorsal on 9 or 10 rings; snout exceedingly variable in 
length, sometimes half longer than rest of head, and longer than base 
of dorsal; often much shorter than this; occiput and belly more or less 
strongly carinate; rings 16+9+31 or 15+10+31. D. 33 to 35. An 
adult female has the dorsal whitish, with oblique dusky bands about as 
broad as the interspaces. 

35. Hippocampus stylifer Jor. & Gilb. — Sea-horse. 
(J. & G., Proc. U. S. National Museum 188-^,2f)5. ) 

A single specimen, nearly 2 inches long, was obtained. The character- 
istic coloration is well shown at this age, the light gray cross-bands 
with dark brown borders being very distinct. The body is very slender,^ 
its greatest depth about two-thirds length of head ; snout somewhat 
shorter than in the specimen from Pensacola, its length equaling post- 
orbital part of head. Dorsal inserted on four rings, a half only of the 
first and fourth rings being covered; dorsal rays, 16; plates of body,. 
12+35. 

Still another specimen of this species, collected in the Gulf of Mexica 
by Prof. O. P. Hay, has 18 rays in the dorsal, and the body plates 
12+34. 

36. Mugil albula Liun.— Mullet. 
Abundant. 

36(&) Mugil brasiliensis Ag. — Mullet. 

Rather more abundant than the preceding. 

37. Querimaua harengus (Gthr.) J. & G. (Gen. vor.) 

(Myxus harcitgits Gthr., iii, 467.) 

Several specimens, about two inches in length, were taken, agreeing 
entirely with others from Mazatlan, Panama, and Zorritas, Peru. The 
wide distribution of this little mullet is remarkable. It probably does 
not reach a greater length than 2 or 3 inches. It is not a true Myxus, 
as it has but two anal spines (instead of three), fixed teeth in the upper 



riiOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 589 

jaw only. We therefore consider it as the type of a distinct genus 
Querimana (from Queriman, a Portngnese or Spanish name of Mvgil 
liza, in Surinam). The stomach is gizzard-lilie as in MxgiL Eyelid 
not adipose. 

38. Menidia laciniata Swain. — Silrrr-Ji-sk. 

Four young specimens were obtained, in all of which the anal rays 
iire 1, 19, thus agreeing with s[)ecimens from Beaufort, N. C, and differ- 
ing from topical vagrmiH from Galveston, which has the anal rays usually 
1, 17 (1, 14 to 1, 17). These young specimens show the following colora- 
tion: Clear trauvslucent, greenish above; back with two or more rather 
regular series of minute black dots, usually not more than one on each 
vscale; snout and lower jaw dusky; lateral silvery streak rather wide, 
covering the third row of scales, not bounded above by a dark line, but 
the entire band dusted with dark points. A few minute dots on base of 
-anal ; caudal dusky. 

39. Menidia bosci (C.&.V.) Swiiiu.—Silver-fisli. 

(Menidia dentex Goode & Bean, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1882, 42i).) 

Two young specimens, one having the anal rays 22, the other 23, are 
•colored as follows: Greenish-yellow on back, very thickly covered with 
fine dots, as are also the snout and lower jaw; lateral streak very nar- 
row, bordered above with a conspicuous greenish-black line; the stripe 
about as wide as pupil, covering the middle of the fourth series of scales. 
Caudal conspicuously light yellow; dorsal and pectoral fins less so; 
base of anal dusky. 

40. Sphyreena picuda (Bloch) Foey. —Barruviida. 

Rare oif Charleston Harbor; said to be very infrequently seen. A 
single specimen, about 18 inches long, was taken on the bottom in 10 
fathoms of water. It shows the following characters: 

Color, dusky bluish above and on sides, silvery white below; about 20 
dusky bars, much wider than the interspaces, descend from back not 
quite to lateral line; lower part of sides with a few black blotches, irreg- 
ular in shape and position, usually little larger than pupil; top of head 
blackish; opercular menibrane above black; soft dorsal, anal, ventrals 
and caudal black; the dorsal and aual with tips of first and last rays 
white; pectorals and spinous dorsal fin dusky, the axil black; ventrals 
margined with white posteriorly. 

Head very large, the lowerjaw especially strong and heavy, the snout 
rather bluntly conical ; maxillary about half length of head, reaching 
front of pupil. Premaxillary series of teeth small, compressed, of uni- 
form size, about 40 in number; vomer with two pairs of very large, com- 
pressed teeth, triangular in shape, their length more than half diameter 
of pupil ; the an terior i)air directed downwards, the posterior down wani s 
and backwards, the two pairs separated by an interspace equal to their 
length; palatines with a close set series of about 8 teeth similar to those

on the vomer, but rather smaller; a large compressed tooth at symphy- 
sis; those of the lateral series of lower jaw small auteriorly, increasing 
constantly backwards, where they equal those of the palatine series. 
Eye large, 2.J in snout, 2 in postorbital part of head, nearly equaling 
interorbital area. Interorbital space concave, with a shallow median 
groove, divided by a ridge in front and behind ; supraocular ridge bony^ 
striate. 

Distance from snout to front of dorsal 1:^ in distance from latter to 
root of caudal; second dorsal spine longest, one- half length of snout 
and eye; space separating dorsals 5^ in length of body; second dorsal 
and anal opposite and equal, their margins concave, the longest ray about 
2f in head. Caudal broad, moderately forked ; the middle rays half 
the outer; the two lobes equal, concave. Pectoral reaching somewhat 
beyond front of dorsal, one-third head. Ventrals inserted slightly in 
advance of dorsal ; their distance from snout two-fifths length of body; 
their length of in head. Scales large, uniform in size; head naked, 
except cheeks and opercles, whicli are covered with small embedded 
scales. 

Head three in length; depth equaling snout, 2-|^ in head. D. V — 1, 9; 
A. II, 8. Scales 10-78-10 (the cross series counted from lateral line to 
front of dorsal, and anal fins respectively). About 12 series of scales 
on the cheeks. 

41. Polyuemus octofilis (Gill) J. & G. 

In appearance much resembling P. appt'oximam, the body compara- 
tively little elongated, with short head and small mouth ; snout heavy, 
projecting beyond mouth for a distance nearly equal to its own lengthy 
posterior margin of orbit midway between preopercular margin and 
anterior nostril; mouth small, the maxillary extending beyond orbit, 
for a distance equaling two-thirds diameter of orbit; maxiUary 2^ in 
head; snout three-fourths diameter of orbit; eye slightly less than inter- 
orbital space, 4J in head; i)reorbital two-fifths vertical diameter of orbit; 
longest-gill raker five-sixths diameter of eye; 18 on lower limb. 

Interval between dorsals If in head; third dorsal si)ine highest, 1^ 
in head, nearly reaching origin of second dorsal wlien depressed ; second 
dorsal falcate, its highest raj' If in head. 

Anal not falcate, the tips of anterior rays not i)rojecting beyond the 
gently concave outline of the fin; longest ray If in head; insertion of 
anal opposite second soft ray of dorsal ; anal spines comparatively well 
developed, the third equaling diameter of orbit. 

Lower caudal lobe 3^ in body. 

Ventrals inserted under fifth dorsal spine, their length nearly ^ head. 

Pectorals reaching vertical from tips of ventrals 1^ in head. Fila- 
ments slender; 8 in luimber; the length of the upper one one-third dis- 
tance from tip of snout to fork of caudal tin, reaching slightly beyond 
the vent; the lowermost filament two-thirds head.

Head Sf in length ; depth 3^ ; D. VIII— 1, 12 ; A. Ill, 13. Lateral line 
forkiug at base of caudal; thence continued to margin of fin ; 02 tnbeR 
from shoulder to fork ; 5^ series above lat. 1., 10 below. 

Color verj- light olivaceous, tinged with light yellow ; scales on back, 
with wide dusky margins formed by dark pnnctulations ; belly white ; 
tip of snout with numerous coarse black points ; a few of these on max- 
illary also ; vertical fins yellowish and dusky, with black points ; tip of 
anterior anal rays white ; ventrals whitish ; the outer rays dusky ; pec- 
torals almost uniform deep black, the color formed by closely approxi- 
mated coarse black points ; filaments translucent, slightly dusky. 

It is probable that all species of Polynemus have three anal spines 
and not two, although this latter number has been assigned to various 
species by different authors. The first spine is very short, and usually 
largely enveloi^ed in the scales. Our specimen differs from young spec- 
imens of P. octonemus Grd. (no adults being known) from the Gulf of 
Mexico in its shorter pectoral filaments, shorter ventral fins, and in the 
pectoral fins being black. 

One specimen only was obtained at Charleston, where it is evidently 
very rare. It was wholly unknown to the fishermen. 

42. EcheneiB uaucrates Linn. — Pilot-fish. 

Of frequent occurrence. The specimen obtained has 22 laminae, the 
length of disk being 4f in total, and the greatest width between pec- 
torals one-half length of disk. A specimen from Pensacola has 22 
laminae in the disk, which is contained 4| times in total, and a third 
specimen, from Saint John's Ri^ er, has the disk also with 22 laminae, 
but the length only 4J in total. 

43. Remora squalipeta (Dalcl.) J. & G. 

According to Liitken (Contributions Ichthyographiques V, 5) Echeneis 
squalipeta Daldorf is based on the young of Echeneis remora Liuue. In 
case, then, it is considered desirable to give generic rank to Remora^ 
Daldorf's name will be the oldest available for the species. 

iSTumerous specimens from the vicinity of Charleston are in the Charles- 
ton Museum. 

44. PMhirichthys lineatus (Menzics) Gill. 

Body with the general form and api)earance of Echeneis naucrates, the 
head much more narrowed anteriorly, the tip of lower jaw thus form, 
ing a very narrow, linguiform projection, out of line with the rounded 
profile of sides of head. Mouth with Made gape, the maxillary about 
f head (from tip of snout). Teeth comparatively large and few in 
number, somewhat recurved, not forming a close-set band; those 
laterally in upper jaw in about 2 distinct series, forming a narrow patch 
in front; no external series of compressed, close-set teeth as is found in 
Kemora, and no distinct canines, though the outer series are larger than 
the inner; teeth in lower jaw similar to those in the upper, arranged in 
about three series laterally, and forming a narrow wide-set patch in 



592 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

front ; teeth ou vomer, palatines, and tongue similar to those in jaws, 
but much smaller; vomerine patch broad, concave, with two lateral 
backward processes; on each side of this is the short, narrow palatine 
baud (wholly lacking in specimens examined of Remora squalipeta,, and 
Echeneis naucrates) of about 3 irregular series. Eye 3| in head, half 
width of interorbital space. Disk wide, covering all of top of head, its 
Avidth 1§ in its length, which is one-fifth total length with caudal ; la- 
mellae but 10 in number, very strongly pectinate. 

Origin of dorsal midway between base of caudal and third cephalic 
plate ; the shape of dorsal, anal, and caudal as in Echeneis naucrates^ the 
median caudal rays being, in our young specimen, produced. Pectoral 
pointed, the rays all normal, about 18 in number; its tip not quite reach- 
ing tip of ventral, which is 4 head. 

D. X-30; A. 30. Head 5^ in length ; depth about ^ length of head. 
Length 4 inches. 

Color, slaty -black, a darker band along middle of sides, bounded above 
and below with a narrow white streak, the upper beginning on snout, 
the lower below eye, the two slightly con verging backwards ; under side of 
head lighter; auterior lobes of dorsal and anal, upper and lower caudal 
rays, and pectoral fins, broadly margined with white; ventrals and pos- 
terior dorsal and anal rays with narrow white margins. 

The genus P/i^/imt7ii%s is evidently most nearly related to Echeneis, 
from which it may be separated, as well by the peculiar dentition as by 
the reduced number of plates on the head. 

A single small specimen, 4 inches in length, was taken at Charleston. 
This agrees well with descriptions given by Foey,of Echeneisapicalis and 
Echeneis siyhyrcenarum, but lias not the conspicuously enlarged teeth in 
sides of lower jaw, assigned to the latter. 

45. Elacate Canada (Liuu.) Holbrook.—CoWa. 

Not infrequently taken in the summer mouths. A single specimen 
was obtained. 

46. Trichiunis lepturus Liiiu.— "St(or(?-^8/t"; Silver-eel. 

Very abundant in Charleston Harbor, being brought in by every seine- 
boat. 

47. Scomber colias (iinelin. 

A single specimen of this species, captured at Charleston in the fall 
of 1880, was presented by Mr. Chas. C. Leslie. 

The three species of Scombei', known to occur on our coasts, may be 
thus distinguished.

greater than iuterorbital space, 4f in head. Maxillary 2f in head, the 
distance from tip of snout to angle of mouth, 2f in head; posterior

Top of lieacl with a conspicuous transparent area, whitish in spirits j 
eye very large, wider than interorbital area, 4 in head. Maxillary 2f 
in head ; the distance from tip of snout to angle of mouth 2^ in head ; 
posterior margin of preopercle straight, and rather less oblique than in 
pneumatophorus ; the lower margin longer and less rounded than in 
scomhrm; subopercle very long and narrow ; its greatest width rather 
less than one-half diameter of orbit ; opercle with a deep emarginatiou 
opposite base of pectorals. Head 3* in length (without caudal). 

Dorsal fin normally with 9 spines, a 10th sometimes present. 

Scales still larger than in pneumatopliorus ; those on sides in about 
175 oblique series ; lateral line very conspicuous ; corselet conspicuous, 
composed of large scales. 

Our specimen from Charleston, S. C, one from Pensacola, Fla., and 
several from Venice and Genoa, Italy, agree in all respects. 

The Scomher colias of Gmeliu was founded on the fish called by Cetti 
Lacerto or Colias, and it can probably never be known with certainty 
which of the three species found in the Mediterranean was thus desig- 
nated. There can, however, be no doubt as to the species called colias 
by Eisso. The name may therefore be retained for the present species. 
Inasmuch as no other name had been given prior to this definition. 

Steindachner considers 8. pneumatophorus as the young of 8. colias. 
We have specimens young and old of both. We are not yet fully con- 
vinced, however, that the two forms are really distinct species. 

48. Scomberomorus maculatus (Mitch.) J. & G. — Spanish mackerel. 
Numerous specimens were observed in the market. 

49. Scomberomorus (?) caballa (C. & V.) J. & G.—King-flsh. 

A large species of Scomberomorus^ known as King-fish, and having 
inconspicuous dusky spots on sides, is, during the summer months, very 
abundant off shore, from Cape Hatteras southward. Coasting steamers 
catch them with trolling lines on every trip, the fish averaging from 3 
to 5 feet long. A single specimen was seen, about 3i feet long, cap- 
tured off Cape Lookout, but no description taken sufiQcieut for the posi- 
tive identification of the species. The fishermen at Charleston are 
well acquainted with the King fish, though they seldom capture it.

Scomher cnjsos Mitchill, Trans. Lit. & Philos. Soc. N. Y. I, 424, 1815.

There can be little doubt that the species described by Mitchill as 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 595 

^^ Scomber cri/sos,^^ the "yellow mackerel," is the Garanx pisquet)is C 
& v., and not the Gar mix hqypos Linn. The only reason that c;:ii be 
nrgecl for the identification of '■'■ crysos-' with hippos^ is the depth as- 
signed to the former (oj in total length), this being- greater than that 
nsually fonnd in insquetus (3^ to 4 in total). It is to be noted, however, 
that Mitchill's specimen was only 6.^ inches long, and the young or" all 
the species of Garanx have the depth appreciably greater than do the 
adults. Furthermore, Mitchill's measurements, taken as they were in 
inches, would easily permit the slight inaccuracy necessary to account 
for this difference in depth. The figure given by Mitchill, if sufficiently 
accurate to be of value, would seem to be based on a young specimen 
of hippos. It differs, 'however, too widely from the accompanying de- 
Hcription to allow us to consider it identical with the specimen used by 
Mitchill for the type of the species. 

The following characters, given by Mitchill, leave little doubt as to 
the species he had in mind ; " a neat, compact, handsome fish, about '^ 
inch thick. He is plump, generally. Back forms a neat regular curve. 
Belly an opposite corresponding sweep. Head neither rostrated nor 
blunt." "A black spot frequently at the edge of the gill cover." " D. 
8, 24, A. 20." These characteristics are exactly those of pisquetus, while 
hippos, on the contrary, is a high compressed fish, not at all plump, 
with the back forming a high vmeven curve, and the belly not at all 
arched, but running in a straight oblique line from chin to front of anal: 
the head is also blunt, the rostral profile being sub-vertical, and the fin 
formula is 2d D. 21-22 : A. 16-17. In addition we have the fact, of lit- 
tle importance, perhaps, that the pisquetus is by far the commoner form 
northward, and is generally known as the "Yellow Mackerel." 

Garanx chri/sus is the only species of Garanx brought in much abun- 
dance to the market of Charleston, during the summer months. The 
name Jaclc-Grevalle is there applied to all species of Caranx without dis- 
tinction-. 

51. Caranx hippos (Liun.) J. & G, 
But few specimens seen. 

52. Caranx setipinnis (Mitch.) J. & G. 

Many specimens taken in the harbor are in the Charleston Museum. 
A single immature example was seen in the market. As has been noticed 
by Bleeker and Steindachner, this species has the armed lateral line of 
Garanx, from which genus we do not see how it can be separated. 

53. Selene vomer (Linn.) Liitken. — Hog-fish. 

The young form of this species, with filamentous dorsal and elongate 
ventrals, was very abundant in the harbor, ^o adults were seen. 

54. Chloroscombrus chrysurus (Linn.) Gill.— Bumper. 
Very abundant. 



r)96 rROCEE])INGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

55. Trachynotus caroliiius (Liun.) Gill. — CrevuUc. 

The most highly prized of the fishes of Chariostou. Not brought into 
the market iu great numbers; known universally as Crcvalle, the name 
Fompano being seldom used. 

56. Seriola caroliueusis Holbrook. — fack-fish; Amber-jack.

Two young specimens, each about 1 foot long, were obtained in the 
market, and many very young (3 or 4 inches long) were seen swimming 
on the surface, on the fishing grounds outside the harbor. These latter 
had the lateral bands intensely black and very conspicuous. The fol- 
lowing is the color shown by the two larger specimens, when fresh : 

Back duskj^ bluish, becoming dull white on sides and dull silvery 
below; five rather faint, broad, dark, half-bars downward from back 
to axis of body, about as wide as the interspaces ; a light yellow streak 
from eye back along axis of body to tail, most distinct where it crosses 
the vertical bars; an irregular yellowish area on lower half of sides 
anteriorly ; an oblique dusky baud from front of dorsal to eye, and one 
from eye forward to suborbital ; a broad dusky streak above base of anal ; 
soft dorsal and anal blackish olive, margined with white, the margin 
broad anteriorly ; spinous dorsal blackish ; caudal dusky olive ; ventrals 
silvery white, within dusky yellowish-green ; pectorals with olive tinge; 
a horizontal blackish streak on opercle. 

This species is exceedingly close to 8. zonata Mitch., the number of 
fin rays, the pattern of coloration, and the general proportions of head 
and body being the same. The northern form, zonata.^ has, however, 
the bauds on the sides appearing jet black at all ages, while in caro- 
Unensis of the same size these are merely darker shades. Zonata has 
also the depth much greater, and the body more compressed ; in speci- 
mens 1 foot long, the depth is contained 2^ times in length (to base 
of caudal), while in caroUnensis of the same size the depth is of in 
length. 

A detailed comparison of caroUnensis from Charleston with a speci- 
}iien of steariisi from Pensacola fails to show any differences. In young- 
specimens the occiput is more or less sharply keeled, as in zonata, this 
disappearing with age, the occiput becoming very broadly and obtusely 
rounded. 

57. Stromateus paru Linn. 

Very common during the summer months. 

Above, light bluish ; below, silvery ; everywhere with iridescent and 
brilliant silvery reflections; sides often with chocolate-brown blotches ; 
head light olive, translucent, without silvery reflections above ; snout 
and sides of head with much coarse, black speckling; anal yellowish- 
silvery, more oa- less dusky on the falcate rays, everywhere with irides- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 51)7 

cent reflections ; the fulcate rays margined anteriorly and above with 
black, the posterior rays densely pnnctulate with black, especially to- 
wards tips. Dorsal rays pinkish or pnrplish, with bright reflections, 
margined with blackish ; the posterior rays thickly dusted with dark 
points; pectorals and candal with slight yellowish tinge, and much 
black specking towards tip, the caudal margined very narrowly above 
and below with white. Iris silvery. 

Head, 3 to 34- in length ; depth, 1^ to 1^ ; pectoral, 2,^ to 2.^ ; eye, 2% 
to 3 in head; D. Ill— I, 44 to 47 ; A. Ill, 43 to 45. 

There is nothing to indicate that the West Indian form {Rhombus 
xanthurus C. & V., IX, 405) constitutes a species distinct from the 
above, unless it be the small number of flu rays attributed to the latter 
(D. IV, 40; A. Ill, 39). This is probably due either to a miscount or to 
the great variability of the species in this respect. Cuvier and Valen- 
ciennes identify with '■'■xanthurus''^ the figure of Sloane, on which Lin- 
naeus founded his Stromateus paru. The latter name must then sup- 
plant ^^alepidotm," and "■ gardeni,^'' unless it be shown that the form from 
the West Indies is really distinct.

Two female specimens of the common dolphin of our Atlantic coast, 
each about two feet long, were caught with trolling lines off Cape Look- 
out, during a trip from Baltimore to Savannah. Later in the summer 
a larger, mutilated, specimen was examined, captured by a flshing- 
smack in the vicinity of Charleston. Still later, two young specimens 
were sent by Mr. Stearns, from Pensacola. This material has enabled us 
us to make a careful review of the history of our Dolphins, which has 
convinced us that all names hitherto applied to Dolphins from ISTorth 
America are synonyms of one species, the Gori/pJtcvna hippurus Linnaeus, 
It is not improbable that the Coryphcena immaculata of Foey ii^ the C. 
equisetis Linn., as it has the fin rays, the inconspicuous spots, and the 
short pectorals of that species, but the name equisetis should not be in- 
troduced into our faunal lists until a bona fide example of the species is 
taken on our coast. From our own experience in counting the fin rays 
of the dolphin, it seems evident that a synonym cannot be referred either 
to hippurus or to equisetis on tlie basis of the count alone, even though, 



598 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

as I.utkeu coucludes, there probably are but two species, distinguished 
by diifereut fin-formulse. If the fins have become hardened or dried by 
exposure or by being immersed in too strong alcohol, it is impossible to 
obtain the correct count except by dissection. 

G. hippurus is very abundant off our South Atlantic coast in summer, 
being caught south of Cape Hatteras by coast steamers on nearly every 
trip. Korth of the cape it is said to be rarely taken . Tlie species reaches 
a length of 4 or 5 feet. 

When first caught, the head, body, and tail, are greenish olive, or dark 
greenish olive-brown, lighter below; a series of about 15 round blue 
spots on back along each side of base of dorsal, these placed at nearly 
uniform distances apart, and about one-third size of pupil ; sides below 
with numerous blue spots irregular in size, shape, and position, but none 
of them so large as those along back; lower lip largely blue ; about three 
concentric blue lines around snout above. Dorsal jmrplish blue, with 
irregular areas of lighter and darker, and with some greenish reflections; 
in one sp''cimen the dorsal and caudal are sparsely covered with blue 
spots similar to those on body. Caudal yellow ; anal yellowish, with 
translucent border; pectorals translucent, with brownish axil ; ventrals 
outwardly greenish olive, within of an indeterminate dark brownish, 
with olive cast. The play of color in the dying dolphin has been largely 
exaggerated, judging from our own observation. Such change as there 
is, seems to consist in the apparent rapid development of an external 
bright silvery pigment, with some blue and green reflections, this de- 
velopment being accompanied with partial restorations of the ground 
color, thus afibrdiug some real play of shades, which are, however, not 
l^rilliant. At death the fish is largely silvery, the intense deep lustrous 
blue of the spots remaining meanwhile unchanged ; afterwards appear 
large irregular patches of the ground color, yellowish on sides, yellow- 
ish olive-brown on back. 

D. 59 to G3 ; A. 20. 

Head little elevated, its lieight at origin of dorsal 1^ to I4 in its

Olivaceous very profusely tessellated with brownish on the sides; 
middle of sides with a series of about 10 blotches alternating with an 
equal number of square blotches on the back. A brown band below 
and one before eye. Vertical fins more or less barred with brown. 

We can find nothing in the description of hutlerianus to indicate that 
it is a distinct species from barratti. 

66. Roccus saxatilis (Blocli & Schn.) J. & G. 

This is the favorite game fish of the coastwise streams and inland 
lakes, but, according to fishermen, does not visit the salt water. Is it 
not i)0ssible that this difference iu the habit of the fish in the North and 
in the South may have developed varietal or specific differences'? No 
specimens were obtained at Charleston, so we are unable to make the 
comparison. The name lineatm ought not to be retained for this species, 
as Scicena lineata Bloch, Avas apparently the European species.

{= Diahasis lAumieri Lac.) was wrongly identified by Linnaeus with his 
formosa^ apparently on the ground that it also had the head striped. 

68. Serranus atraiius (Linn.) J. &G. — Black-fish. 

The most abundant food-fish at Charleston, forming probably more 
than nine-tenths of all the fish caught on the banks by the smack-men. 
It is not considered a choice fish, and is bought mostly by the poorer 
people. It is cai^ht on the bottom with hook and line, and is found 
abundantly at all seasons, though in much greater numbers in winter. 

69. Serranus philadelphicus (Linn.) J. & G.— Rock-fish. 

Ferca philadcJphica Liun., Syst. Nat., Ed. x & xii. 
Perca Irifurca Linn., Sj'st. Nat. Ed. xii. 

Not rare in Charleston Harbor, though never abundantly taken. Five 
specimens were obtained during the summer. The fish is usually caught 
with hand-lines among the rocks. Better specimens than those noted 
by us (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1882, 273) must be examined from the 
Gulf of Mexico before the range of this species can be confidently ex- 
tended to those waters, as the Gulf specimens are peculiar in several 
respects. Specimens from Charleston show the following traits: 

Color in life, olivaceous above, whitish below ; seven broad brown bars 
from back obliquely forwards to level of middleof pectorals, these almost 
obsolete along lateral line; the color of the bars is not intense, and is 
formed by shadings along the base and margins of the scales ; the an- 
terior bar crosses the nape, and is very indistinct. Snout and upper 
part of head with numerous brownish red spots and lines, three or four 
of these parallel and running from eye to snout, the interspace usually 
light blue ; upper lip reddish brown ; tip of lower jaw broadly purplish ; 
a dark blotch on opercle anteriorly, and sometimes a small dark spot 
behind eye ; lining of opercle and throat lemon yellow ; a large jet black 
blotch behind pseudobranchia?. Spinous dorsal translucent, with in- 
distinct whitish and dusky longitudinal streaks ; a large blackish blotch 
on membrane of last spines, immediately above fourth vertical bar of 
sides ; some dark spots on the spines form two irregular lengthwise 
series ; dorsal filaments bi-ight scarlet ; the fin usually with light bluish 
shading. Soft dorsal, with a series of bluish white spots near margin 
(one between each two rays); one or more incomplete series above and 
below this; the fin is margined with reddish brown, and has usually sev- 
eral series of reddish-brown spots, these most numerous posteriorly ; some 
irregular olive-brown spots towards base ; a small black spot on base 
of moml^rano between Stli and 9th and (me between 10th and 11th rays,

tlie former frequently absent. Caudal translucent, watli irregular cross- 
series of round brownish-red spots, the sjiace between them often with 
bluish- white spots ; the fin margined above with brownish red; lower 
lobe whitish, unspotted. Anal white, with a median sulphur-yellow 
streak, and a terminal dark bar ; ventrals whitish, with dusky areas^ 
often uniform blackish; pectorals translucent; peritoneum silvery. 

Head 2| to 2f in length ; depth 3^ to 3|. D. X, 11 ; A. Ill, 7 : P. 17 ; 
C. 18. Scales 5-55-15. Length 9^^ inches. 

Maxillary reaching posterior margin of pupil, 2;^ in head ; maiulibular 
band of teeth becoming a single series laterally ; a few inner teeth in 
the front of each jaw enlarged ; lower jaw with the inner series later- 
ally, and the outer series anteriorly of enlarged conical teeth, the lateral 
teeth but little larger than those in front; outer series of upper jaw much 
enlarged, becoming smaller laterally, those in front larger than any in 
lower jaw ; ijatch on vomer crescent-shaped; on palatines long and nar- 
row. Head naked forwards from occiput, including suborbital ringv 
snout, preorbital, top of head, maxillary and lower jaw ; scales on cheeks 
small, in 9 to 11 very regular oblique series ; scales on opercles as large 
as those on body, in 8 or 9 oblique series, those on the Hap again 
smaller ; least interorbital width about four-sevenths diameter of eye^ 
which is 4f in head; serrie on and below preopercular angle slightly 
enlarged and more distant than those above ; subopercle and interoper- 
cle finely, evenly serrate. Gill-rakers one-half eye, three above angle, 
ten below. 

First two dorsal spines short, the third and fourth nearly equal, the 
fourth one-half or nearly one-half head ; the last spines are then much 
shortened, forming a notch much as in species of " Paralabraxf the last 
spine 3| in head, two-thirds the ray following; membrane deeply in- 
cised between the spines, the upper angles produced beyond the spines 
in long, narrow filaments, very variable in length, usually less than 
diameter of orbit ; the spines themselves are acute, and not at all fila- 
mentous as figured by Holbrook (Ichth. S. C. pi. Vll, fig. 1) ; the struct- 
ure of the dorsal thus does not differ from that of *S\ atrarius, which has 
also a trifurcate tail ; this latter character does not however seem suflS- 
cient to warrant the retention of the genus Centropristis. 

Caudal with the upper and middle rays much produced and nearly 
equal, the lower lobe but little lengthened ; median rays nearly as long- 
as head (seven-eighths to eleven-twelfths), the lower rays about two- 
thirds head. A young specimen, 5 inches long, has caudal nearly evenly 
convex behind, with the upper rays only slightly projecting. 

Anal spines short, graduated, the second the strongest, the third 
slightly longer, about one-fourth head; longest rays nearly one-half 
head. 

Middle ventral rays longest, not nearly reaching vent, four-sevenths 
head ; pectoral sub-truncate, reaching vent, If in head. 

Scales very strongly ctenoid, running well up on caudal fin, and in

narrow series on membranes of soft portions of vertical fins ; veutrals 
with series nearly half-way to tip. 

The description of Perea philadelphica given in the 10th edition of 
LinnaBus could not have been identified with this species had not Lin- 
naeus himself, in his 12th edition, revised his description, correcting his 
count of fin rays, and adding numerous details. The first description 
stands : " Dorsal fins connate, with 11 sinnes and 9 soft rays. D. XI-9; 
P. 16 ; V. C ; A. Ill, 5; C. 11. Habitat in ximerica." In the 12th edi- 
tion the number of dorsal and anal rays is changed to: "D. X-llj 
A. Ill, 7," while the otber counts are left uncorrected. The coloration 
given is characteristic and leaves no doubt as to the species described : 
"A black spot on middle of dorsal fin ; sides with black spots and 
bands; red below; scales and opercles ciliate; opercle mucronate 
posteriorly ; first two dorsal rays (spines) shorter. Habitat in North 
America. Chuh. Dr. Garden."

The Perca chrysoptera of Linnaeus is not identifiable with this species, 
probably not with any other. The description is based on a specimen 
which was received from Charleston through Dr. Garden, and which 
was identified by Linnaeus with Catesby's figure of Perca marina gibbosa, 
this latter evidently- some species of Diabasis. But as not a sentence 
in the description of chrysoptera agrees with Catesby's figure, we cannot 
admit the identification to have been correct, and denying this, there 
is nothing in the description of clirysoptera to indicate that it is any 
Diabasis, much less the species at hand. 

Brownish-olive above, lighter on sides and below ; scales of back with 
central portions olivaceous, the bases and margins brownish olive; 
bright specimens show narrow yellow streaks on margins of scales on 
back, following the series upwards and backwards, these, however, sel- 
dom visible ; several longitudinal yellow streaks on sides; one midway 
between dorsal outline and lateral line, beginning on snout and running 
to last rays of soft dorsal; one on head just above eye, usually not con- 
tinued on body; a third very distinct streak along median line of body, 
beginning on snout and running through eye to tail ; several fainter 
streaks above and below the median one, following the series of scales, 
in bright specimens a streak on each series below median line ; snout 
very dark brown ; sides of head more or less silvery, with yellowish

tinge ; in bright specimens showing ses^en or eight yellow stripes, two of 
which are forward continuations of the two principal body stripes, the 
others smaller and not joining body stripes ; head white below ; a dusky 
bar at base of pectoral ; mouth, within, bright brick-red, becoming yel- 
lowish red on lining of ojjercles ; fins all plain dusky olive, somewhat 
darker towards tips ; the lower fins more distinctly yellowish ; a diffuse 
black blotch at base of caudal. The color is very variable, differing 
much with the surroundings and condition of the fish. Specimens are 
frequently seen of a plain silvery cast, the yellowish lines indistinct or 
wholly wanting, and the caudal blotch obsolete. It is without doubt 
from such a specimen that Hoi brook drew his description of '■'•Rcemulon 
chrysopterus,''' while his ^^Rwrnidon quadriUneatum^^ is quite evidently a 
somewhat careless description of a brightly-colored specimen of the 
same. The stripes vanish in spirits. 

Head 2-J in length ; depth 2^ to 3,1. D. XIII, 15; A. Ill, 9. Scales 
tV; '^5 pores or oblique series ; 70 vertical series. 

Body moderately elongate ; snout 2f in head ; maxillary reaching 
below middle of eye, If in bead : teeth in a villiform patch anteriorly, 
with an (tuter enlarged series, which is continued singly on sides of jaws. 
Eye much more than half length of snout, less than greatest width of 
preorbital, 4~^- in head. Gill-rakers short and weak, W in number. 

Scales above lateral line in oblique, below in horizontal series. None 
of the scales conspicuously enlarged ; those on middle of sides ante- 
riorly somewhat wider and less closely imbricated. Head scaled for- 
wards to front of eyes, the snout above and the upper jaws largely 
naked; some imbedded scales on preorbital and mandible. Soft parts 
of vertical fins wholly enveloped in fine, thin scales. Spinous dorsal 
high, the fourth spine highest, 2 to 2J- in head ; the outline of the fin 
rather evenly rounded ; last spine the shortest, about four-fifths longest 
soft ray, and two-fifths longest spine. 

Upper lobe of caudal subfalcate, longer tban the lower. If in head ; 
the middle rays, -/r t\\id upper. 

Second and third anal spines not very unequal in length, but the sec- 
ond evidently longer and much stronger, about equal to length of long- 
est soft ray, and ^J head. 

Ventrals reaching to or slightly beyond vent, If in head; pectorals 
equaling distance from snout to preopercular margin. 

This species is very abundant on the fishing banks outside the har- 
bor, where it is taken in much greater quantity than any other species 
excejit the Blacl-Jish.

much uarrower, and the color of body and fins is much darker; tlie 
preopercnlar denticuhitions are stronger, the snout longer and the eye 
smaller. It is possible that the soutliern form may represent a tangible 
variety, but our material is not sufficient to enable us to characterize it. 
The Charleston specimens showed in life the following coloration ; 
The basal half of eacli scale dark brown, the terminal half silvery, with 
bluish tinge; snout and lower jaw dark chocolate-brown, the end of the 
snout and the tip of lower jaw white; sides of head with brassy luster, 
and marked with about 18 very narrow, often wavy, blue lines, the 
widest on the snout being less than half width of interorbital space ; 
a few of these lines are extended on the body for a very short dist- 
ance (less than diameter of eye) ; two or three stripes run concentrically 
around snout above, joining anterior margins of orbits ; mouth very bright 
scarlet. A dark brown bar across base of pectoral, continued half way 
down on axil; fins brownish olive ; ventrals and anal blackish, the ven- 
trals margined externally with white. Scales below pectorals with 
numerous very short and narrow, horizontal, black lines ; scales on 
lower part of sides, and above lateral line, with dendritical clusters of 
dark lines diverging from the base. No blue streaks on low^r part of 
sides. 

73. Lobotes surinamensis (Bloch) Cnv.— Black Perch; AV« Perch. 

Occasionally taken ; a single specimen seen during the summer. 

74. Calamus bajonado (Bloch iS: Schneider) Poey. White-hone Porgy, 

A well-known food-fish at Charleston, averaging much larger than 
the common Porgy, specimens 18 inches long being of not infrequent 
occurrence. 

Our specimens fail in many respects to answer the incomplete de- 
scription given by Poey (Monogr. des Sparini, 176), notably in the num- 
ber of canines in each jaw (8 instead of 0) ; but this is in all probability 
the species described by him. 

Head 3^ in length ; depth '2\ ; pectoral .3 ; snout two-thirds head ; 
eye two-ninths ; maxillary three-sevenths, and ventral five-eighths head. 
D. XII, 12 ; A. Ill, 10. Pores in lateral line 44. 

The young (5 inches long) is olivaceous, with white longitudinal lines 
above and on sides, formed by series of spots, one on each scale ; sides 
of body with many irregular narrow dusky blotches, with a tendency 
to form bars on lower half of sides ; belly whitish ; vertical fins and 
ventrals with irregular wavy bars of dusky and whitish ; pectorals with 
a dusky bar at base. Adults have all the markings less evident, with 
usually no trace of vertical bars on sides; the dusky and whitish bands 
on fins persisting. 

75. Steuotomus chrysops (Linn.) Bean.— /'orj/y. 

An abundant food-fish, usually not reaching a length of more than S 
inches. The second ray of the dorsal is frequently filamentous. The 



I'ROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 605 

young show a broad, dusky, vertical bar on middle of sides. Both the 
<ir(iyrops and chry.sojt.s of Liuuieus are based on this species as is also 
Chrysophrys aculeafus C. & V. 

76. Lagodou rhoniboides (Linn.) Hoi brook. — Brha. 

Eather less abundant in Charleston Harbor tlian at other points along 
our Atlantic and Gulf coasts. 

77. Diplodus probatocephahxs (Walb.) J. & G.—Sheepshead. 
A tine food-tish, not taken in great abundance. 

78. Diplodus holbrooki (Beau) J. & G. — Salt-water Brim. 

Taken abundantly with hook-andline on the banks outside the har- 
bor. None were seen in the harbor, although this species is very abun- 
dant around the wharves at Beaufort, N. C. On the banks it reaches 
a length of 12 inches. 

Color in life : Body dark brassy-olive ; the large black blotch across 
caudal i)eduncle often not intensely black ; naked part of head dark 
olive-brown ; opercular membrane black ; a black blotch above and 
below at base of pectoral, that above continued around on upper half 
of axil of fin ; margins of all membrane-bones of head black, this often 
conspicuous on membrane of opercle only; ventrals black, the rays with 
greenish tinge; other fins uniform olive-brown. 

Although by no means satisfied that this species is distinct from I). 
caudimacula (Poey), we think it preferable to retain the name given to 
specimens froju our own waters until comparison can be made with a 
sufficient series from the West Indies.

so. Sciaena lanceolata (Holbrook) J. «fe G. 

Rather uncommon ; taken occasionally with hook-and-liue on the 
margins of deeper channels in the harbor. 

Color: grayish-olive above, silvery below ; tins all nearly uniform, 
dusky ; the ventrals margined with white ; much coarse, black speck- 
ing along middle of sides, base of anal fin, and inner lining of opercle. 

Head = depth, 3 to 3^ in length. D. XI, I. 22-23 ; A, II, 7-8. Scales,

Mouth large, maxillary reaching beyond middle of eye, sometimes to 
posterior margin of orbit, 2^1 J in head ; teeth in lower jaw uniform, 
in a very narrow band ; the upper jaw with the outer series enlarged ; 
«ye medium, its long diameter oblique. If in interorbital width, 4 to 4| 
in head. 

Preopercle evenly rounded, the serrations gradually increased in size 
towards the angle, which rarely shows three radiating spines larger 
than the others, the lowermost spine turned downward and backward. 
Pseudobranchise well developed. Gill-rakers rather long and slender, 
about 18 on lower limb.

87. Larimus fasciatus Holbrook. — Bull-head. 

Not uncommon in the harbor; numerous specimens procured, the 
largest about 8 inches long. 

In life the color is grayish-olive above, with some silvery; below, 
clear silvery- white; back with 7 to 9 rather inconspicuous darker bars 
downwards and backwards to below middle of sides, the bars about as 
wide as the interspaces; fins, dusky-olive; the anal fin and lower rays 
of caudal yellow ; ventrals, orange-yellow, dusky towards tips ; lower 
side of head very bright silvery ; inside of mouth, and lining of gill- 
cavity, as well as cheeks and opercles, with some light yellow. 

Head, 3^ in length; depth, 3. D. X, 1, 25-26; A. II, 5-G. Scales : 41 
oblique series, 54 vertical series, 5 above lateral line, 10 below. 

Head rather larger and less compressed, with less oblique gape, than 
in L. breviceps, and the body much less compressed and elevated. Gape 
placed at an angle of about 25°. Teeth, uniserial, uniform, very small. 
Mandible less projecting than in breviceps and argentevs, the symphyseal 
knob little marked. Head above cavernous, spongy, as in Scicena 
laneeolata. Preorbital narrow, but little widened below, its width 
rather less than diameter of pupil ; maxillary about reaching posterior 
margin of pupil, 2 in head. Eye large, 3f to 3f in head, much longer 
than siiont. equal to interorbital width. Preojiercular margin nearly

vertical, entire, inconspicuously striate. Gill-rakers -14, very long, 1^ 
in orbit. 

First dorsal spine short, the spines thence increasing to the fourth, 
which is 2^0 times in head; longest soft ray equals length of snout and 
eye. Caudal double-truncate, 1^ in head. Base of anal fin rather less 
than diameter of eye, the second spine strong, about one- third head, and 
two-thirds the longest anal ray. Pectorals as long as head, not quite 
reaching vertical from vent. Yentrals, 1^ in head. 

Series of scales run nearly to tips of all the vertical fins, except spi- 
nous dorsal; ventrals likewise scaly. 

88. Cynoscion maculatum (Mitch.) GiU.— Salmon Trout. 

An abundant food-fish, caught with seines in muddy channels in the 
harbor. 

89. Cynoscion regale (Bl. Sclin.) Gill.— Trowf; Shad-Trout. 
Less abundant than the preceding. 

90. Cynoscion nothum Holbrook. — Bastard Trout. 

Caught mostly outside the harbor, where it can be found at all sea- 
sons, though most abundant in summer. It is never so abundant as the 
other species of the genus, and though occasionally reaching a length 
of 3 feet, the specimens caught are mosOy of small size; the largest 
seen by us was about 12 inches long. It is universally known to the 
fishermen as "bastard trout," the belief prevailing that being unspotted 
and still evidently a "trout," it must be a cross between maculatum 
or regale, and some silvery species, as the "whiting." 

Color in life, grayish-silvery above, and on sides to lower level of pec- 
torals; then abruptly silvery; upper parts thickly punctulate with 
darker; inconspicuous dark streaks follow the rows of scales above, 
formed by the darker centers of the scales. Snout and tip of lower jaw- 
blackish; mouth white within. Anal and ventrals white, other fins 
dusky. 

Head 3^ to 3§ in length; depth, 4. D. IX, I, 29; A. I, 9. Scales, 58 
(oblique series or pores) ; 70 vertical series. L. 8 inches. 

Body well compressed; lower jaw distinctly projecting; maxillary 
2^ in head, reaching sUghtly beyond pupil ; teeth in lower jaw anteri- 
orly small, in a very narrow band ; laterally enlarged and in a single 
series; upper jaw with a very narrow band in front and on sides, the 
outer row enlarged ; one or two long, slender canines in front. A deep 
pit on each side of vomer. 

Eye large, longer than snout, or than interorbital width, 4 in head. 
Preopercle very broad, the angle much produced backwards, the thin 
membranaceous portion with conspicuous radiarting striae. Opercle 
terminating in two very long, slender spines, the membrane continued 
beyond them. Gill-rakers long and strong, f in number, the longest 
one-half orbit.

Spinous dorsal not liigii, connected with the second by a low mem- 
brane; the third spine the highest, about 2f in head, the upper mar- 
gin of the fin descending obliquely in a straight line; soft dorsal little 
lower than spinous. First three or four spines with series of scales be- 
hind them ; a well-developed scaly sheath at base of soft dorsal and 
anal ; both fins being thickly scaled to tip. Anal spine small, firmly 
imbedded in the scaly membrane. Pectorals and ventrals also scaled,

Common in the harbor. 

It is undoubtedly to this species that we must refer the S2)ariis radi- 
atus of Linnaius, received from the coast of Carolina through Dr. Gar- 
den. As Garden made most of his collections at Charleston, it is most 
highly probable that this, rather than PL cyanostigma, was the species 
sent by him, the latter never having been recorded north of Key West. 
In addition, we have points in Linnseus's description (" Green above, 
sides purple, head with blue lines, variegated with greenish-yellow. 
Opercle tvith a imryJe and a yellow sjwV^) which answer very well to 
our Carolina specimens, but could not well apply to P. cyanostigma. 

Color in life : Pinkish olive above, whitish below, a narrow, vertical, 
vivid blue or green line across the middle of each scale, the line usually 
convex forwards. Adults in life with traces only of two broad dark 
longitudinal bands on sides, the upper running from opercular spot to 
base of tail, the lower from below base of pectoral, very narrow and 
obscure, vanisliing on middle of body ; the young show this marking 
much more plainly; it is occasionally very conspicuous in adults, 
though usually appearing as indistinct <larker shades on back and 
sides. An olive green streak nearly as wide as eye running uj^wards 
and backwards from orbit to sides of nape, thence along back and 
parallel with it; another green streak above this from eye to nape, 
where it meets its fellow. Head pinkish-bronze, overlaid with greenish- 
yellow on cheeks and opercles below eye ; the latter area is bounded 
above and behind by a narrow blue line i^assing from snout in a wavy 
course below eye to near posterior margin of opercle, where it turns 
abruptly downwards and forwards; opercular flap greenish, ocellated

with light blue ; an intense dark blue spot at upper angle of opercle, 
surroimtled above and below with some greenish bronze margined with 
a light blue line ; the green streak backwards and upwards from eye 
tapers to a point anteriorly, and is margined by a <-shaped blue line; 
lower jaw with two blue cross-bands; subopercle with two or three blue 
spots or streaks ; branchiostegal membrane blue mesially. 

Dorsals narrowly margined with blue; below this a broad streak of 
orange red ; then one of greeuishyellow, bordered below with blue (this 
median streak distinctly black in one specimen); then a streak of pur- 
plish, separated from the greenish-yellow area at base by an oblique 
line running downwards and backwards on the membrane between 
each two rays. Caudal with five concentric, more or less irregular, 
bars alternately of reddish and of greenish-yellow margined with blue, 
the bars strongly convex posteriorly; a terminal blue-black bar, much 
widest at corners of flu; anal pinkish, with a broad median greenish 
bar, margined above and below with blue ; the fin with a narrow blue 
margin, and a blue spot at base of each ray; in a second specimen the 
anal is greenish-yellow, with the median band lighter, and the blue 
markings as described. Ventrals translucent, pinkish-brown towards 
tips, with a blue streak before each ray; pectorals light bluish or green- 
ish, without decided markings, light at base. 

Head = depth, 3J to 3J in length ; 2G or 27 pores in lateral line. 
D. IX, 11; A. Ill, 12. 

Maxillary 34 in head ; teeth large, the posterior canines well devel-

Last rays of dorsal highest, scarcely reaching base of caudal, 2^ in 
head. Caudal (from true base of rays) If in head; pectorals li|; ven- 
trals If. 

Seven specimens were procured, from C to 7 inches in length.

This species was not seen in life, but numerous specimens are in the 
museum at Charleston, having been taken in the harbor, where it is 
said to be not rare. We cannot doubt that this, and not X. lineatus C. 
& v., is the species described by Linnteus as Conjpluma Uneafa. The 
specimens described by Linnaeus w^ere sent from Cliarleston by Dr. Gar- 
den; the color given agrees well with our fish, while •' lineatm C. & V." 
has not "the dorsal and anal fins painted with lines." X. lineatus C. & Y. 
has apparently not been seen since the original description, and there is 
no probability that it reaches our coasts. No dift'erences have ever been 
pointed out between our species and tbe Mediterranean X. novacula, but 
Labroids are not as a rule fishes of wide distribution, and it is wiser to 
retain our name until a comparison of the two forms has been made.

Our alcoholic specimen shows about six narrow blue lines on the 
snout, these augulated below and continued across the interopercle; 
scales with very narrow vertical blue lines, with some interspersed blue 
dots ; anal fin with very evident broad vertical blue streaks.

Frequently taken in the harbor. The comparison made by us (Proc. 
U. S. Nat. Mus. 1882, 289) between examples from the Gulf {''anoplus^') 
and y-griGcum was with specimens of very unequal size, those of the 
former being 3 J inches long, while those of the latter were nearly adult. 
Specimens now in our possession froui Charleston, less than 5 inches 
long, and evidently the same as an adult of y-grwcum from the same 
localit}^, enable us to make a more satisfactory comparison, and show 
that the characters supposed to distinguish our Gulf specimens are due 
to their immature condition only. Thus the bones cuirassing the top of 
the head become narrower with age; the Y-shaped process becomes 
.much narrower, and has the fork proportionally shorter; the profuse 
black-specking on body behind, still visible in specimens 5 inches long, en- 
tirely disappears in adults ; and the white spots on body l)ecome much 
larger in proportion to size of eye. We strongly doubt the existence of 
a second species of Astroscopus in our waters. In case such should be 
demonstrated, it would still be very probable that the anoplos of C. & V., 
based on a specimen two inches long, was the young of ygr cecum, every- 
where common on our southern coasts. 

96. Culms amblyopsis Cope. 

A single specimen, 4 inches long, was taken in the harbor. 

Color in spirits; brown, lighter above and below; each scale on mid- 
dle of sides with a dusky streak, these forming obscure lengthwise 
lines; back anteriorly with a few small, black spots; under parts, in- 
<}luding sides of head, very thickly punctulate with black. Lips black; 
a dark streak from snout through eye to upper angle of preopercle; 
two duskj' streaks from eye downwards and backwards across cheeks; 
a very couspicuous black blotch as large as eye in front of the upper 
pectoral rays. Pectorals and ventrals transparent, dusky; vertical fins 
>all barred with light and dark in fine pattern.

esses protruding before it; lower jaw longest; maxillary reaching ver- 
tical behind pupil, 2f in head. 

Teeth in the jaws in narrow, villiform bands, becoming a single series 
on sides of lower jaw; those of the outer and inner series in each jaw 
are somewhat enlarged, the largest being the single series in sides of 
lower jaw. Preopercular spine as usual in the genus. 

Scales smooth above and below, ctenoid on sides. 

Head 31 in length; depth 4^. D. VI-9; A. 9. Lat. 1. 48. Eye 6f in

97. Gobius encaeomus sp. uov. (29673.) 

Three specimens, two males and one female, were obtained in tide- 
pools in the harbor, the largest I'l inches in length. The type is num- 
bered 29,673 on the register of the United States National Museum. 

Colors in life : S light olivaceous, mottled above with darker olive 
brown ; a series of about 4 obscure oblong dark blotches along middle 
of sides; a dark spot at base of caudal ; each side of nape with an intense 
blue-black spot larger than eye; an obscure dusky streak from eye for- 
ward to mouth ; a small dusky spot sometimes i)resent on upper portion 
of base of pectorals. Both dorsals translucent, with series of bright red- 
dish-brown spots, as large as pupil ; upper lobe of caudal light reddish, 
the lower lobe blue-black. Anal and ventrals dusky-bluish ; pectorals 
slightly dusky, with a narrow, bright pink border behind. 

$ without bright markings ; body light olive, with 5 oblong dark 
blotches on sides, the last on base of caudal ; from each of the three 
middle blotches a V-shaped bar runs to the back (these visible also in 
males); back somewhat mottled with dusky; a black blotch on scapula; 
a small one on opercle ; a dark bar from eye forward to mouth. Vertical 
tins with dusky streaks, these appeariug on caudal in the form of cross- 
bars. Ventrals light, with two lengthwise dark streaks ; pectorals 
plaib. 

Head 4 in length ; depth 5f . D. VI-11 ; A. 12. Lat. 1. about 37 (a 
few of the anterior scales gone, the count, therefore, not certain). 

Body very elongate, much tapering backwards ; head compressed, the 
cheeks high and vertical ; snout very short, compressed, obtusely 
rounded vertically. Mouth nearly hoiizontal, low, large, the maxillary 
one-half head, nearly reaching vertical from posterior margin of orbit. 
Teeth in very narrow bands in both jaws, those of the outer series in 
the upper jaw much enlarged; eyes inserted high, the interorbital space 
very naxrow, about as wide as pupil ; diameter of orbit much greater 
than snout, nearly one-third head. Gill-opening 2J in head ; the isthmus 
wide. Dorsals contiguous, the membrane of spinous dorsal reaching 
nearly to base of soft dorsal ; dorsal spines high, of nearly uniform length, 
the last reaching well beyond origin of soft dorsal when depressed ; 
the longest spine about half length of head. Soft dorsal and anal long

and liigh, tlie posterior rays of both fins reaching at least to base of 
caudal when depressed. Candal hmceolate, the middle rays produced, 
2§ in body. Veutrals reaching vent, somewhat longer than pectorals, 
wliich about equal length of head ; ventral sheath well developed, its 
length two-sevenths that of fin. 

Body wholly covered with large, strongly ctenoid scales, which are 
much reduced in size anteriorly ; head, ante-dorsal region, and breast 
naked. 

In the female specimen, the mouth is evidently smaller, and the caudal 
less elongate. 

99. Gobius thalassinus sp. nov. (29574.) 

Closely allied to G. emblematicus J. & G. 

Head and body translucent, overlaid by brilliant green luster, which 
is formed by exceedingly minute close-set green points ; the luster is 
intense towards the head, w^here it assumes a blue tint, and becomes 
hardly noticeable on caudal i^eduncle; three conspicuous translucent 
bars wider than the interspaces, crossing body immediately behind 
head; head with tAVO brilliant narrow blue or green lines running 
obliquely across cheeks below eye; opercle with greenish luster; 
branchiostegal membrane white. Dorsals whitish, with two or three 
lengthwise series of large reddish-brown spots ; spinous dorsal black- 
ish at base. Upper caudal rays marked with red, the lower i^ortion of 
caudal, and the most of the anal fin blackish, anal whitish at base, the 
anterior rays tipped with brilliant white. Ventrals light buff. Pector- 
als translucent. In spirits the body appears dusted with dark points ; 
two light cross-bars towards head; lower part of caudal and anal 
black. 

Head 3^ in length; depth 4^. D. VII-IO ; A. 15. 

Body elongate, mucli compressed, highest in front of ventrals, thence 
tapering regularly to a very narrow, short, caudal peduncle; the body 
with a peculiar, translucent, fragile ai)pearance, common also to G. 
emblematicus. Head compressed, much higher than wide ; snout very 
short, acute, the preorbital not as wide as pupil ; mouth terminal, very 
wide and oblique, the jaws equal; maxillary reaching vertical from mid- 
dle of orbit, one-half length of head; teeth in a narrow baud in each 
jaw, the outer series enlarged, canine-like (under a microscope the band 
of small teeth behind the outer series seems evident, but the size of our 
specimens does not enable us to verify it with certainty) ; eyes placed 
high, separated by a narrow ridge, the diameter about one-third length 
of head. 

Dorsals very closely contiguous ; spines very slender, the fifth slightly 
produced and filamentous, reaching (in our specimens) to base of third 
soft ray when depressed ; caudal lanceolate, very long and pointed, the 
middle rays produced, 2?- in body : pectorals as long as head; the upper 
rays not silk-like ; ventrals with basal membrane well developed; the

fin long, reacLing to or slightly beyond front of anal, somewhat louger 
than head. 

Body covered with rather small cycloid scales ; head naked ; the scales 
are very readily deciduous ; as they have in our specimeus mostly fallen 
off, the count cannot be given. 

Two specimens, the largest 1^ inches long (No. 29674, U. S. Kat. Mus.), 
were taken in muddy tide-pools in Charleston Harbor. The species has 
thus mnch the habit of its congener, G. emhlcmaUcus, from Panama.

Gobionellus kastntiis Grd., U. S. Mex. Bonn. Surv. 18r)9,24. 

A single specimen, 11 inches long, was taken in the harbor. 

Color in spirits, reddish olive ; a distinct, round, blackish blotch below 
spinous dorsal, twice as large as orbit; an indistict dusky shade along 
middle of sides, terminating in a distinct dusky blotch on base of caudal ; 
middle of sides with a series of < -shaped marks, formed by very narrow 
veiny lines widely diverging backwajds ; a similar narrow^ line from eye 
to maxillary, and one from eye backwards to upper angle of preopercle ; 
evident traces of the emerald spot at base of tongue ; two small dark 
spots on first dorsal spine; spinous dorsal dusky, with a light and a dusky 
streak at base; soft dorsal dusky, a light (fblnish in life) area behind 
each ray ; anterior rnys barred with light and tlark ; anal and ventrals 
whitish (probably blue in life), the ventrals with ont dark markings; 
pectorals dusky, the base lighter, and with some indistinct dusky bars ; 
a dusky half-bar on npper part of axil. 

Head 6 in length (Si in total) ; depth Si. Eye 5 in head ; ventrals= 
pectorals=head; D. VI— 14; A. 1, 14. 

Upper part of opercle with a broad patch of abont 20 scales, arranged 
in 4 series ; head otherwise naked. Scales on body very small, becom- 
ing much larger behind ; arranged in 80 cross-series. 

All the dorsal spines more or less filamentous. Caudal fin nearly 
one-third total length. 

There is apparently another species very closely related to oceanicus, 
and occurring with it in the West Indies. This is represented in our 
collection by a specimen from Colon, U. S. C, and appears to be char- 
acterized by a longer head (a in length, 7 in total), by the much larger 
scales (CO in lateral line), by the obsolescence of the patch of scales 
on opercles, and by different coloration. GoUus lanceoJafus C. & V. and 
Gohionellus lanceolatus, Poey, Syn, Pise. Cub., 393, seem to refer to this 
latter species. 

101. Gobiosoma bosci (LaC.) J. & G. 

Very abundant along the mnddy shores of lagoons, hiding in oyster- 
shells and holes in the mud.

Trifjla 2)almij)es, Mitch. Trans. Lit. and Phil. Soc. N. Y., I. 43L 

Prionotus carolinus, C. & V., iv, 90. 

Evidently not abundant in Southern waters, no specimens being ob- 
taiued by us during the summer. Several examples are, however, pre- 
served in the Charleston museum, Irom the coast of South Carolina. 
Linnieus' description of Trigla Carolina appbes almost equallj^ well 
to auy of our species. The fin formula given by him ("D. X — 13; A. 
12 ") is found commonly only in the present species and in scUulus, but 
this does not lend any high degree of probability to the identification. 
We must, therefore, make use of Mitchill's name palmipes, it having 
been given prior to the use of carolinus, definitely for this species, by 
Cuvier and Valenciennes. 

104. Prionotus scitulus J. & G. — Sea BoMii. 

Not rare, several specimens having been obtained. Probably not 
reaching as large a size as other species of the genus, the largest exam- 
ples seen being but 5^ inches long. 

The coloration given by us (Proc. U. S. ]^at. Mus., 1882, 288) was 
apparently drawn from a female specimen. The following is the life 
color of the male : 

Light oUve brown, with four saddle like dark blotches on back, one 
downwards and forwards from middle of spinous dorsal to humeral spine; 
a second from front of soft dorsal ; a third from end of dorsal downwards 
and forwards to below lateral line, thence continued forwards as a nar- 
row horizontal streak ,• a fourth on caudal peduncle ; sides everywhere 
with reddish-brown spots, as in the female. Opercle reddish-brown; 
branchiostegal membrane, and palatine region largely jetblack. Spin- 
ous dorsal olive-brown, with two irregular lengthwise translucent streaks 
and an intense well-defined black spot on membrane above, between 
fourth and fifth spines. Second dorsal olive-brown vermiculated with 
whitish translucent, and without round spots. Caudal reddish-brown, 
blackish towards tip, with a conspicuous white longitudinal streak on 
upper lobe. Anal blackish, with white base and margin. Pectoral dark 
brown, irregularly barred and blotched with greenish and light brown. 
Free rays of pectorals, and inner face of ventrals dusky, tinged with 
orange. 

Head 2a to 3; depth 5^ to (5; D. X— 13; A. 12. Longest dorsal spine 
(in S) If in head; jjcctoral fin 2^to2f in body. Preopercular spine 
with an inconspicuous cusp above and one below its base ; small speci- 
mens show also inconspicuous spinous teeth on preorbital.

This form is in many respects intermediate between P. strigatua C. & 
v., and P. trihulus C. & V. The color is In most particulars like that 
of trihulus, but the white spots on back and sides are much less numer- 
ous, or wholly wanting, and the brown bar bacliward from humeral 
spine is present, as in strigatuSj and the dorsal fin is not barred ; the 
gill rakers are, as in strigatus, slender and fine, 18 to 20 developed on 
lower limb ; the spines on the head are not strong as in tribuhis, that 
above orbit behind not conspicuously raised above surface of head ; in 
two specimens from Beaufort, N. C, the pectorals are much lengthened, 
reaching nearly to base of caudal, but this seems to be here, as in tribu- 
lus, a very variable feature, as specimens from Charleston have the pec- 
torals but one-half length of body. 

Head 2f in length ; depth 4^. D. X— 12 ; A. 11. 

Lat. 1. 53 (pores). Soft dorsal high, the longest ray = longest spine, 
2J in head ; caudal 3| in length. 

Color in life, olive-brown above, becoming light olive on sides, white 
below ; back with three brown cross-bars, the first under spinous dorsal, 
the second under first third of second dorsal, the third under its end, 
all of these bars extending downwards and forwards to lateral line, the 
posterior forming a brown blotch on base of last dorsal rays; back and 
sides with numerous small w^hite spots, irregular in shape and size : 
these often wantiiig; a lateral line running in a narrow brown streak ; 
distinct broad reddish-brown streak from humeral spine backwards to 
opposite end of anal ; traces of a narrow streak above this. Branchios- 
tegal membrane yellowish above ; a dark brown streak from angle of 
mouth to base of preopercular spine ; opercle dusky brown without, 
deep reddish-brown within. Caudal with a light brown bar at base, 
then a broad translucent bar, the terminal two-thirds orange-yellow, 
narrowly margined behind with white. 

Spinous dorsal dusky, with a diffuse black blotch between fourth and 
sixth rays above; soft dorsal translucent brownish, without streaks of 
any kind; anal wine-color, translucent at base and tip. Ventrals light 
reddish. Pectorals glaucous green within, the lower rays reddish, the 
upper white ; the outer side dark greenish-brown, unbarred, with a very 
narrow blue margin behind. 

The description given by Linnaeus of " Trigla evolans,^^ is too meager 
to permit identification, and the name should therefore not be used for 
any of our species. We are obliged also to reject the name lineata as 
applied to our northern species, the Trigla lineata of Mitchill being 
merely a mistaken identification of Trigla lineata Bloch, as described by

Abundant in the harbor, but much less so than the following species. 
It does not reach as large a size as dentatus, and is much less valuable 
as a food-fish. The largest specimen obtained is about 1 foot long. 
This species has by recent writers been confounded with dcnfatns, along 
with which it occurs on both northern and southern portions of our East 
coast. From dentatus it is readily distinguishable by the ocellated spots, 
the narrow, interorbital, and especially by the slender, more numerous 
gill-rakers. 

Color iu life: Light olive-brown; adults with very numerous small 
white spots on body and vertical fins; sometimes a series of larger 
white spots along bases of dorsal and anal fins; about 14 ocellated dark 
spots on sides, these sometimes little conspicuous, but always present ; 
a series of 4 or 5 along base of dorsal, and 3 or 4 along base of anal, 
those of the two series opposite, and forming pairs ; two pairs of smaller 
less distincts spots midway between these basal series and lateral line 
anteriorily, with a small one on lateral line in the center between them ; 
a large distinct spot on lateral line behind middle of straight portion ; 
fins without the round dark blotches cbaracteristic of dentatus. 

Head 3* to 4 in length; depth 2f ; eye C in head; maxillary 2; 
pectoral 24-; ventral 3J ; caudal peduncle 4; caudal l^. D. SO to 91. 
A. 65 to 71. Lat. 1. 108 (tubes). Curve of lateral line 3§ to 4^- in straight 
portion. 

Gill-rakers comparatively long and slender, 5 -f 15 to 6 -f 18 in number. 
Length 12 inches. 

Teeth as in dentatus, very long, in a single series, those in lower jaw 
larger. 

Scales smooth ; the posterior margin of each scale of colored side be- 
set with a row of minute accessory scales. 

116. Paraliclithys dentatus (Linn. ) J. & G. — Flomuler. 

The only flounder of much value for food found at Charleston. It is 
much more numerous than other species, and reaches a larger size. 
Specimens were seen 2^ feet long. 

This species is readily distinguished by the nearly uniform dark olive- 
brown coloration, without a trace of ocellated spots; the fins are plain, 
with characteristic round, dusky blotches ; the interorbital space is, iu 
adults, wide and flat; the gill-rakers are comparatively short and strong, 
very constantly 2 + 9 in number, rarely 3 + 10. 



618 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

There is nothing in Linnajus's description of dentatus to indicate that 
he had the present species rather than occllaris. But as the original 
type of dentatus is still j)reserved by the Linnaean Society of London, 
judgment may be suspended until a re-examination of this has been 
made. 

117. Citharichthys spilopterus Giinther. 

Very common in the harbor, where numerous specimens were ob- 
tained. Compared with a large series from Mazatlan, Mexico, our Atlan- 
tic form differs constantly in having the interorbital space consisting of 
a single sharp, knife-like ridge, while those from the Pacific have the in- 
terorbital space broader, three-fourths width of pupil, and composed of 
two ridges with a groove between them. The Charleston specimens 
have constantly the depth slightly less, and the coloration much lighter. 
In spite of the slightness of the differences noted it is i)robable that the 
Pacific form is worthy of separation as a subspecies. 

Head Sa-Sf in length; depth 2^-2^. D. 70; A. 5S. Lat. 1. 45 (pores). 
Eye 5 J in head; maxillary 21; pectoral 1|. Gill-rakers 14 on lower limb. 

117. Etropus crossotus Jor. & Gilb. 

Abundant. Specimens observed differ from those from Panama in 
slightly greater depth, which is more than half length of body. 

118. Achiriis lineatiis (Linu.) Cuv. 

{Solca hroivnii Giiutber, iv, 477.) 

Very abundant. Specimens with the left side plain whitish, and those 
having it covered with dusky spots, are equally common. Some were also 
observed with the eyeless side dusky, but not spotted. As no other dif- 
ferences could be appreciated, it is not probable that this difference in 
coloration is significant of specific distinctness. 

119. Aphoristia plagiusa (Liun.) J. & G. — Tongue-Jish. 
Not rare. 

120. Pterophrynoides histrio (Liuu.) Gill.

A single specimen obtained on the fishing bank, caught with hook- 
and-line in 10 fathoms of water. The caudal peduncle shows the char- 
acteristic lengthened setae, and the first dorsal ray is produced and fili- 
form. The species is evidently not abundantly found at Charleston.

The description given by Linuajus of Balistes Mspidus is based on a 
specimen, evidently of the i)resent species, received by him from Sonth 
Carolina through Dr. Garden. The body was " hispid, roughened to- 
wards the tail with sette." A reference is also made by Linnaius to 
the account given by Seba of Monacantlms longirostris. This, however, 
cannot invalidate a description made from a specimen in hand, and the 
name his2}idus must be used for our species. 

123. Ostracium quadricorne Ijhin.—Cow-Jiah. 
Very common. 

124. Lagocephalus lasvigatus (Linu.) Gill. 
Two specimens seen. 

125. Tetrodon turgidus Mitcli. 
Common. 

From specimens of T. nephelus in our collection from Pensacola and 
Galveston, this species differs conspicuously in its coloration, in having 
the snout entirely covered with spines, and in having all the spines short 
and immovable. T. nephehts has a broad space below eye, and the snout, 
with exception of a small median patch above, naked, and the spines of 
head and body are longer, slender, and erectile. 

126. Cliilomyctertis geometricus (Bl. & Schu.) GiW.—rin-cushion. 
Very abundant. 

Very young specimens have the body soft and flabby, with the spines 
admitting of considerable movement because of the looseness of the 
skin ; the caudal peduncle is scarcely noticeable ; the belly is often of 
purplish black, with pink spines.

gutta. 

Prionotus imnctsitns =Prionotus scitulus. 

Prionotus evoliins,= Prionotus sarritor. 

Carangus chvysus= Caranjc bcani type (probably youug of Caraiix 
ruber.) 

Chirostoma mQniCd\xm=MenkVia bosci and laciniata. 

Belone hians = the young, probably, of Tylosurus caribbcvus. 

Under the heading of Lophopsetta maculata, it should have been 
stated that the species was admitted to the list on the authority of Dr. 
Yarrow, but was not seen by us.

DESflJKaPTBOIVS OF THREE IVEW SPECIES. 

By DAVSD S. JOBDAIV and CHABI.ES H. GILBERT. 

About the year 1866 a considerable collection of fishes was made at 
Panama and in the neighboring Pearl Islands, by the late Prof. Frank 
H. Bradley. These specimens are now preserved in the museum of 
Yale College. By the courtesy of Prof. A. E. Yerrill they have been 
placed in our hands for determination. We give here a list of the 
species contained in the collection, with remarks on some of the more 
interesting forms. Three species appear to be still undescribed, and a 
very large proportion of the others were unknown at the time the col- 
lection was made. A series of duplicates has been presented by Profes- 
sor Yerrill to the National Museum. Unless otherwise stated, all the 
species mentioned were obtained at Panama, by Professor Bradley. 
1. Ginglymostoma cirratum (Gmel.) M. & H. 

A single young example. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 621 

2. Mustelus sii. 

f f Mustelus mento Cope, Proc. Am. Pliilos. Soc. XVII, 1877, 47. 

Three specimens, each about 10 inches long, in poor condition. The 
fins are mnch larger than in M. himilatus, the space between dorsals 
being bnt twice base of first dorsal and 2^ times base of second. The 
color is also much darker, that of the fins nearly uniform dusky, with 
lighter edges. M. lumilatns was hitherto known only from Mazatlan, 
unless indeed Mustelus mento Cope, from Peru, should prove to be the 
same. 

3. Urolophus halleri Cooper. 

Two specimens. The species has now a recorded range from Panama 
to Point Conception, Cal. It is abundant onlj^ along the northern part 
of this range, from San Diego to Santa Barbara. 

4. Syrrhina exasperata (Jor. & Gilb.) Garmau. 

Two adult female specimens, each over 20 inches long, are in the col- 
lection made by Mr. Bradley at Panama. The species was hitherto 
known only from Southern California, and was represented in collections 
by numerous immature males collected by ourselves at San Diego, and 
by a single adult male (type of Trygonorliina alveata Garman) in the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge. 

The following points in regard to these female specimens are worthy 
of note : The general plan of coloration is the same as in males, includ- 
ing the large black blotch covering posterior angles of i3ectorals below ; 
the u])per side of disk has, however, several round yellowish spots as 
large as pupil, each spot ocellated with blackish ; a very distinct spot 
on each side of shoulder; a second on pectoral fins near posterior angle; 
and a third midway between the latter and median line of back ; several 
other less conspicuous spots near middle of back anteriorly. The dis- 
position of spines and prickles above is the same as in males ; but below, 
the entire surface of body and tail is covered with uniform fine shagreen, 
instead of being largely naked. 

Disk somewhat broader than long, the length slightly greater than 
that of tail. 

5. Arms brandti Steind. 

6. Arius alattis Steiiid. 

Two specimens, each about 10 inches long. Head 3f in length ; maxil- 
lary barbel reaching nearly to tip of pectoral spine. 

7. Arius kessleri Steiud. 

A single specimen shows the following characters: Head very coarsely 
granulai", the occipital process narrowly triangular and sharply keeled, 
rounded posteriorly; the antedorsal shield very narrow, about half 
diameter of orbit. Humeral process with few granulations. Maxillary 
barbel barely reaching base of pectoral spine. Vomerine patch of teeth 
much narrowed toward median line, and divided by a furrow, Fon- 
tanelle club-shaped. 



622 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

8. Arius insculptus Jor. & Gilb. 

Three specimens. Head with very fiue and unmerons granulations ; 
occipital process very wide, truncate posteriorly, sometimes with fluted 
margin into which fit projections from the antedorsal shield ; the latter 
is wide. Humeral process with very fine numerous granulations. Fon- 
tanelle tapering to a point posteriorly. Barbels much longer than in 
Icessleri, the maxillary barbel reaching beyond first third of pectoral 
spine. Vomerine patch of teeth not divided on median line. 

9. Arius planiceps Steiiid. 

A male and a female of this species, each about 10 inches long, differ 
somewhat from those examined by Dr. iSteindachner, and from each 
other. In the male the head is very long, 3^ in body; in the female, 4 
in body. The maxillary barbels in the male are short, not reaching 
base of pectoral spine, and the granulation of the cephalic plates is 
much less marked, the granules on occipital process scarcely larger or 
more thickly set than on rest of head. In both specimens the occipital 
process is broader at the base, and much more tapering posteriorly than 
is represented in the figure given by Dr. Steindachner. None of the 
specimens examined by us show any distinct trace of a median furrow 
through the vomerine patch of teeth. 

10. Arius dasycephalus Gthr. 

11. -3E31urichthys panamensis Gill. 

12. -Slurichthys piunimaculatus Steind. 

12. Albula vulpes (L.) Goode. 

13. Elops saurus Linn. 

14. Opisthonema libertate (Gilnth.) J. & G. 

This species differs apparently from thrissa in the absence of dark 
spots on the scales of the back, in the longer and more numerous gill- 
rakers, and in the longer head. In libertate, the head varies from 3f 
(in young) to 4^^ (in adults) ; in thrissa, from 4 to 44. Libertate is bluish 
or greenish above, silvery on sides and below, a yellowish-olive streak 
on level of orbit. A small indistinct black spot at ui^per angle of pre- 
opercle, and a larger more distinct one on scapula. Dorsal olive-yellow, 
with dusky margin; caudal dusky, the lobes tipped with jet black; 
upper rays of pectorals dusky. Tip of snout and lining membrane of 
opercle black. 

A specimen of 0. thrissa is also in the collection, reputed to have been 
taken by Professor Bradley at Panama. We prefer not to admit it to 
the list from the Pacific coa.st until its occurrence there is verified. 

15. Stolephorus panamensis (Steind.) J. & G. 

Two specimens, about 5 inches long, with anal rays respectively 33 
and 37 in number. 

16. stolephorus miarchus Jor. & Gilb. 

Many small slender anchovies collected by Professor Bradley in the 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 623 

Pearl Islands belong to this species. They are of the same size and 
general apj)earance as the original types from Mazatlan. The anal 
rays are qnite constantly 13, and the body is exceedingly slender, the 
depth being about | the length. 

17. Pcecilia elongata Giiuther. 

18. Ophisurus xysturus Jor. & Gilb. 

Three fine examples, the • longest 28 inches long, from Mazatlan, 
Acapulco, and Panama, respectively. These specimens vary from tlie 
original types from Mazatlan in the following respects : The vomerine 
patch of teeth is broader, with a well-marked constriction anteriorly, 
with teeth arranged in about three irregular series ; the eye is con- 
tained twice in snout, which is f interorbital space ; length of pectoral 
less than width of gill-opening. The dark spots are arranged more 
regularly, those of the upjier two series nearly equal in number. The 
specimen from Mazatlan has the spots of the upper two series corre- 
sponding, while in the other two specimens they alternate. Spots on 
dorsal fin distinct, not confluent. In the smallest specimen (from Pan- 
ama) the head is contained but three times in the trunk. 

19. Ophichthys zophochir Jor, & Gilb. 

A fine specimen, about 2 feet long, collected by Mr. J. A. Sutter at Aca- 
pulco. The species was hitherto known only from Mazatlan Harbor. 

20. Sidera panamensis (Steind.) J. & G. 

Mura'na imiiamensis Stemdachner, Iclitli. Beitr. V, 19 ; uot Sidera lyanamensis 
J. & G., Bull. U. S. Fish. Com., 1882, 106 = Sidera castanea J. & G., MSS. 

Three specimens from Pearl Islands, the largest 10 inches long, an- 
swer perfectly to Steindachner's description of this species. 

21. Sidera verrilli sp. nov. 

A single specimen in the Yale College Museum, 17J inches long, col- 
lected by Professor Bradley at Panama, serves as the type of the fol- 
lowing description : 

Body comparatively slender, the tail about equal to the rest of the 
body. Head 3| in length of trunk. Cleft of mouth moderate, 3 in 
head. Mandible somewhat curved, and the teeth very long, so that 
the mouth does not admit of being completely closed. 

Teeth everywhere uniserial, those on sides of mandible strong, com- 
pressed, hooked backwards, about 13 in number on each side, the teeth 
growing gradually smaller backwards, those next angle of mouth very 
small ; 4 or 5 anterior teeth on each side very large, subequal. Teeth 
of upper jaw in all respects similar to those in the lower, and in equal 
number. A short row of very small teeth on vomer posteriorly ; the 
anterior canines wanting in our specimen (perhaps lost); teeth all ap- 
parently entire. 

Eye rather large, somewhat nearer angle of mouth than tip of snout, 



624 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

its diameter about half lengtli of snout. Gill-opeuing small, scarcely 
wider than orbit. Tube of anterior nostril rather short, less than half 
eye. Posterior nostril above front of eye. Occipital region little 
prominent. 

Dorsal tin rather high, commencing nearly midway between gill- 
opening and eye, its greatest height rather more than half greatest 
depth of body. 

Color, in spirits, light chestnut brown, finely freckled, but without 
distinct spots of any kind. Dorsal with a conspicuous edge of blackish, 
the margin narrowly white. Anal edged with white. No black about 
eye or gill-opening 

22. Murasna'' melanotis (Kanp.) Gtbr. 

A specimen, 22 inches long, has the teeth everywhere uniserial, other- 
wise agreeing with descriptions of melanotis. Bodj" and fins dark brown, 
marbled with blackish, everywhere with small yellowish spots much 
more numerous anteriorly, those on the tail narrowly oblong. Angle of 
mouth, and a large roundish blotch around gilt-slit black, this blotch 
nearly four times as wide as orbit. 

Eye over middle of gape, which is 2f in head. Head 2^- in trunk. 
Tail slightly longer than rest of body. 

23. Tylcsunis pacificus (Steiiul.) J. & G. 

24. Hemirharaphus ? brasiliensis (Liun.) C. & V. 

Two adults, about 15 inches long, agree with specimens collected by 
Mr. Gilbert at Panama, and differ from Atlantic representatives of the 
species in their longer pectoral fins, and in the more anterior inser- 
tion of the ventrals. It is probable that the Pacific form is a distinct 
species (^r subspecies, but our material from the Atlantic is too limited 
to warrant the separation of the former. 

The specimens before us have the pectoral nearly six-sevenths length 
of head (three-fourths in Atlantic specimens) and greater than depth 
of body; the distance from root of ventrals to base of caudal is slightly 
less than one-third distance to front of snout, and measured from base 
of ventrals forwards reaches a point nearer base than tij) of pectorals. 
D. 14; A. 11 or 12. Scales 58. Head 4f in length; lower jaw 5 in total 
length (including caudal). Eye 4i in head, equaling interorbital space. 
The first 3 to G rays of dorsal and anal with series of scales, these fins 
otherwise naked. 

25. Hemirhamphus unifasciatus Raiiz. 

26. Mtigil brasiliensis Agassi z. 

27. Mugil incilis Hiiucock. 

A single adult example with the scales noticeably smaller than in 
M. hrasilienfiis, and the vertical fins lower. Lateral line 43; 14 scales 
in a cross series. Longest dorsal ray less than half length of head.

32. Caranx latus Ag. {=fallax C. & V.) 

33. Caranx hippos (Linn.) J. &, G. 

34. Caranx setipinnis (Mitch.) J. & G. 

This species has a well-developed series of spinous plates along the 
lateral line, as has been already pointed out by Bleeker and Steindach- 
uer. There seems to be no reason why it should not be referred to 
Caranx. 

35. Selene vomer (L.) Liitken. 

36. OligopUtes saurus (Bl. & Schn.) J. & G. 

37. Trachynotus rhomboides (Bloch) Cut. & Val. 

Two small specimens, each IJ inches long, differ from an example of 
the same size from Beaufort, N. C, in the much deeper body (depth If 
in length), and in the greater development of all the spines. The triple 
sj^ine at angle of preopercle is conspicuous, and the highest dorsal and 
anal spines are longer than the soft rays. Body thickly dusted with 
brown points; dorsal and anal blackish. D. VII-18; A. Ill, 17.

53. Pomadasys chalceus (Giinther) J. & G. 

54. Pomadasys brevipinnis (Steind.) J. & G. 

This specimen extends the range of this species from Mazatlan to 
Panama. It may be noticed that the figure given by Dr. Steindachner 
(Ichthyol. IS'otiz,, VIII, Taf. 5) is faulty in several respects. Thus the 
scales with their accompanying dark streaks are represented as oblique 
below the lateral line, whereas in reality they are horizontal. The inter-

626 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

maxillary processes are shown iu the figure to project beyond the line 
of profile, while in the fish nothing breaks the evenly convex outline. 
The accompanying description does not countenance these errors of 
the artist. Dr. Steindachner has more lately (Ichthyol. Beit., II, 8) in- 
correctly identified brevipinnis with Microlepidotus inornatus Gill. The 
latter is a widely different species, with scaleless dorsal and anal and 14 
dorsal spines.

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 627 

81. Scorpaena plumieri Bloch. 

82. Scorpagna sp. 

Four iiij mature specimens, representing apparently two species, both 
distinct from plumieri, are in the collection from Panama and Acajutla. 
They are too small to permit identification. 

83. Gobiesox adustus Jor. & Gilb. 

Two specimens, in fine condition, are in the collection. They were 
obtained by Captain Dow on the coast of Central America. The species 
was hitherto known from Mazatlan only. 

The following ^joints were incorrectly stated in the original descrip- 
tion: Width of head 2| to 3 in length; pectoral one-third to two-fifths 
length of head ; distance from base of caudal to front of dorsal, 2f in 
length of body, 3i in total, including caudal. D. 9 or 10; A. 7 or 8. 

Emblemaria gen. nov. ( Blenniidw.) 

Body slender, not eel-shaped, compressed, scaleless. Ventrals j)resent, 
jugular, each of oue spine and two soft rays. A single dorsal fin begin- 
ning on the nape and extending to the caudal, with which it is not con- 
fluent; no notch between spinous and soft rays. Head cuboid, com- 
pressed, narrowed anteriorly, with much the aspect of OpisthognatJius. 
Symphysis of lower jaw forming a very acute angle. A single series of 
strong, blunt, conical teeth on each jaw, and on vomer and palatines. 
Vomer and palatine teeth larger, their series continuous parallel to the 
series in upper jaw\ Xo cirri anywhere. Gill-openings very wide, the 
membranes broadly united below, free from the isthmus. Lateral line 
obsolete. 

This genus bears some resemblance to Blennius, but the dentition is 
entirely different, approaching that of Chcenopsis. 

84. Emblemaria nivipes sp. nov. (29,676). 

Color in spirits: Sides dark brown, with 8 to 10 lighter vertical bars 
of variable width ; body lighter below^ ; obscure cross-bands on lower side 
of head. Dorsal blackish anteriorly, whitish behind, with membrane at 
intervals of every second, third, or fourth ray dusky ; caudal light at base, 
its tip blackish ; anal dusky-translucent ; ventrals bright white, the basal 
portion dusky. 

Headof in length; depth 7. D. XXIII, 14; A. 25. Body everywhere 
equally compressed, posteriorly tapering; head wider than body, of 
about equal depth, with very short, subvertical, sharply-compressed 
snout; eyes very large, approximated above, with some vertical range; 
orbital ridges sharply raised above, the interorbital region very narrow, 
channeled, about equaling diameter of pupil ; eye 3§ in head. Gape 
very wide, horizontal, low, reaching much beyond eye, the maxillary 
about four-sevenths head, not produced beyond angle of mouth ; inter- 
maxillaries separated by a groove from the snout, this groove continu-

ous for the entire length of the upper jaw, maxillary not evident, appar- 
ently aclnate to the skin of the preorbital. 

First dorsal spine inserted over margin of preopercle ; spines all very 
slender and flexible, the posterior but weakly differentiated from the 
soft rays, the anterior portion of fin very high, the spines filiform, not 
exserted beyond the membrane ; the longest dorsal spine about one- 
third length of body, the last spine about one-half head ; membranes 
of last rays of both dorsal and anal slightly joined to base of caudal. 
Front of anal nearer snout than base of caudal by a distance equaling 
one-tliird length of head. Caudal three-fifths length of head; ventrals 
and pectorals slightly less. 

A specimen 2 inches long, collected by Professor Bradley at the Pearl 
Islands, serves as the type of the species, and is numbered 29,07(3 on 
the register of the U. S. National Museum. Numerous smaller speci- 
mens are in the collection from the same locality. 

85. Cremnobates monophthalmus Giinther. 
86. Salarias mbropunctatus C. & V. 

Six specimens of this species, the longest 3 inches in length, were 
collected by Professor Bradley at the Pearl Islands. The fin rays, 
coloration, and proportions are those assigned this species by Cuvier 
and Valenciennes. In addition, there is a distinct jet-black spot behind 
the eye, with a narrow light edge anteriorly. 

Head = depth, 4 in length (5 in total) ; eye 4.^ in head. D. XI, IG; A. 
20. The teeth are somewhat less flexible than in S. atlanticus, and the 
canines in lower jaw are wholly wanting. 

Specimens of the same species collected by Professor Bradley are in 
the collection from Callao. Tbe species called by Kner (Novara Fische, 
198) >S'. ruhropunctatns seems to be different from this. 

87. Dactyloscopus sp. iiov. 

f ? Dacti/lagjius miindiis Gill, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Pliila., 1862, 505, 506. 

A specimen in the present collection, taken by Captain Dow on the 
coast of Central America, agrees well with the type of Dactylagnus mun- 
dus. It has, however, tlie dorsal beginning at the nape, and the psendo- 
branchife wanting. It is, therefore, a typical Dacfi/Joscopus, and i^roba- 
bly represents a species hitherto undescribed, but without further infor- 
mation we are not prepared to describe it as new, as it may be really 
identical with Dactylagnus mundus. 

Color in spirits, light olivaceous, the edgings of the scales, some ver- 
miculations on top of head, and the labial fringes, clear brown. Fins 
translucent; the caudal with a brown bar at base. Eyes dark. 

Head 4^ in length ; depth 6f . D. VI-38 ; A. II, 37. Y. 3. Scales 
G-5I-0. B. G. L. 3i inches.

iusertiou of anal flu, theuce taperiug to a very narrow tail. Head 
narrow, cuboid, compressed, the upper surface nearly plane, the cheeks 
vertical. Eyes very small, superior, with little lateral range; diameter 
of orbit about ^ length of head ; snout very short, about equaling 
orbit. Anterior nostril in a short tube. Gape subvertical, the lower 
jaw very heavy, projecting, as in Uranoscopus ; premaxillaries pro- 
tractile, the processes reaching far behind orbits; lips fringed; both 
jaws with bands of villiform teeth; no teeth on tongue, vomer, or pala- 
tines. 

Subopercle and interopercle very wide, flexible, striate, the latter 
overlapping throat and base of ventral fins, the former wholly covering 
base of pectoral fins; the striations of opercle terminate posteriorly in 
a wide, coarse, membranaceous fringe. Branchiostegal membranes not 
united, free from the isthmus. Pubic bones forming a sharp projection 
at throat. No pseudobranchite. Gills small, a round pore behind the 
fourth. 

Dorsal beginning on the nape, its distance from snout about equaling 
depth of body. The first six rays are shorter than those following and 
not connected by membrane; as no traces of articulation can be found, 
they are probably flexible spines, but are not clearly diflerentiated from 
those immediately following. Origin of anal under fourth dorsal spine. 
Caudal distinct, narrow, short. Ventrals inserted under anterior 
margin of preopercle. Ventrals 2 in head; pectorals 1^. 

Scales large, with entire edges, wanting on head, breast, and region 
behind pectoral fins. Lateral line beginning at upper posterior angle 
of opercle, running parallel with the back on about 12 scales, then 
obliquely downwards to middle of body.

Head 6f to 7^ ; eye U- to 5 in head. Teeth in upper jaw small, acute, 
in a rather narrow band ; sometimes a few in the front of the jaw incon- 
spicuously enlarged ; those in lower jaw and on palatines conic, blunt, 
in somewhat wider bands, the outer series of lower jaw enlarged, canine- 
like ; vomer with a narrowly oblong patch of small, blunt teeth, sur- 
rounding a median series of 3 to G conspicuously enlarged, retrorsely 
curved canines, which are usually much the largest teeth in the mouth. 

The original types of this species belonged to the present collection, 
having been sent by Professor Verrill to the Museum of Comparative 
Zoology. They are said to have been taken alive from the shells of 
pearl oysters. Our Fierasfer arenicola, from Mazatlan, is apparently 
not specifically difierent. 

The generic name Carapus Eafinesque, has been lately substituted 
for Fierasfer by Professor Poey, following a suggestion of Dr. Gill 
(Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila., 18G4, 152). This change does not seem to 
us justifiable, as it certainly is most undesirable. 



630 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The following is tlie original diagnosis of Cnrapus (Raf., Indice d'lttiol. 
Siciliana, 1810,57): 

"XII. Gen. Carapus. Kessnn' ala dorsale, ne caudale, un' ale anale, e 
due ale pettorali, mascella superiore piii luuga dell' iuferiore, coda nuda 
al disotto. Osserv. Dift'erisce dal vero genere Gymnotus, che ba 1' ala 
anale lunghissima, ricuoprendo 11 disotto della coda, e la mascella iu- 
feriore pill lunga della superiore." 

IS'o species is here mentioned, but in the list of Sicilian fisbes, on page 
37, we find : 

"272. Carapus acus. Raf., App. gen. 12 (Gymnotus acus Linn.) Ca- 
rapo aguglia. Anciduzza." 

We find tbat tbese two genera correspond to tbe first and second sub- 
genera recognized under Gymnotiis by La Cepede, the first (" Gymnotus'''') 
\VLQ\\i(\.mg electricus, putaol {fasciatus), and alhus; the second (" Carapus''^) 
including carapo^ Jierasfer {=acus L.), and longiro stratus. Tbe name Ca- 
rapus is evidently suggested by " Carapo^^'' and the generic diagnosis 
of Rafinesque above quoted seems to be entirely extracted from Gmelin's 
il(i'iiQ.T:{\)i\o\\ oi Gymiiotus carapo ['■^ Gymnotus * * * dorso apterygio, 
pinna ani longitudine, * * * maxilla superiore lougiore * * * 
ani piuuiie in caudie apicem non excurrens, sed ante caudse pinnam 
desinens"). The diagnosis does not apply to the species ofFierasfer, 
wliich have a distinct dorsal fin. It seems, therefore, proper to consider 
Gymnotus carapo L. the type of Carapus Raf., while G. electricus L. is 
evidently the type of Rafinesque's Gymnotus. 

In the tenth edition of the Systema Nature, but two species are 
referred to Gymnotiis, G. carapo and G. asiaticus, the latter not being 
a member of this group. If we date our nomenclature from this tenth 
edition, G. carapo L. must be taken as the type of Gymnotus, Carapus 
Raf. being a synonym of Gymnotus, while the name Electrophorus Gill 
should be used instead of Gymnotus for Gymnotus electricus L. (ed. xii). 

89. Citharichthys spilopterus Giiutlier. 

90. Antennarius sanguineus Gill. 

91. Antennarius strigatus Gill. 

An adult example, 10 inches long, agrees in but few respects with 
the descriptions drawn, by Gill and Giinther {Antennarius tenuifilis), 
from immature examples. 

First dorsal spine elongate, filiform, twice the length of the second, 
with very slender dermal tip. Third spine more robust than second, 
wholly concealed in the skin, its length equal to that of first spine. 
Lips, maxillary, and a large transverse area behind second dorsal sjnne 
naked, each side of this area with a few sjiinous tubercles. Skin else- 
where covered with fine shagreen-like armature.

mouth finely mottled with light olive brown ; many irregular blackish 
areas on head and body, those on lower side of head showing a tendency 
to form concentric bars ; some on sides forming irregular bars down- 
wards from back ; posterior portion of body not darker than the anterior 5 
terminal parts of all the fins largely blackish, but with distinct black 
bars ; some scattered round blackish blotches on sides, each consisting 
of a number of smaller black spots on an olive ground. Head and 
body with numerous pinkish and rose-red spots and bars, the latter sinu- 
ous, irregular, with wavy margins ; a pinkish bar behind maxillary ; a 
broad, saddle-like pinkish blotch across interval between second and 
third dorsal spines; a third bar from in front of origin of second dorsal 
downwards towards base of pectorals ; a fourth across top of caudal 
peduncle. First dorsal spine narrowly barred with brown. 

92. Balistes capistratus Shaw. 

(Shaw Genl. Zool. V, pt. 2, 417, 1804 (based on Balistebride'La C6iwde = Balistes 
mitis Beniiett= Balistes f7-enatus Eichardson.) 

93. Balistes polylepis Steind. 

94. Tetrodon angusticeps Jenyns. 

(Canthogaster lohatus Steiud., Icbthyol. Not. X, 18.) 

This species is represented in the collection by two fine specimens 
from Panama, each about one foot long. They agree perfectly with Dr. 
Steindachner's Altata specimen (type of C. lobatus), but the nostrils are 
formed as in typical species of Tetrodon, i. e., tubular, with two lateral 
openings near the summit. 

Jenyns' description of T. angusticeps, from the Galapagos Islands, 
was evidently drawn from a specimen in poor condition. This would 
account for the alleged absence of prickles on the skin. In all other 
respects the description agrees with the specimens before us — the nar- 
row, channel -like interorbital sj^ace, the minute paijilliform protuber- 
ances on the skin, and the pair of fleshy flaps behind the nape being 
conspicuous features of the species. 

95. Tetrodon politiis Ayrea. 

96. Arothron erethizon, sp. nov. (29679). 

Body all, except snout and caudal peduncle, thickly beset with long, 
robust, quill-like spines, which are longest and most numerous on the 
belly ; these spines are concealed by the outer skin until the animal 
is inflated, in which case they j^rotrude ; under a microscope the skin is 
seen to be provided with innumerable minute protuberances, much as 
in Tetrodon angusticeps. 

Snout short, cuboid, its length 1^ times orbit; the upper profile slightly 
concave, interorbital space wide, slightly less than twice diameter of 
eye, strongly concave because of the elevated orbital ridges. Nostril 
tentacle bifid to the base, the divisions compressed, flap-like, without 
conspicuous openings; the inner surface of each division is thickly

covered with minute, cup-sbaped depressions, into which open the per- 
forations of the tube. Distance from tentacle to eye but twice length 
of tentacle, which equals one-fourth diameter of orbit. 

Caudal fin equal to length of caudal peduncle. Dorsal large, the base 
equaling three-sevenths height of fin. 

Body without fleshy slips or folds. 

Head 3^ in length; eye about one-fourth head. D. or 10; A. 10. 

Color in spirits : Dark brown above, white below ; entire upi^er parts 
including caudal fin, covered with round, white spots, most numerous 
on caudal peduncle, the largest much less than half pupil; a round black 
area surrounding base of pectorals, bounded by a white line; several 
parallel longitudinal black streaks below the pectorals ; orbit with two 
concentric white rings. 

Known from six specimens collected by Professor Bradley at Panama. 
The type is numbered 29079 on the register of the National Museum. 

The following species are here for the first time recorded from Panama: 

1. Ginglymostoma cirratum.

jriTMPIiVG SEEDS AND GAIiliS.* 

By CHARLES V. RII^EIT. 

Having recently received some fresh specimens of so-called "Mexican 
Jumping Seeds," or "Devil's Beans," as they are popularly called, I take 
occasion while yet they are active to exhibit them to the society. It 
will be noticed that these seeds are somewhat triangular, or of the shape 
of convolvulus seeds, there being two flat sides meeting at an obtuse 
angle, and a convex one, which has a median carina. They not only

roll from oue side to another, but actually move by jerks and jumps, 
and will, when very active, jump at least a liue from any object tliey 




Carpocapsa SALTiTANS : rt, larva; ft, pupa; c, imago — enlarged, bair-lines showing

may be resting on. The actual jumping power has been doubted by 
some writers, but I have often witnessed it. To the uninitiated these 
movements of a hard seed seem little less than miraculous. They are 
induced by a plump, whitish, lepidopterous larva which occupies about 
one-fifth of the interior, the occnpied seed being, in fact, but ahollow shell, 
with an inner lining of silk which the larva has spun. The larva looks 
very much like the common api)le-worm {Carpocapsa pomonella), and be- 
longs, in fact, to the same genus. It resembles it further in remaining for 
a long time in the full-grown larva state before transforming, so that the 
seeds will keep up their motion throughout most of the winter months. 
When about to transform, which is usually in the months of January 
and February, it cuts a neat, circular door in the convex side of its house, 
strengthens the same with silk, spins a loose tube of silk within the 
seed, and therein transforms to the pupa state. The moth soon after- 
ward pushes its way out from the little door prepared for it. 

The moth was first described in 1857 as Carpocapsa saltitans by Prof. 
J. O. Westwood,* and afterward as Carpocapsa dehaisiana by Mous. H. 
Lucas, t 

In regard to the plant on which these seeds occur there is much yet 
to learn, and I quote what Mr. G. W. Barnes, president of the San 
Diego Society of Natural History, wrote me in 1874 concerning it, in the 
hope that some of the botanists present may recognize it: 

"Arrow-weed {Yerba cleflecha). — This is the name the shrub bears 
that produces the triangular seeds that during six or eight months have 
a continual jumping movement. The shrub is small, from 4 to G feet in 
height, branchy, and in the months of June and July yields the seeds, 
a pod containing three to five seeds. These seeds have each a little 
worm inside. The leaf of the plant is very similar to that of the ga-

rambullo, the ouly difierence being in the size, this being a little larger. 
It is half an inch in length and a quarter of an inch in width, a little 
more or less. The bark of the shrub is ash-colored, and the leaf is per- 
fectly green during all the seasons. By merely stirring coffee, or any 
drink, with a small branch of it, it acts as an active cathartic. Taken 
in large doses it is an active poison, speedily causing death unless coun- 
teracted by an antidote." 

lu a recent letter he states that he is informed that the region of 
Mamos, in Sonora, is the only place where the plant grows ; that the 
tree is about four feet high and is a species of laurel, with the leaves of 
a dark varnished green. " It bears the seeds only once in two years. 
The tree is called Brincador (jumper), and the seeds are called Brinca- 
deros. The seeds are more quiet in fair weather, and lively on the ap- 
proach of a storm." 

Professor Westwood mentions the fact that the jjlant is known by 
the Mexicans as ^^ Colliguaja ;" and Prof. E. P. Cox, formerly State 
geologist of Indiana, now living on the Pacific coast, informs me that 
the shrub has a wood something like hazel or whahoo; that the leaf is 
like a broad and short willow leaf. He confirms the statement as to 
its poisonous character; that a stick of the shrub, when used by the 
natives to stir their "penola" (ground corn-meal, parched), purges, and 
that the shrub is used to poison arrowheads. The plant is undoubtedly 
Euphorbiaceous. * 

The peculiarity about this insect is that it is the only one of its order, 
so far as we know, which possesses this habit, and it is not easy to con- 
ceive of what benefit this habit can be other than the possible pro- 
tection aftbrded by working the seed, after it falls to the ground, into 
sheltered situations. 

The true explanation of the movements of the larva by which the 
seed is made to jump was first given by me in the Transactions of the 
Saint Louis Academy of Science for December 6, 1875 (Vol. Ill, p. 
cxci). 

The jumping power exhibited in this " seed" is, however, trifling com, 
pared with that possessed in a little gall which I also exhibit. This 
gall, about the size of a mustard seed, and looking very much like a 
miniature acorn, is found in large numbers on the under side of the 
leaves of various oaks of the White Oak group, and has been reported 
from Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, and California. It falls from a cavity on 
the under side of the leaves, very much as an acorn falls from its cup, 
and is sometimes so abundant that the ground beneath an infested tree 
is literally covered. It is produced by a little black Cynips, which 
was described as Cynips saltatorius by Mr. Henry Edwards. The 
bounding motion is doubtless caused by the larva which lies curved 
within the gall, and very much on the same principle that the common 
cheese-skii)per {FiopMla casei) is known to spring or skip. Dr. W. 
H. Mussey, of Cincinnati, in a communication to the Natural History 
Society of that city, December, 1875, states, in fact, that such is the 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 635 

case ; though members of the California Academy who have written 
on the subject assert that the motion is made by the pupa, which I 
think very improbable. At all events the bounding motion is great, 
as the little gall may be thrown 2 or 3 inches from the earth ; and 
there are few things more curious than to witness, as I have done, 
a large number of these tiny galls in constant motion under a tree. 
They cause a noise upon the fallen leaves that may be likened to the 
pattering of rain. 



WOTE ON CliUSTER FL.IES. 

By W. H. DALI.. 

Having heard several years ago of a fly which was a great nuisance 
in the country houses near Geneva, N. Y., among members of my wife's 
family living there, I requested information and specimens when it 
should be convenient. Some time since a relative visited Geneva, and 
on his return brought me some of these flies alive in a bottle covered 
with gauze, which were exhibited at the last meeting of the Biological 
Society and turned over to Prof. C. V. Eiley for identification. Since 
then a letter has been received, from which I make the following extracts : 

"It is probably thirty years since the flies appeared in our neighbor- 
hood. I remember little about it except that they were at once a terror 
to all neat housekeepers, and from their peculiar habits a constant sur- 
prise. People soon learned to lo«k for them everywhere; in beds, in 
pillow slips, nuder table covers, behind pictures, in wardrobes nestled 
in bonnets and hats, under the edge of carpets, and in all i)ossible and 
impossible places. A window casing st»lidly nailed on will, when re- 
moved, show a solid line of them from top to bottom; they are uncanny. 
They like new houses, but are often found swarming in old unused 
buildings and go regularly to church, or perhaps ouly a few good ones 
abide in sanctuaries ; any way they are there. Best of all tbey like a 
clean dark chamber seldom used, and if not disturbed form in large 
clusters about the ceilings. With tliem are usually found a number of 
purplish black hornets and some ladybugs ( Coccinella). They are very 
cold and feel in the hand like small bits of ice. They are very oily; if 
crushed, leave on the floor a great grease-spot. I hardly think they 
breed in the houses, but do not know. About the 1st of April or as 
soon as the sun shines warm in the early spring they come out in the 
grass and fly up to the sunny side of the houses. Some possibly creep 
in open windows, or if the house is closed and sealed they have a faculty 
of going through any crack. They remain until some time in May, 
then disappear, and no more are seen until about September, when they 
come and remain as long as they are allowed to. They are very strong. 
A powder that suffocates common house flies has very little effect on 
them, and we attack them with ammonia and drown them with boiling 
water; even then are not sure they are 'kilt entirely.' Very few are 
found in the towns or villages ; they live in country places altogether. 



G36 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Words fail to des<;ribe their geueral depravity ; it is beyoud expression. 
If you wish to be happy, be sure you dou't introduce cluster flies into 
your fiimily." 

The flies are also stated to be very sluggish — crawl rather thau fly 
away when disturbed ; hang from the cornice of a room in large clusters, 
like swarming bees, which can be brushed bodily into a vessel of boiling 
water; under buildings between earth and floor they are often found in 
incredible numbers ; crawl in quiet, dark rooms between the sheets and 
under the i)illows and vallances of made-up beds, and under the nailed- 
dov,-u edges of carpets, leaving nasty spots and a disagreeable smell 
wherever they go. If windows and blinds are opened and the room is 
occupied, they quietly vacate the premises in a little while unless they 
can crawl into some closet or wardrobe. There are in geueral appear- 
ance very like the common housefly, but heavier-bodied, somewhat 
larger and more hairy — in short, coarser-looking. 

Professor Riley writes as follows: 

''So far as I have been able to investigate the matter your fly is the 
Musca famiUaris of Harris (Ent. Corresp., p. 33G), synonymous, without 
much question, with the Musca r?^(7/s Fabricius. It is not uncommon in 
New England in houses, nearly disappeariug when M.domesticn most pre- 
vails and found most in spring and fall. But I find no account of its 
abundance and annoyance in the manner you describe. It belongs to 
the genus PoUenia Eobineau-Desvoidy." 

"CLUSTER FLIES." 

The fly presented by Mr. Dall at a previous meeting is the Musca 
rudis of Fabricius, a species known to be common to Europe and Amer- 
ica* and redescribed, as Musca famiUaris, in this country by Harris,t 
who says of it: "This species, not uncommon in houses in summer, 
nearly disappears the more abundant M. harpyia prevails. It resem- 
bles M. rudis Fabr., but is larger than the only specimen I have seen, 
and has the thorax much more densely clothed with fulvous hairs. 
From M. harpyia [M. domestica C. V. E.] it diflers in the superior size, 
in having the eyes coutiguoifs in the male, in the prominence of the 
front, in the hairiness of the thorax, etc. 21. obscura of Fabricius is 
also synonymous, according to Meizers, who says of it (vol. V, p. OG) 
" Ein altes verwischtes Exemplar von 21. rudis.''^ It belongs to the genus 
PoUenia of Eobineau Desvoidy, who made it, in fact, the type of that 
genus. This author in his " Histoire des Dipteres des Environs de 
Paris," (vol. II, p. GOO), mentions about 40 species of PoUenia, and says 
of rudis: "It becomes very common in autumn, and the first frosts 
compel it to take possession of our apartments. It here accumulates 
in numbers in the embrasures of windows and in the recesses of walls; 

*Cf. Loew's note on this subject in liis Ueber die Dipterenfauna des Bernstein's

it thou seems almost deprived of motiou." He acliiiowledges tliat liis 
P. autnmnalis is also a synonym of rndis. 

It will be seen from these facts that the species is not easily identified. 
This is accounted for on several grounds : 1st, the flies when they have 
frequented pollen-bearing flowers present a much brighter, yellowish 
appearance; 2d, the tufts of hairs which characterize it are very easily 
rubbed off; 3d, most of the insects of the family, as well as other Dip- 
tera of allied families, have a great tendency to grease, i. e., they soon 
acquire in the cabinet a greasy, dark-colored aspect in which the char- 
acteristic markings are obliterated. 

The genus, w^hich is numerous in species and individuals, is chiefly 
distinguished by the bulging middle face ; by the base of the antennae 
being generally fulvous in color, and by the tufts of hairs at the sides 
of the thorax, to which last character the generic name alludes. The 
old genus Musca has been subdivided into numerous genera founded, 
as in this instance, on rather trifling characters, so that it becomes very 
difficult to separate some of them or to properly refer the species to 
them. 

There are two authentic specimens of Follenia rudis, determined by 
Baron Osten Sacken in my cabinet now in the National Museum, so that 
there can be no question as to the species. 

In reference to the habits of the species it will be seen that v.^hat I 
liave quoted from other authors corresponds very well with the facts 
as communicated by Mr. Dall, though I find no mention of any such 
unusual swarming in houses and working under bed clothing as com- 
municated by his correspondent. The species is not infrequent in the 
fall of the year in houses in Washington and is readily distinguished 
from the common house-fly, even by an ordinary observer, by its larger 
size and more sluggish movements. The specimens submitted by Dr. 
Baker and received from Maine are specifically identical. Dr. S. W. 
Wilhston, of New Haven, Conn., writes me that he thinks he observed 
it in numbers clumsily crawling on the snow during mild weather in 
February and March. 

Nothing definite is recorded of the larval habits and development of 
the species, though, speaking of the genus, Eobineau-Desvoidy remarks 
that the eggs are laid in manure and in decomposing animal and veg- 
etable matter. The larva doubtless lives in such decomposing sub- 
stances. 

It is not improbable that in parts of New York the species may have 
acquired more troublesome habits than it has elsewhere, for among the 
Diptera we have such instances of peculiar and injurious habits being 
locally developed, as in Trypeta pomoneUa Walsh, which in the West 
confines its work to the wild crabs and haws, while in the Eastern States 
it proves injurious to cultivated apples. LiiclUa macellariais a grievous 
pest in the Southwest, producing the well-known screw-worm so inju- 
rious to stock, whereas in the more northern States we never hear of 
such injury.

A BEVIETT OF THE GENUS NOTIJRIJS, WITH A DESCRIPTION OF 

ONE NEW SPECIES. 

BY JOSEPH SIXAIN AND OEOROE B. KALB. 

The present paper contains the synonymy and diagnostic characters 
of the species of the genus Noturus Eaflnesque, with short descriptions 
of those species in the accounts of which we have found confusion. 

The material on which this pax^er is based is partly the same which 
served for Professor Jordan's account of the genus (Bull. U. S. Nat. 
Mus. X, i)p. 9G to 103, 1877), with the addition of numerous specimens 
since received by him from different parts of the United States. Among 
these we find a single species which appears to be new to science. 

We desire to express our indebtedness to Professor Jordan for the 
use of his collections and library, and for valuable suggestions.

2. Noturus elassochir, sj). nov. 

Eahitat— Illinois Eiver. 

Head, 4; depth, 5f ; width of head, 5. D. I, G; A. 16. 

Body robust, somewhat elevated in the dorsal region. Head moder- 
ate. Month large ; its width 1| in head. Interorbital space about equal 
to the length of snout, which is 3 in head. Jaws subequal. Maxillary 
barbel rather short, 2^ in head. Dorsal spine rather weak, but nearly 
as long as the very short pectoral spine, which is 3^ in head. The ser- 
ration is very similar to that of insignis, but much less distinct in front. 
Humeral process obscure. Adipose fin long, low, with emargiuatiou 
well defined ; caudal and anal fins large. 



640 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Color, ill spirits, dark brown; vertical fins edged with darker; lat- 
eral line dark. 

This species seems to be distinguished from insignis chiefly by the 
much shorter spines, by a slight difl'erence in coloration, and by the 
more robust body. This species is described from a single specimen, 
4f inches long, taken at Napierville, Ills., by Dr. Ernest E. Copelaud. 
The type (No. 29G77, U. S. Nat. Mus.) has been i^resented by Professor 
Jordan to the United States National Museum.

River); Jordan, Man. Vert.. 336, 1878 (French Broad River). 

EaUtat. — French Broad Eiver, Tennessee. 

Head, 33 ; depth, 5^ 5 width of head, U. D. I, 7 ; A. 11. 

Body rather robust, not elevated in the dorsal region. Mouth moder- 
ate, upper jaw much projecting. Interorbital space slightly convex, 3 
in head. Maxillary barbel reaches about to gill-openings. Dorsal spine 
25 in head ; pectoral spine 14 iu head, with six large recurved teeth on 
inner edge, whose length is about equal to the diameter of the spine; 
outer edge obscurely serrated. Humeral process indistinct. Adipose 
fin low, distinctly separated from the caudal. Anal short and elevated. 

Color, in spirits, brownish, dark above, becoming lighter behind and 
below; everywhere punctulate, except on belly. 

This species is here described from the original type (No. 29G78, U. S. 
Nat. Mus.), 31 inches long. It was taken alive in the mouth of a water 
snalie, by Professors Jordan and Gilbert, in the Big Pigeon Eiver, a trib- 
utary of the French Broad, at Clifton, Tenn. It is the only representa- 
tive of the species known, and may be an abnormal specimen of N. 
miurus. The specimens from Tar Eiver, North Carolina, afterwards re- 
ferred to this species by Professor Jordan, are large examples of N. 
miurus.

By DAVID S. J©ltI>AN AND CHAKLJES H, GII.ISEKT. 



1. Myrophis vafer si), nov. (29681.) 

{Myrophis pmictatus Giinther VIII, 1870, 50. Jor. &. Gilb., Bull. U. S. Fish 
Comm., 1882, 109: uaineonly; not of Liitken.) 

Body subterete anteriorly, compressed posteriorly, more robust and 
less vermiform than in Myrophis lumhricus; tail strongly compressed. 
Head comparatively large, its width posteriorly being greater than that 
of the body. Upper jaw considerably projecting; both jaws rather 
blunt. Eye moderate, considerably nearer angle of mouth than tip of 
snout, its diameter rather less than half snout. Gape rather long, about 
3^ in head. Head constricted behind the cheeks. 

Teeth small, sharp, slender, hooked backward, apparently in one or 
two irregular series in each jaw, and a single long series, somewhat 
broken anteriorly, on the vomer. 

Anterior nostrils with small tubes, posterior nostrils without tubes. 
Gill-openings moderate, oblique, placed in front of and below the bases 
of the pectorals, which are rather broader than the gill-openings. 

Pectoral fins small, acute at tip, their length a little more than that 
of snout, and one-fifth to one-sixth that of head. Dorsal fin of moderate 
height posteriorly, its origin somewhat nearer gill-opening than vent, 
its distance from gill opening a little more than length of head. 

Head 8^ in total length. Greatest depth of body about 28. Length 
of head and trunk 2^ in total. Head 2^ in trunk. 

Color in life, light olivaceous ; silvery on breast and belly ; back and 
sides thickly dotted with fine, olive-brown specks. Snout somewhat 
dusky. 

This species is very common in the rock-pools at Panama, where 
numerous examples (the types numbered 29G81 U. S. Nat. Mus. register) 
were obtained by Mr. Gilbert, the largest 7^ inches in length. 

This species has been already noticed under the name of Myrophis

punctains. There is, liovrever, no positive evidence that it is identical 
with the African species, so named by Professor Liitkeu. The Texan 
species oi MijropMs {lumbricus J. & G.) and the Cuban species {micros- 
tigmius Poey) seem to be distinct from it. 

Chloroscombrus orqueta sp. uov. (29165, 29278, 29285, 29343.) 
Mieropttryx chrysurus Steiud., Ichth. Beit. Ill, 61. 
ChJoroscomhrus chrysurus Jor. & Gilb.,Bull. U. S. Fish. Comm. 1882, 110. 

Proportions, fin rays, and coloration essentially as in G. chrysurus, 
which species it represents in the Pacific. From the Atlantic form, 
C. orqueta differs constantly in the much longer curve of the lateral line, 
and in the distinct armature along caudal peduncle. 

Body ovate, strongly compressed, the edges trenchant. Dorsal and 
ventral outlines very regularly curved, the curve of the belly consider- 
ably stronger than that of the back, the axis of body much nearer the 
latter. Caudal peduncle very slender. Young less elongate than the 
adult, otherwise very similar in form. 

Head small, rather pointed, the anterior profile nearly straight. Mouth 
small, very oblique, the lower jaw projecting. Maxillary broad, extend- 
ing a little beyond front of eye, its length 2f in head, its tipe marginate; 
supplemental bone well developed. Teeth very small, those of the jaws 
not villiform, forming very narrow bands or single series in both jaws; 
villiform patches on vomer, palatines, and tongue. Adipose eyelid well 
developed. Preorbital veiy narrow, not half width of orbit. Gill-rakers 
numerous, very long, slender, close set. 

Head nearly naked. Body covered with well-developed imbricated 
scales; the ventral ridge, and a narrowly triangular area forwards from 
front of dorsal naked. 

Lateral line with a rather strong arch anteriorly, the chord of the 
curve being considerably longer than head, and 1^ to If in the straight 
part. (In C. chrysurus the chord of the curve is about as long as head 
from tip of lower jaw, and If to If in the straight portion.) A distinct 
keel along caudal peduncle, the scales of lateral line enlarged and bony 
with bluntish tips. (In C. chrysurus the scales of lateral line are little 
if at all different from the other scales.) Dorsal and anal naked, the 
sheaths at their bases largely developed along the anterior half of each 
fin. 

Antrorse dorsal spine concealed. Spinous dorsal persistent, the spines 
slender, the longest slightly shorter than anterior rays of soft dorsal, 
which are about half head. Soft dorsal and anal with anterior rays 
highest, the fins not falcate. Caudal widely forked, the upper lobe 
slightly longer than the lower, which about equals head. Anal spines 
strong. Pectorals very long, falcate, a little more than one-third length. 
Ventrals short, about two-fifths head. 

Color somewhat darker than in C. chrysurus. In life, back green 
with blue reflections; sides and below silvery- white with bluisli and

purplish reflections; a distinct black blotch on upper angle of operclo, 
extending on shoulder girdle; inside of opercle, and skin lining shoulder 
girdle below, largely dusky. A quadrate black blotch on back of tail, 
extending backwards along bases of upper caudal rays. Fins light 
yellowish, the dorsal and anal edged with black; tip of upper caudal 
lobe black. Ventrals whitish. Tongue, base and roof of mouth, and 
skin of upper branchiostegals black. 

Abundant at Panama; recorded by Dr. Steindachner from Magdalena 
Bay, Lower California. The types, numbered 291G5, 29278, 29285, and 
29343, were collected by Mr. Gilbert at Panama. It is known to the 
fishermen at Panama as Orqueta.

ON THE JVOiTIE!VCt.ATUKE OF THE GENUS OPHICHTHVS. 
BY DAVID S. JORDAN AND CHARLES H. GILBERT. 

The generic name " Ophichthys Ahl" has been adopted by Dr. Giinther 
for a large group of eels, including numerous nominal " genera " of earlier 
writers. Whether this vast group will admit of further generic sub- 
division, we do not here propose to discuss. It is, in any event, divis- 
ible into subgenera, and for these subordinate grou^is we should adopt 
names in accordance with accepted rules of nomenclature. It becomes, 
tberefore, important to ascertain what species should be taken as the 
type of Ophichthys. 

As the original memoir of Ahl is not, as far as we know, in any Ameri- 
can library, we have written to Dr. Liitken, of the University of Copen- 
hagen, in regard to it. His answer to this letter is the source of the 
information given below in regard to the memoir in question. The fol- 
lowing is the title:

The genus Murccna is in this paper divided into two, as follows : 
JTurwna. Ophichthus.

The species enumerated are:

1. M. Jielena L. 1. 0. opMs (L.) 

2. M. nebulosa. 2. 0. serpens (L.)

4. M. annulata. 4. 0. myrus (L.) 

5. M.fasciata. 5. 0. conger {Jj.) 

6. 0. anguilla (L.) 

The first species mentioued under OphichtJms is noticed as follows: 
" 0. oj)his : Cauda apterygia, corpore tereti, maculato. Hab. in 
Europeo niari et Indico. 

"Synonym: Munena ophis Linn. S. N. p. 425.

"Houttyu Natnral Hist. 1. D. p. 87. 
"Blocli, p. II, p. 35, t. 154." 

As to the authorship of this paper, Dr. Liitten observes : " It is ques- 
tionable whether the dissertation should be ascribed to the ^ Pmesid.', 
Thunberg or to Ahl ; you will see that the contemporaneous Vahl si^aks 
of it as being of Thunberg, without phrase, aod it is ascribed to Thun- 
berg also by Engelmanu. Until a late time, in the Swedish universities, 
the dissertations were written by the professor and only ' defended' 
by the students whose name they bear. Thus often you will find that 
a page by Eetzius or Linuieus was distributed to ten or twenty students, 
a sheet to each, for being defended, bearing these different names on 
their titles, but being afterwards collected and put together under 
the name of the real author. In other instances they were written by 
the student, when he was able to do it, and it is only to be seen from 
the paper itself whether it belongs to the student or to the master. In 
this special case it appears from the proemium that Ahl reallj- pretends 
to be the author, although probably he was not." 

This appears to be the earliest attempt at subdivision of the genus 
Murwna, the name OpMclithus being intended for all eels with pectoral 
fins. For some group of these eels it must, of course, be retained. 

In the diagnosis of the first three species the phrase " Cauda apt ery- 
gia" occurs, and it is to eels thus characterized, that the name (more 
correctly spelled Ophiclitliys) is restricted by Dr. Giinther. One of ihe 
three species, ojihis, serpens and cinereus^ must then be taken as its type. 
Two writers, Bleeker and Poey, have attempted further to restrict the 
genus Ophichthys. By a misapprehension, unfortunate, but easily ex- 
l)lained, Poey has considered Munena annulata as the type of Ophich- 
thys. As we have seen, this species is explicitly excluded by Ahl, and 

*This restriction of the Liuntean genus Munena to M. helena and its supposed con- 
geners must, of course, take precedence over the restriction made by Blocli & Schnei- 
der in 1801, wherein J/, anguilla was retained as the typo of Muroena, and M. helena 
referred to a new genus, Gymnothorax. 



G50 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

the name OpJiichthys caimot be used for the group {Phodoniophis Kanp) 
to vrhich it belongs. It seems to us proper, Avith Bleeker, to cousitler 
Murccna ophis as the type of Ophichthys. It is the first species men- 
tioned by Ahl, and for that reason it has already been taken by Bleeker 
as the type. It is also the species which suggested the generic name. 

It is, however, not evident what this Linnoian ophis may be. It is 
based on a species of Artedi, which in turn rests on descrijitions of 
Willoughby and Eay. To Ahl it was apparently known chiefly from 
the figure and description of Bloch. In any event, all the evidence 
points to a species allied to Ophklithys triserialis, ocellatus, and the like, 
and for this group we would retain the name Opliichthys. It would then 
be nearly equivalent to the genus O.ryodontichtliys of Poey, and would 
l>rol)ably, even if viewed as a subgenus only, include the following- 
nominal genera: Murcvnopsis Le Sueur; Centrtiropliis, Fwcilocephalus, 
MicrodonopMs, CcecilopMs, Rerp>etoichthyfi, ElapsojJsis, ScytalopMs^ and 
Leptorhinophis of Kaup, and most likely several others of the same 
author. 

The genus OpMsiirus of La C6pede was originally based on two spe- 
cies, 0. ophis La C. (not of L.) and 0. serpens L. The first restriction 
of the name seems to be that of Swainson, in 1839, who removes 0. scr- 
pens as the type of Leptognathus Sw., leaving the name Ophisurus for 
0. ophis La C. and its allies. Later (185G) Dr. Kauj) gave to the latter 
group the name of Fisoodonophis^ and made 0. serpens the type of 
Ophisurus. The earlier restriction must take precedence and the name 
Ophisurus (or Ophiurus) must be retained for the species with granular 
teeth, if they be separated from Ophichthys proper. Whether these 
species again admit of subdivision, as suggested by Poey, does not 
now concern us, as the American species are typical Ophisuri. 

The genus Ccccula Yahl has been adopted (Syn. fish K. A. 358) by the 
present writers, instead of Sphagehranchus Bloch. This name Ccecula 
occurs in a memoir (for a copy of which we are indebted to the kindness 
of Dr. Liitken) in the " Skrivter af :N\aturhistorie-Selskabet" 3d Bind. 2d 
Hefte. 1794, pp. 149-15G, entitled "Beskrivelse af en nye Fiske-Slaigt, 
Ca'cula, af M. Vahl." 

In this memoir, reference is made to Thunberg's separation of Murccna 
L., into Murama and Ophichthys, and the generic name Cacvla is pro- 
posed for two species. The one is described in full and figured under 
the name of Ccvcula pterygera. The other is the Linna?,au Murccna cccca, 
a species unknown to Vahl, which he renames Cwcula apterygia. The 
genus Ccvcula is thus characterized : 

" Corpus teretiusculum, alepidotum, Branchiarum apertura collaris, 
linearis, PinuiB ventrales «& caudales null^. Oculi minutissimi." 

The species are especially distinguished ix& pterygera, "pinna dorsali 
analique," and apterygia., " l^innis nuUis." 

This Ccvcula pterygera is the only species of the genus known to Yahl 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 651 

from autopsy, and also the one placed first by liim in his genus. It has 
been already (Syn. Fish. I^. A. 358) considered by us the type of the 
genus Cwcula, and this restriction should stand. It is not quite certain 
what species Vahl had, and his type is not now to be found in the 
museum of Copenhagen. It is thought by Giinther that C. pterygera is 
identical with SphaffehrancJius polyophtlialmus (Bleeker) Kaup. Spliage- 
hranchus rostratus Bloch, the type of iSphagehranchus Bloch (1795) is also 
uncertain. It is, however, evident that the two species are closely re- 
lated, and that both belong to Giinther's subgenus Sphagehranchus 
"group A." Ccccula must therefore take the place of Sphagebranclms, 
of the still later Dalophis Eafinesque, and of Lamnostoma and An- 
guisurus Kaup. The two species of Ccccula described from the United 
States coast are not genuine members of that group, as they have the 
dorsal large, beginning in front of middle of head, and the gill-open- 
ings vertical and lateral, not oblique and ventral as in Cwcula. The 
genus Calleclielys Kaup apjiarently coincides with this type, and may 
be accepted as a generic or subgeneric name for them. 

The species of " Ophichthys" Giinther known from American waters, 
north of the Tropic of Cancer, may be grouped as follows : 
a. No trace of fins anywhere. 

1. Apferichthys selacliops Jor. & Gilb. 

h. A high dorsal and no other fins. 

2. Letharchus velifer Goode & Bean. 

c. Dorsal beginning on front of head ; pectorals obsolete or nearly 
so; teeth small; pointed. 

3. Calleclielys scuticaris (Goode & Bean). 

4. Calleclielys teres (Goode & Beau). 

d. Pectorals developed, usually small ; teeth granular. 

5. OpMsurus acuminatus Gronow. { = longusFoGy.) 

6. OpMsurus xysturus Jor. & Gilb, 

e. Pectorals large; teeth all pointed. 
/. Teeth of each series subequal. 

7. Ophichthys miurus Jor. «& Gilb. 

8. Ophichthys triseriaUs (Kaup). 

9. Ophichthys ocellatus (Le Sueur). 

10. Ophichthys macrurus Poey. 

11. Ophichthys chrysops Poey.

OIV the: I>IFE COIiORATIOIV OF THE YOUIVG OF POMACEIVTKU8 
RUBICUIVDIJS. 

By ROSA SMITH. 

Hitherto only the adult form of this species has been known, and its 
uniform deep scarlet coloration has been considered to form a marked 
contrast to the coloration of the other species of Pomacentrus. I have 
lately secured numerous young specimens, and find their coloration quite 
different from that of the adult, and in general similar to that of the 
other members of this genus. 

The ground color is dusky scarlet, with numerous markings of an in- 
tensely bright blue, which occasionally changes to bluish green. Two 
series of elongate spots form a blue stripe on either side of the median 
line, between tip of snout and beginning of dorsal fin; a line of blue 
on superior margin of iris is followed jiosteriorly by an irregular 
series of blue spots above the lateral line (the individual spots not 
quite equaling diameter of iris); the last of these spots is larger than 
those which precede it, being two-thirds of the orbital diameter, and 
extends up on the base of the dorsal fin at the posterior third of the 
spinous portion ; thence very small blue dots continue to the end of the 
dorsal fin, describing a curve which exactly outlines the extent to which 
scales cover the base of the articulate dorsal rays; a conspicuous blue 
spot or bar crosses top of caudal peduncle close to posterior insertion 
of dorsal fin. One or more small blue spots at base of caudal. The 
spine and first ray of ventral blue ; spines and tips of anterior rays of 
anal blue; a nearly round blue spot on posterior part of anal near its 
base. Sides of body more or less dotted with blue, as are also the 
cheeks and opercles. Pectorals and caudal semi-transparent, plain red- 
dish. Ground color of anal bright red. Dorsal fin dusky, with minute 
blue dots anterior to the markings mentioned. Abdomen and under sur- 
face of head lighter, immaculate. 

This description is made from specimens 1| to 2 inches in length. 
Specimens less than 1 inch long have the spinous dorsal almost wholly 
blue and all the markings larger, while an individual 3h inches long 
shows the markings similarly placed but relatively smaller, and tbe 
ground color is more olivaceous. 

The fin-rays are proportionately higher and the eye relatively larger 
than in the adult. The suborbital and jireopercle are without serra- 
tions. The small opercular spine, unlike that of the mature form, is 
smooth and wholly without denticulations. The greatest depth of the 
body is about half the length.

These brilliant little fishes inhabit onlj- large, deep rock pools, hiding 
under the sea-weed of ledges, and frequently swimming out into the 
open water of the pool. They are accompanied by the adult, the usual 
uniform scarlet color of which appears a distinct lusterless yellow in 
the water. 

The specimens described were taken at La Jolla, near San Diego. 
They have been sent to the United States National Museum.

oiv A ciivivArnoiv beak from penivsyi-taivia. 

By FREDERICK ^V. TRUE. 
(Read before the Biological Society of Washiugton, October 27, 1882.) 

1. In April of the present year Professor Baird received notice through 
the kindness of Mr. George Thurber, of New York, that a bear of pe- 
culiar color, which was said to have been killed in Pennsylvania, was 
exposed for sale at the commission house of Messrs. E. & O. Ward. 

Professor Baird immediately effected the purchase of the animal, and 
in due time it arrived at the National Museum. It proved to be a very 
beautiful specimen of the Cinnamon Bear ( Ursus americnnus Pallas, cin- 
namoneus And. & Bachra.), a male about two-thirds grown. 

The particulars of the capture being desired, the Messrs. Ward ad- 
dressed a letter to the hunter, Mr. Seely Bovier, and received a reply, 
of which the following is an extract : 

"Alba, Pa., Ajnil 20, 1882. 
"E. & O. Ward: 

"Gentlejien: Yours of 18th just received. I would say that the 
bear was killed by myself on April 12, in Lycoming County, Monet 
Township, in this State, on what is known as the South Mountain ranges. 
I have hunted and trapped all my life and have never seen anything li!ce 
this animal. All who have seen him are in doubt as to what species of 
bear he is. During all last summer in the back settlement near which 
I killed him, several of the men, women, and children were followed 
after night by what they called a panther. He would come very close 
and make an awful noise ; sometimes he would be seen about dark in 
the buck field. I told the men there were no panthers in the county; 
that it must be something else. Undoubtedly it was this bear which 
followed them. I never saw him until the day I killed him. He was 
the most ferocious of all the bears I have ever killed. You will find 
that one ball went through his liver; that seemed only to increase his 
rage, however, and I was forced to put one into his brains. The spots 
on his head where the hair is off evidence the violence with whicli he 
'tore around' after he was wounded. 



654 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

" Such are the facts about the bear. To any one wishing further par- 
ticulars about hiu) I will cheerfully give them. 

"Please have some one examine him very closely and tell me what 
species he is. 

"Yours respectfully, 

" SEELY BOVIER."

3. The hair, which is fine, is of two kinds, the longer straight, lustrous 
at the tips; the shorter crenulate, dull. The crenulate hair is absent on 
the feet and tip of tbe tail. It is also scarcely discernible on the an- 
terior part of the head. The straight hair everywhere except on the 
head and back of the ears is of a medium sable color, the outer third 
having a pure goldeu lustre. On the anterior part of the head and on 
the backs of the ears the color changes to buff. The darkest color is on 
the cheeks and feet. 

The crenulate hair is of a uniform, black-walnut color. 

The straight hair measures 7.5 centimeters on the back and shoulders, 
where it is longest. It overtops the crenulate hair by about 2.5 centi- 
meters. Its length at other points is as follows:

The eyelashes are 1 centimeter in length. The claws are pale horn- 
color at the base, but darker on the exposed portion. The skin is white. 
The lips and nostrils are of a dull-reddish or purplish brown. The 
soles of the feet are sooty. The eyes are brown.

Various views have been held regarding their taxonomic relations to 
the Black Bear, Ursus americanus, and to each other, the value of 
which can be determined only when a considerable number of skulls 
and skins shall be brought together. 

Among the varieties of the Black Bear mentioned by authors is one 
called the "Yellow Bear of Carolina." No description of this animal 
occurs anywhere, so far as I am aware, except in Griffith's Cuvier's An- 
imal Kingdom. For sake of comparison it may not be amiss to quote 
what is said regarding it. It is as follows: "The Baron [Cuvier] also 
thinks that the Yellow Bear of Carolina is a variety of the same species. 
This is scientifically termed Ursus lutreolus. We shall not venture to 
assert in contradiction to the Baron that this bear forms a distinct spe- 
cies, but assuredly it is a very strongly marked variety. Major Smith 
took a sketch of one at New York -, the specimen was semi-adult. He 
does not consider that there is sufficient proof of its being a distinct 
species. In the specimen drawn by the major there was a greater con- 
vexity of forehead and a shari)er nose than in the Black Bear. This 
comparison was easily made, as the two animals were chained very 
near each other. The ears of the*Yellow Bear stood more back, were 
not quite so large, and the physiognomy was very different.* Both 
were remarkably tame. Although the Yellow Bear cannot be affirmed 
to be specifically different, yet it is certain that there is a distinct race 
of the animals. They were formerly common in Virginia, and they are 
still abundant in Northwestern Louisiana, where they are called White 
Bears, and are said to feed chiefly on honey, on acorns of a large size, 
wild berries, &c. 

*It iriiist be remembered that this specimen of the Ursus luteolus yvRahnt semi-adult, 
P[idgeon]. 



656 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

"The Cinnamon Bear in the Tower appears to be of the same race as 
this Yellow Bear."* 

Richardson, writing iu 1829, alludes to a Cinuamou Bear as follows : 

'' The Cinnamon Bear of the fur traders is considered by the Indians 
to be an accidental variety of this si)ecies [U. americanus], and they are 
borne out in this opinion by the quality of the fur, which is equally fine 
with that of the Black Bear."t 

Audubon and Bachman, in their " Quadrupeds of North America," 
make the following allusion to a Cinnamon Bear: 

" The Cinnamon Bear, so far as we have been able to ascertain, is never 
found near the sea coast, nor even west of the Ohio Valley until you ap- 
proach the Eocky Mountain chain, and it is apparently quite a different 
animal,"! ^^^ again " sparingly- found in the fur countries west and 
north of the Missouri, extending to the barren grounds of the North- 
west." § 

Other Cinnamon Bears were described by Professor Baird in 1859, 
from the coiiper mines of the Gila River, New Mexico. Regarding the 
specimens which he had under observation, he says: "Although about 
the size of the common black bear, Ursus americanus, or a little smaller, yet 
four skulls of all ages before me, when comi^ared with a corresponding 
series of seven of Ursits americanus, exhibit such characteristic differ- 
ences as to authorize the conclnsion that the species is distinct." || In 
spite of these remarks, however, he places an interrogation mark after 
the name '"Ursus cinnamoneus.'''"\\ 



DESCRIPTION OF A TiEW PETREIi FROm AI>ASIiA. 

By ROBERT RIDGWAY, 

Curator, Department of Birds, United States National Museum. 

An interesting collection of birds lately received at the National 
Museum from Mr. William J. Fisher, U. S. Tidal Observer at Saint 
Paul, Kodiak Island, Alaska, contains a specimen of a very handsome 
Petrel, which appears to be undescribed, and which, in honor of its dis- 
coverer, I propose to name and describe as 

CEsTRELATA FiSHERi, sp, nov. Fisher's Petrel.

margin mainly of the same color; rest of under surface of the wing, 
including inner webs of primaries, uniform pure white, the latter having

shaft, the white being margined for a short distance along the terminal 
portion with grayish ; axillars mainly plumbeous, or barred with the 
same. ]:^ape, back, scapulars, rump, upper tail-coverts, and middle tail-

color (many shades darker than the back); greater coverts, secondaries, 
and tertials i)lumbeous-gTay (more silvery toward edge of wing), very 
distinctly edged with pure white; three outer primaries and primary 
coverts slate-black, the inner quills gradually moie grayish, and nar- 
rowly bordered with white ; bill uniform deep black ; tarsi, most of 
basal phalanx of inner toe, and basal portion of webs, light brownish 
(apparently flesh-coloi-ed or lilaceous in life) ; rest of the feet dusky.

base, .40 ; tarsus, 1.35 ; middle toe, 1.40. 

This elegant Petrel, probably the handsomest of the genus, belongs 
to the delicately-formed, slender-billed group which includes Q?. coolH 
(Gray), (E. gavia (Forst.), (E. desolata (Gm.), and ffi. defiUipiana (Gigl. & 
Salvad.). It is apparently most nearly allied to the last named, from 
which, however, it may be distinguished by the following characters: 
(E. Jisheri. Lower parts chiefly smoky x>lumbeous on the surface, this 
color nearly uniform on the bellj^ and flanks ; greater wing-coverts, 
secondaries, and tertials silvery plumbeous, broadly edged with pure 
white, and in very conspicious contrast with the blackish slate lesser- 
covert, area; rectrices (except middle pair) white, transversely ver- 
miculated with grayish. Wing, 10.15 ; tail, 4 ; culmen, 1 ; tarsus, 1.35 ;

six middle rectrices uniform cinereous, the outer pair with exterior 

webs uniform white. Wing, 9; tail, 3.80; culmen, 1.04; tarsus, 1.07; 

middle toe, with claw, 1.40. Hob. — Eastern South Pacitic (off" coast 

of Peru). 

The comparison with (E. dejlllipiana resting only on the description 
and a colored plate, it may be, therefore, that some of the differential 
characters adduced in the above comparative diagnosis would not be 
found to hold good on actual examination of specimens. This is par- 
ticularly liable to be the case regarding the coloration of the rectrices in 
CE. dejillipiana, which are not described with sufficient detail, while the 
figure may not be perfectly accurate so far as this feature is concerned. 

The most nearly related species with which I have been able to com- 
pare (E. Jisheri is Q^. {jnlaris Peale. The latter, however, is very dis- 
tinct, the coloration being in almost every respect dissimilar, while the 
bill is much stouter through the base, and the tarsi and toes decidedly 
shorter. 

A Petrel captured in Livingston County, New York, in April, 1880, 
described by Mr. Brewster in the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological 
Club for April, 1881, and there referred to (E. gularis, seems, judging 
from the descrijjtion, to belong rather to (E. Jisheri. Should such ijrovo 
to be the case, Mr. Brewster was evidently wrong in his determination. 
The specimen in question was compared with the type of (E. gtdaris, 
and the differences of plumage ascribed to difference of age of the two 
specimens; bnt no fact in ornithology can be more thoroughly estab- 
lished than that, with the possible exception of the Albatrosses, the Petrels 
have no distinct progressive stages of plumage, the young assuming with 
their first feathers the fully adult livery. 



DE.t^CKIPTION OF A !>$PE:CIES OF WIIITKFIimi, CORECJOIVB. « IIOVI 
(OIIjI.) JORDAN, €AI.I>E1> "SMEI.T" IN SOIVIF PAKTS OF J\FU' 
YORK. 

By TARLETOX H. BEAN. 

Our attention has recently been called by the Ei>,v. W. M. Beauchamp 
to a species of "smelt" in some lakes in l^ew York, and finally Mr. J. 
C. Willetts has forwarded numerous specimens of this fish from Skane- 
ateles. This is not an Osmerus, as the common name would imply, but 
a little-known Goregonus, and worthy of description. 

The largest New York specimen of this fish now in the collection is 
numbered 32162 in the National Museum Eegister; it was obtained in 
Seneca Lake, in June, 1878, by Prof. H. L. Smith, who sent it to the 
Museum. Seven additional examples were received October 2, 1882, from 
Skaneateles, N. Y., whence they were forwarded by Mr. J. C. Willetts. 
The catalogue number of these specimens is 32165. The individuals 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 659 

received from Mr. Willetts vary in length from 5J to 6J inches. Three of 
these examples have the air bladder much distended and filling the 
greater portion of the abdominal cavity. 

The specimen received from Professor Smith, which we take as the ba- 
sis of our description, is 10 inches long. 

The species is most closely related to C. artedi, but differs from it and 
from all other species known to me in many im]iortant characters which 
have been only vaguely indicated in most of the published descriptions. 
It is much more widely separated from C. artedi than is the var. sisco of 
Jordan. 

Description.— Body elongate, moderately compressed, slender. 
Head less compressed than body, its greatest width equaling one-half 
the distance froai tip of lower jaw to nape; the lower jaw projecting con- 
siderably even when the mouth is closed. Mouth large, the maxillary 
reaching to the vertical through the anterior margin of the pupil. Pre- 
orbital bone long and slender, more than one-third as long as the head. 
Supraorbital as long as the eye, four times as long as broad. 

The greatest height of the body is considerably less than the length 
of the head, and is contained five times in the total length without cau- 
dal. The greatest width of the body is less than one- half its greatest 
height. The least height of caudal peduncle equals the length of the 
orbit and about one-third of the greatest height of the body. Scales 
small, nine in an oblique series from the dorsal origin to the lateral line, 
eighty-two tube-bearing scales, and eight in an oblique series from the 
ventral origin to the lateral line. 

The length of the head is one-fourth of the total length to the end of 
the lateral line. The distance of the nape from the tip of the snout is 
nearly one-third of the distance from the tip of the snout to the origin 
of tbe first dorsal. The length of the maxilla is one-third of the length 
of the head. The mandible is one-half as long as the head. Lingual 
teeth present. The eye is as long as the snout and one-fourth as long 
as the head. Gill rakers long and slender, the longest five-sixths as long- 
as the eye; there are fifty-five on the first arch, thirty-five of which are 
below the angle. The insertion of the dorsal is nearer the tip of the 
snout than the end of the middle caudal rays. The longest ray of the 
dorsal equals the greatest length of the ventral and is contained seven 
times in the total length to the end of the middle caudal rays (six and 
two-third times in length to end of lateral line). 

The length of the pectoral is one-sixth of the standard body length. 

The insertion of the ventral is midway between the tip of the snout 
and the end of the middle caudal rays. When the ventral is extended 
the distance of its tip from the vent is only one-fourth of the length of 
the fin. In this respect this species differs widely from C. artedi. 

Colors. — Back grayish silvery; sides silvery; dorsal and caudal with 
darker tips. 

Radial formula.— D. iii, 9; A. ii, 13; Y. i, 12; P. i, 16; scales 9—82—8.

By GEOROE P. MERRILL. 

' This sandstone is a coarse compact rock of a greenish gray color, 
though many of the inckided pebbles are of a rose-red tint. The ce- 
menting material, which is of a greenish color, shows under the micro- 
scope a fibrous structure and remains always light between crossed 
Nicols. It bears very many inclosures of rounded and augular grains 
of hematite, which by reflected light are of a bluish luster somewhat 
resembling menaccanite, but giving no disthict reaction for titanic 
acid when subjected to the proper tests. They are of all sizes up to a 
millimeter in diameter. A section through one of the rose-colored peb- 
bles shows it to be traversed in all directions by numerous fractures iu 
which are included, as if deposited by infiltration, innumerable minute

blood-red particles or scale-like forms characteristic of red hematite 
Wheu the light is shut off from below the stage of the microscope the 
quartz appears as a black opaque mass traversed by aii irregular uct- 
work of anastomosing red lines. The included scales are, apparently, 
sufficiently abundant and evenly disseminated to fully account for the 
red color of the pebbles. Besides the hematite the quartz grains con- 
tain numerous minute cavities, some of which are empty, while others 
contain a liquid and bubble. Numerous very small colorless needle-like 
<jrystals are also present, penetrating the quartz in every direction.

BY TA2iLETO]\ II. BEAIV, 
Curator, Dcparlmtnt of Fishes, U. S. Xalional Museum. 

The lish here to be described as the type of a new species was at 
tirst referred by me to A.ferox* It is number 27705 of the National 
Museum Register. Another example of the same species was previously 
taken at Unalashka by Mr. W. H. Dall. The type of the species was 
obtained at lliuliuk, Unalashka, October 7, 1880, by Mr. Robert King, 
at his wharf. Mr. King first saw the dorsal fin of the fish emerging 
from the water, and this attracted his attention. The animal came up 
into shoal water, and acted as if it meant to go on the beach. Mr. King 
thrust a spear into it and thus secured it. In the stomach I found 
twenty-one individuals of Eumicrotrenms spinosus, most of them adult, 
and one small squid. A cod-like lish was said to have been in the 
stomach also, but I did not see this. It is probable that the fish was 
driven ashore from the adjacent deep water by the torture of a parasite 
found in its flesh; this parasite has been identified with the genus 
Tetrarhynchus by Mr. F. W. True. It is said to be not an uncommon 
thing for the "wolf-fish," as this AJeindosaurus is styled, to throw itself 
on the beach at lliuliuk. 

It should be stated that the first notice of my species is published in 
Bulletin 16, Q. S. National Museum, pages 888 and 880; this volume ap- 
peared early in April, 1883, but the original description was prepared 
much earlier than that date and the printing of it was delayed longer 
than was anticipated. 

AUindosannis ^J^Jsculcqyius differs from A.ferox chiefly in the much 
shorter pectorals and ventrals and in the smaller luimber of ventral 
rays. Owing to the somewhat mutilated condition of the specimen, 
only the skin was preserved in alcohol after full measurements had 
been recorded. 

Description. — The length to the origin of the middle caudal rays 
was 1,L'98 millimeters. The greatest height of the body (123 millimeters) 
is contained 10^ times in the standard length. The depth at the ven- 
* Pioc. U. S. Nat. Mus. IV, p. 259, Dec. 24, ISHI (name only). 



662 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

trals (105 millimeters) is contained 12^ times in the length. The least 
height of the tail is about equal to the length of the middle caudal rays. 
The species is much stouter in the second half of the body than our 
numerous examples of A. ferox. There is a well-marked fleshy keel 
along the median line, beginning a little in front of the ventrals and 
extending to the caudal. 

The greatest length of the bead (208 millimeters) is contained 6^ times 
in the standard length. The width of the interorbital area (40 milli- 
meters) is nearly equal to the diameter of the eye. The length of the 
snout is about twice that of the eye, which is contained nearly 5 times 
in the length of the head. The length of the intermaxillary (150 milli- 
meters) is nearly f that of the head; the bone extends behind the eye 
a distance equal to about ^ of the diameter of the eye. The length of 
the mandible is about 3 times the greatest width of the head. The 
nostril is nearly equally distant from tii> of snout and the anterior mar- 
gin of the eye. 

The first dorsal was more or less broken, so that the lengths of its 
rays are not fully made out. The longest ray measured 235 millimeters. 
The distance of tbe first dorsal from the snout is about the same as the 
length of the head. The beginning of the dorsal, tlie posterior margin 
of the operculum, and the origin of the pectoral are in nearly the same 
vertical. The anterior edge of the first dorsal ray is very finely ser- 
rated. 

The distance of the adipose dorsal from the snout is 5^ times the length 
of the head. The length of the base of this fin is f of its width at the top. 

The distance of the anal from the snout is somewhat more than 7 
times the length of its base. The fifth, and longest, anal ray is ^ as 
long as the intermaxillary, and 3 times as long as the last anal ray. 

The upper caudal lobe is imperfect, so that it cannot be known 
whether or not it was prolonged into a filament. The middle rays are 
equal to the least height of the tail. 

The outer edge of the first pectoral ray is finely serrated. The dis- 
tance of the pectoral from the snout (223 millimeters) is 3 times the 
length of the longest anal ray and 4 times the greatest width of the 
head. The length of the pectoral is less than that of the head by a 
distance equal to half the interorbital width. 

The distance of the ventral from the snout (505 millimeters) equals 4 
times the distance from snout to nape. The length of the ventral is a 
little more than twice that of the middle caudal rays. The first ven- 
tral ray is perfectly smooth (serrate in A. ferox). 

Radial formula: B. 7; D. 39; A. 10; P. I, 12; V. I, 7. 

Vertebrae, 50 (as in A. ferox). 

Color. — General color dark gray, on the lower parts mingled with 
silvery; everywhere iridescent. Dorsal membrane black with steel- 
blue reflections. Adipose dorsal, pectorals and caudal black. Ventrals 
and anal silvery and gray. A row of small translucent spots on each 
side of the lateral line and keel.
