Publications of the Lnited States National Museum 

The scientific publications of the United States National Museum include two 
series, Proceedings of the United States National Museum and United States 
National Museum Bulletin. 

In these series are published original articles and monographs dealing with 
the collections and work of the Museum and setting forth newly acquired facts 
in the fields of anthropology, biology, geology, history, and technology. Copies 
of each publication are distributed to libraries and scientific organizations and 
to specialists and others interested in the various subjects. 

The Proceedings, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate 
form, of shorter papers. These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with 
the publication date of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume. 

In the Bulletin series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear longer, 
separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts) 
and volumes in which are collected works on related subjects. Bulletins are 
either octavo or quarto in size, depending on the needs of the presentation. 
Since 1902 papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum have been 
published in the Bulletin series under the heading Contributions from the United 
States National Herbarium.

LACE-BUG GENERA OF THE WORLD 
(HEMIPTERA: TINGIDAE) « 



By Carl J. Drake and Florence A. Ruhoff 



Introduction 



A treatise of the generic names of the family Tingidae from a global 
standpoint embodies problems similar to those frequently encountered 
in corresponding studies in other animal groups. The more im- 
portant criteria, including such basic desiderata as fixation of type 
species, synonyms, priority, and dates of technical publications 
implicate questions concomitant with recent trends toward the 
clarification and stabilization of zoological nomenclature. 

Zoogeography, predicated and authenticated on the generic level 
by the distribution of genera and species, is portrayed here by means 
of tables, charts, and maps of the tingifauna of the world. This 
visual pattern of distribution helps one to form a more vivid concept 
of the family and its hierarchic levels of subfamilies and genera. 
To a limited extent the data indicate distributional concentrations 
and probable centers of evolution and dispersal paths of genera. 
The phylogenetic relationship of genera is not discussed. 

The present treatise recognizes 216 genera (plus 79 synonyms, 
homonyms, and emendations) of the Tingidae of the world and gives

the figure of 1,767 as the approximate number of species now recog- 
nized. These figures, collated with similar categories in Lethierry 
and Severin (1896), show that there has been an increase of many 
genera and hundreds of species of Tingidae during the past three- 
quarters of a century. And as attested by the number of new forms 
being described each year in technical publications, there are still 
many unknown genera and many more new species yet to be dis- 
covered. 

The three subfamilies of the Tingidae are listed in alphabetic 
sequence. The genera and subgenera (including synonyms, homo- 
nyms, emendations, misapplied names, misspellings, nomina nuda 
(sine species), lapsus calami, and errata) are also alphabetized under 
their respective subfamilies. Although absolute completeness and 
perfection are unattainable, every effort has been taken to formulate 
a complete registery of all generic and subgeneric names, both 
valid and invalid, heretofore proposed in the literature for both 
existing and fossil tingids. Each reference has been checked against 
the original publication. Thus, a number of errors that have crept 
into the literature have been rectified. 

The authors hope that the users of this work will make known 
typographical, technical, and other errors so that corrections may 
be made in the catalog of the Tingidae of the world, now in 
preparation. 

Often it has been difficult to accredit with any degree of certainty 
the first authority accountable for synonymy, subsequent type desig- 
nation of a genus, and other taxonomic changes. When such in- 
formation was not so expressed in the literature, the oldest ascertain- 
able record of the action has been cited as the authoritative citation. 

Accepted or valid generic and subgeneric names are printed in 
boldface type; the invalid or inacceptable names are in lightface 
type. Cross-references are provided to link every synonym, homo- 
nym, emendation, unaccepted name, and error of any type to the 
proper taxon. 

The name of each genus, subgenus, and type species is followed by 
the name of author with date and page reference, thus providing 
identification in the list of literature cited. "Later citation" as used 
herein refers to authors who have correctly cited the type species after 
its fixation; a "previous selection" is a citation made prior to the 
official list of the International Commission on Zoological Nomen- 
clature but is in agreement with that list; "erroneous or invalid 
citations" are explained under the respective genera. 

In searching for new generic records and other taxonomic changes, 
the reader should begin with volume 93 of the Zoological Record 
(1956).

2 The 15th International Congress of Zoology (London, 1958) made provisos for the acceptance of family 
names originally founded in the vernacular— such as Tingidites Laporte (1833) in French— providing such 
usage has been generally accepted. Since Tingidae (for "Tingidites") meets the new code of Zoological 
Nomenclature, we are accrediting "Tingidae" to Laporte, who was the first to use a family name for the 
lace-bugs. It should be noted that all technical and vernacular names for the family always have been 
based upon the generic name of Tingis Fabricius.

Tingitides Puton, 1875, p. 28; 1899, p. 38. 
Tingidides Vollenhoven, 1878, p. 9. 

Type genus: Tingis Fabricius (1803, p. 224). 

The family Tingidae comprises a moderately large assemblage of 
insects ranging rarely more than 2-5 mm. in length. The spe- 
cies are entirely plant-feeders, and both adults and nymphs 
obtain food by sucking out the juices from the cells of the tissues 
within the living plants. At times they occur in sufficient numbers 
to constitute an important plant-pest. 

Adults and offspring live on the underside of the leaves of the host 
plants. Their presence soon betrays itself by the appearance of 
whitish and discolored spots on the upperside of the leaves just above 
the place of feeding. Many species are gregarious and both adults 
and nymphs cluster near the spot where the eggs were laid. The 
life-cycle is relatively short, two or more generations usually being 
passed during the growing season. Metamorphosis, called hemi- 
metabola, is gradual. 

Many different kinds of wild and cultivated plants serve as feeding 
and breeding hosts. Among the common economic hosts might be 
mentioned such plants as cotton, sugarcane, eggplant, cassava, rubber, 
pear, apple, cherry, avocado, almond, tea, coffee, banana, cacao, 
coconut, camphor, black pepper, and olive. Shade and forest trees, 
shrubs, herbs, grasses, and decorative plants also serve as primary 
hosts. Mosses, too, are inhabited. Members of three genera found 
in Africa, Australia, Asia, and southern Europe are typical gall- 
forming insects. Distribution, except for the lands of the Arctic and 
Antarctic Zones, is practically worldwide. 

As a familial group, tingids are separated from almost all other 
families 3 of the order Hemiptera by the intricate pattern of delicate 
lacework occurring all over the processes of the pronotum and of the 
fore pair of wings. On account of their lacy appearance, tingids are 
known globally by the same colloquial name, "lace-bugs," and once 
seen they are thus easily recognized. The immature stages are often 
adorned with long, plain or modified spines, only the adults being 
clothed with lacework in different specific patterns. 

The question is frequently asked, "What is the use or function, if 
any, of the lacy dorsal covering of tingids?" Perhaps it is for pro- 
tective concealment. For similar reasons man himself makes use of 
"nets" or "screens" of various kinds to conceal or camouflage stra- 
tegic objects from the eyes of enemies, especially from the air. Color 
and markings also enter into the picture. 



• Members of the hemipterous families Piesmatidae and Peloridiidae also have the dorsal surface of their 
bodies composed of lacework, but phylogenetically neither is very closely allied to Tingidae or to each other. 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 5 

In the subfamily Tinginae, members of many genera at times are 
said to "run wild" structurally in the development of unique and 
fanciful forms of specific designs in lacework. The pepper tingid 
(fig. 1) of the South Pacific is only one of hundreds of such creations. 
Many species in other genera are at least just as ornately clothed 
and befittingly decorated in singular lacy structures. There are no 
replicas nor facsimiles among species, because each species possesses 
its own form, pattern, and style of lacework. Both generic and 
specific characters used in the identification of lace-bugs are based 
largely upon lacy structures. Only with the aid of illustrations can 
such unequaled oddities of intricate lacework be described adequately 
for taxonomic studies.

Hemipterists are almost entirely of the opinion that the families 
Tingidae and Piesmatidae are not very closely related and thus 
together did not form a natural higher taxon. According to a recent 
paper by Drake and Davis (1958, p. 572), evidences from external 
morphology and reproductive organs of males and females of the two 
families do not substantiate the retention of the superfamily Tin- 
goidea for these families. Consequently, those authors suppressed the 
superfamily as then constituted. 

The myrmecophile family Vianaididae was erected by Kormilev 
(1955, p. 465-477) to hold a new genus and new species, Vianaida 
coleopterata Kormilev, and another monobasic genus, Anommotocoris 
minutissimus China (1945, pp. 126-128) described from Trinidad, 
British West Indies. As the families Tingidae and Vianaididae are 
without ventral trichobothria and both belong to the group Cimi- 
comorpha of Leston, Pendergrast, and Southwood (1954, pp. 91-94), 
Kormilev suggested that these two families may be consociates so as 
to form a superfamiry Tingidoidea (sensu novum). The relationship 
of these families and the status of the proposed superfamily "Tingi- 
doidea" (proper spelling should be Tingoidea) are now being critically 
studied and will be discussed in a subsequent paper dealing with the 
morphology and higher classification of Tingidae. 

Except for the characterization of many new genera and several 
hundred species, tingids have received scant attention for many 
decades in the taxonomic hierarchy of higher categories ascending 
from the generic to ordinal rank. Obviously the subfamilies and 
particularly some of the larger polytypic genera (Tingis, Leptopharsa, 
and Cysteochila, for examples) need more thorough analyses, both 
objectively and subjectively, from a worldwide aspect so that such 
heterogenous taxa can be better understood and especially delimited. 
Their constituents can then be more concretely tied into the generic 
concept of their respective type species. 

The progenitors and other pioneer genera at times have served as 
temporary repositories ("catch-alls") for many new species of doubtful 
or even unknown generic affinities ever since the days of Linnaeus and 
Fabricius. For example, the genera Phyllontocheila and Monanthia, 
both recently buried in synonynvy, formed generic anchors for the 
erection of a number of subgenera which have been withdrawn 
for elevation to the generic level. An examination of the specific 
names also reveals that more than 100 species of tingids originally 
described as Monanthia have been transferred to other, sometimes 
newly created, genera. Several genera now recognized as valid, such 
as Tingis, Cysteochila, and Leptopharsa, still hold some species of 
doubtful generic affinities. 

In the only catalog so far published on the Hemiptera (Heteroptera; 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 7 

Miridae not included) of the world, Lethierry and Severin (1896, 
pp. 4-26) recorded a total of only 50 genera and 317 species of Tingidae 
for all five continents and the islands of the seas. Forty years later, 
Drake and Poor (19.36a, p. 381) enumerated 52 genera from the 
Western Hemisphere alone. The latter authors also stated that 424 
species had been described from the Americas and estimated that 
approximately 1,100 species were then characterized in the world. 
Monte (1947) published a list (incomplete) of 99 tingid genera (in- 
cluding synonyms) and their respective type species for the world. 

Two basic and monumental treatises have been written on the 
family Tingidae. Horvath (1906c) published a very comprehensive 
stud} r of the Tingidae of the Palearctic subregion, with original keys 
to genera and species. He recognized 19 valid genera and 201 valid 
species for the Palearctic subregion. Hurd (1946) published descrip- 
tions and original keys to the 44 genera known to occur in North 
America. This author gave the figure 424 as the number of known 
species at that time inhabiting the Americas north of the Panama 
Canal. 

Inasmuch as the foregoing papers dealt with land areas of various 
extents, involving diverse biotic conditions and even overlapping 
fauna! regions, the data are too disparate to trace growth and to 
compare generic and specific populations in different faunal areas. 

In a lengthy paper dealing with the Rhynchota, Amyot (1845, 
pp. 369-492; 1846, pp. 73-192) proposed a monomial system to 
replace the binomial nomenclature as originally organized by Lin- 
naeus (1758). This new system, mononymy, would classify animals 
by means of a one-word taxon representing both genus and species in 
lieu of the binary system of two words, one for genus and the other for 
species. This monomial system of Amyot was never seriously con- 
sidered by entomologists, nor recognized in the Zoological Code. 

Under Division in, Membranientes, Amyot (1846, pp. 175-192) 
mononymized technical names for a number of species of tingids and 
piesmatids. In the transition from the binomial to the monomial 
system, he employed several well-known generic names and created 
a number of new monomial names. Only one of the mononymic taxa 
was created for a new tingid species, the others being erected for 
well-known species of that time. This mononymic species, "Dic- 
tyesthes," described by Amyot (1846, p. 181), has been cited by 
Garbiglietti (1869, p. 275) as Dictyonota dictyesthes Amyot. The 
publication of Garbiglietti (1869) validated D. dictyesthes as a specific 
name and thus credit of authorship must be given to Garbiglietti 
rather than to Amyot. 

In his "Nomenclator Zoologicus," Neave (1939-1950) wrongly 
included the monomial names of species named or renamed by 



8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. hj 

Amyot as generic names and credited them to Amyot as such. This 
is a serious error. Since Amyot's names are not true generic names 
and have no nomenclatorial standing, they are not included herein in 
the present treatise of the generic names of Tingidae of the world. 
The authors hope that the above comments will prevent further 
confusion and use of these monomial names. 

In his catalog of the Hemiptera, Walker (1873, pp. 175-179) in- 
cluded only two families, Tingididae and Piesmidae, in the Mem- 
branacea, and divided a number of tingid genera into "Divisions" 
and "Subdivisions." For the new taxa below the generic level, 
Walker used a jumble of scientific names of other workers. These 
names were wrongly employed, wrongly synonymized, and wrongly 
classified by him. Since no new generic or subgeneric names are in- 
volved, the present authors are following previous catalogers and 
omitting Walker's names of generic and subgeneric divisions. 

The proper form of the family name of the lace-bugs was an item 
of contention for more than a century. The moot point of the con- 
troversy rested almost entirely upon finding the correct "root" and 
"stem" of the type generic term Tingis of Fabricius. These items 
have been amiably and consummately investigated by Holland (1922a; 
1922b; 1924), Baker (1922; 1923), Parshley (1922a; 1922b), and 
Schmitz (1935). Their findings showed much diversity of opinions 
and little unanimity as to the origin and status of " Tingis." 

In January 1923, Baker submitted to the International Commission 
of Zoological Nomenclature a concise summary of the findings and 
conclusions on the controversy of Holland, Parshley, and himself, 
including a request for a ruling on the origin and formation of the 
word "Tingis." To quote from Opinion 143 of the International 
Commission of Zoological Nomenclature (1943, pp. 83-85): 

Tingis dtant un nom latin dont le genitif est Tingis et l'accusatif Tingim, 
TINGIDAE est la forme correcte du nom de la famille. 

The ruling was: 

The family name for Tingis Fabricius, 1803 (Syst. Rhyng.: 124) in the Hemip- 
tera is TINGIDAE. 

Beginning with volume 59 (1922), the Zoological Record has con- 
tinually used the family name Tingidae for the lace-bugs. That 
spelling under the R6gles has been universally accepted as the proper 
family name for the lace-bug family. 

Stal (1873, p. 116) and Distant (1903c, pp. 122-145) both used the 
higher categories as divisions for the family Tingidae, although 
Distant placed a few genera in the wrong division. These categories 
were Cantacaderaria, Serenthiaria, and Tingidaria. Later, Distant 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 9 

(1909, pp. 121-122) created two new divisions: Axiokersosaria, for 
the reception of Axiokersos ovalis Distant, from India; and Aidoneu- 
saria to hold Aidoneus dissimilis Distant. As the characters of these 
two new divisions will not always separate them from genera of the 
division Tingidaria, they are both synonymizcd here with Tinginae 
(olim Tingidaria) . 

Since Distant's (1903c) work titled "The Fauna of British India" 
is used so extensively in systematic studies, the present equivalent 
taxa for the above divisions are listed here: 

Cantacaderaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Cantacaderinae. 
Serenthiaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Agrammatinae. 
Tingidaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Tinginae. 
Axiokersosaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Tinginae. 
Aidoneusaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Tinginae. 

Blatchley (1926) subdivided the subfamily Tinginae into three new 
tribes for the reception of the genera occurring in eastern North 
America. The status of these tribes is discussed below in the order 
of their erection. 

Tribe Galeatini Blatchley (1926, p. 451) comprises the genera 
Galeatus, Corythuca (error for Coryihucha), Stephanitis, Leptobyrsa 
(not Stal), Corythaica, Dictyonota, Gargaphia, Gelchossa, Leptodiclya, 
and Acanthocheila. Gelchossa is a synonym of Leptopharsa (p. 58). 
Leptobyrsa is a South American genus not represented in the United 
States. As used by Blatchely (not Stal), Leptobyrsa is synonymous 
with Stephanitis, and thus Stephanitis blatchleyi Drake (1925b, p. 37) 
and S. rhododendri Horvath (1905, p. 567) were wrongly transferred by 
him from their original generic position to this genus. Galeatini is not 
applicable for the inclusion of some of the American genera as well 
as many related genera in the Old AVorld, and it is here suppressed 
as a synonym of the subfamily Tinginae (p. 31). 

The tribal name Acalyptini Blatchley (1926, p. 479) was established 
to hold the genera Acalypta and Drakella. As the latter is a synonym 
of the former, only Acalypta is left in the tribe. Acalyptini is not a 
valid tribe and thus is treated here as a synonym of Tinginae (p. 31). 

The tribal name Physatocheilini Blatchley (1926, p. 483) was 
established to include the genera Physatocheila, Dichocysta, Tingis, 
Teleonemia, and Leptoypha. The characters employed by Blatchley 
in his tribal descriptions and key couplets do not correspond to those 
of the genus Physatocheila itself, those of all the species of Teleonemia 
of South America; nor those of some genera found in insular America, 
South America, and the Old World. Thus, it becomes necessary 
here to synonymize the tribe Physatocheilini with Tinginae (p. 31).

Fossil Fornis 

Fossil records are too few to tell much about tingids in geologic 
time. The molds of the species that became entangled and engulfed 
in amber, both Baltic and Prussian, belong to existing genera, though 
specifically representing quite different species. Most of the petrified 
forms also belong to existing genera. Table 1 summarizes the distribu- 
tion of fossil species. There are 6 genera and 9 species, plus 4 species

determined only as u Tingis sp." The genera not represented by 
present-day species are mentioned below. 

Eotingis Scudder (1890, p. 359) was erected to hold antennata 
Scudder (p. 360, fig.) from the United States (Florissant, Colorado. 
Horizon, Oligocene) and Tingis quinquecarinata Germar and Berendt 
(1856, p. 23, figs.), found in Prussian amber. Since T. quinque- 
carinata is being transferred to the genus Cantacader of the subfamily 
Cantacaderinae, this now leaves Eotingis with the genotype as its 
only member.

Eotingis quinquecarinata Scudder, 1890, p. 359; 1891, p. 406. 

Scudder (1890, p. 359) wrongly transferred Tingis quinquecarinata 
Germar and Berendt to the genus Eotingis Scudder. The original 
description and the two fine illustrations of T. quinquecarinata show 
that species to be a typical member of the genus Cantacader Amyot 
and Serville, and it is herein transferred. 

For an unusual fossil found in southern Russia, Bekker-Migdisova 
(1953) created for its reception the name Tingiopsis reticulata in the 
family Tingidae. A study of the venation of the hemelytron of tbis 
fossil species shows that it does not fall into the classification of the 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 11 

family Tingidae of the Hcmiptera. To the present authors, the wing 
appears to be that of a homopteron, perhaps the family Psyllidae. 

In a recent paper Evans (1957, p. 289) placed Tingiopsis reticulata 
in the family Cercopidae of the Ilomoptera. Until more specimens 
are found that will provide better structural characters on the familial 
level, the species should be left in family Cercopidae.

Chorology 

Faunal Divisions 

The partitioning of the world into faunal realms, regions, subregions, 
and provinces has been a concern of zoogeographers for more than 
a century. The basic concepts and features of faunal divisions were 
formulated by such eminent scholars as Swainson (1835), Sclater 
(1858; 1874), Darwin (1859), Huxley (1868), and Wallace (1876). 
The recent book by Darlington (1957) on zoogeography and the one 
by Lindroth (1957) on faunal connections between Europe and America 
are classics in their respective fields. All of the above publications 
also have been most helpful in charting the chorology of the existing 
tingifauna by regions. 

Schmidt's (1954) schemes of faunal division and maps of the world 
(figs. 2, 3) based on grid North Pole with continents radiating in 
their relative positions have been followed rather closely. As our 
data failed to lend themselves fully into the lower subdivisions of 
provinces, the faunal tabulations of genera and of species were not 
carried further than the subregions. For the same reasons the Carib- 
bean Transition subregion and the Celebesian Transition province 
were not included in the tables.

Figure 2. — Faunal realms of the world. 



The genera and species of living tingids as they are known today 
are treated chorologically in table 2. There appear to be no truly 
relict species. Morphologically, the Cantacaderinae represent the 
oldest and most primitive subfamily, and two of its genera are 
well represented by both living and fossil forms. The genus Dictyla 
of the subfamily Tinginae contains more species and is more widely 
distributed than any other genus of this subfamily comprising both 
extinct and living species. 

The literature shows that certain regions such as Europe, North 
America, Brazil, Belgian Congo, and Japan have received more 
attention taxonomically than many other areas. Tingids are poorly 
known from many islands of the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. 
Many parts of the Orient, Africa, and South America have also 
received scant consideration. 

The circular graphs (figs. 4, 5) depict the genera and species by 
faunal subregions. The Ethiopian subregion is represented by 296 
species divided among 65 genera, the Oriental by 256 species among 
67 genera, and the Neotropical by 594 species among 60 genera. The 
larger genera in the Neotropical indicate that many genera of this 
subregion are less primitive than those found in the Ethiopian and 
Oriental regions.

Of all the tingids found in the Eastern Hemisphere, there is only- 
one — Stephanitis pyrioides, in Argentina — that is recorded in South 
America. Several species occur in both the Nearctic and Neotropical 
subregions, but there are more species shared by faunal subregions in 
the Old World than in the Americas.

Figure 4. — Distribution of tingid genera by faunal subregions. 



Faunal Exchange 

Natural: Numerous genera are shared by two or more faunal 
subregions (table 2). Distribution of existing species is shown in 
figure 5 and in table 2. The fossil species are treated in table 1. 

Natural emigration of tingids is a more or less continuous phenom- 
enon and varies greatly with the biotic potential and vagility of the 
species. The faunal subregions (figs. 3-5) with land-connections such 
as the Nearcticand Neotropical, and the Palearctio, Oriental, and Ethi- 
opian subregions share more genera and species than subregions with- 
out such connections, such as Soul h America and Australia, and Sout b 
America and Africa. Some tingid species have disseminated over large 
areas, although most species are not very active or strong fliers and 
are rather sedentary in habit. Macroptery and brachyptery are 
present in a considerable number of species. The brachypterous form 
has metathoracic or flight wings atrophied or entirely absent. Apterous 
forms are unknown. 

Imported: Only a few species of Tingidac from the Old World 
have been introduced across the seas into the Americas through the 
agency of man, all unintentionally. However, only one transport has 
occurred in the opposite direction, and that purposely. The latter 
case concerns the purposeful introduction of Teleonemia scrupulosa

Stal from the neo tropics into the Hawaiian Islands for the "biological 
control" of the noxious lantana plant, previously imported there as 
a decorative flowering shrub from Mexico. Since then, this tingid 
has been released in numbers for the same purpose in India, Australia, 
Fiji, the Philippines, and islands of the South Pacific and Indian 
Oceans. Teleonemia is an indigenous American genus and records 
of its occurrence in Oceanic, Oriental, Australian, Papuan, Malagasy, 
and Ethiopian subregions are now all referable to T. scrupulosa. 
The species, formerly described from Asia and Africa as members 
of the genus Teleonemia, have all been transferred to other genera 
during the past two decades. 

Caloloma uhleri Drake and Bruner, originally described from the 
West Indies, seems to be an accidentally introduced species from Aus- 
tralia. During the past decade, three small lots of C. uhleri have been 
identified from Queensland. As no specimen of this species has been 
seen from insular America since its characterization, it appears 
doubtful that it has been able to establish itself in the Lesser Antilles. 

The genus Dictyonota of the Old World is represented solely in the 
Nearctic by the unintentionally imported species D. tricornis (Schrank) 
(described as variety americana ParshlejO from Europe. This species 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 21 

has become a permanent resident and is now found in several New- 
England States and eastern Canada. 

Corythucha morrilli Osborn and Drake, new immigrant in Hawaii, 
is a native of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and the West 
Indies. 

Through international commerce (dormant nursery plants), three 
Palearctic species of the genus Stephanitis accidentally have been 
shipped into and became established in eastern United States: *S. 
globulifcra (Matsumura) and S. pyrioides (Scott) from Japan, and 
S. rhododendri Horv&th from Europe. Stephanitis rhododendri was 
originally described by Horvdth (1905, p. 567) from Holland. Distant 
(1910c, p. 396) theorized that the species had been introduced into 
Europe from India, "the headquarters of the genus Rhododendron in 
the Himalayan region." Johnson (1936, pp. 345-346) presents a 
different hypothesis relative to the dissemination of the rhododendron 
lace-bug. Contrary to other authors, he believes that S. rhododendri 
is indigenous to America (eastern United States) and that its occur- 
rence in Europe originated from the shipments of dormant nursery 
plants of Rhododendron and Azalea from eastern United States. 

Lounsbury (1923, p. 548) states that S. rhododendri gained entrance 
into South Africa through large shipments of rhododendron plants. 
In this connection, it is interesting to record that we have received 
several specimens of S. pyrioides from Australia (Lone Cove, New 
South Wales), taken there on azalea. 

In the subfamily Agrammatinae (olim Serenthiinac) there are 56 
species distributed among five genera. Fossil forms are unknown. 
The subfamily is represented in six of the faunal subregions of the 
world (table 2). It is not known to inhabit the Nearctic, Papuan, 
New Zealandian, and Oceanic subregions. An indigenous genus, 
Coleopterodes, with two species, is the only genus found in the Neo- 
tropical subregion, and the only one inhabiting the New World. 

Agramma is by far the largest and most widely distributed genus. 
It comprises 17 species in the Palearctic subregion, 22 in the Ethi- 
opian, 10 in the Oriental, 1 in the Malagasy, and 1 in the Australian. 
Of the 49 described species, two occupy two subregions. 

The subfamily Cantacaderinae, apparently the most primitive of 
the Tingidae, comprises an aggregate of 86 species separated among 
21 genera. Unlike the other subfamilies, there are no discordant 
genera in the cantacadcrines. In fact, considering all genera and 
their components together, the entire subfamily forms a readily 
recognizable, homogeneous unit with combinations of characters that 
distinctly set them apart from both Tinginae and Agrammatinae. 

Cantacadcrines are represented in the Neotropical, Oriental, Mala- 
gasy, Oceanic, Papuan, Ethiopian, New Zealandian, and Australian 



22 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

subregions (table 2). Phatnoma is by far the most widespread of all 
of the genera, and the only genus so far shared by both the Old and 
New Worlds. Cantacader, with 27 components, is the largest genus, 
and it is best represented in the Ethiopian and Oriental subregions. 
Of all the cantacaderines, only one species of Cantacader and one of 
Phatnoma are shared by two faunal subregions. The members of 
the remaining 19 genera are much more localized, only Gonycentrum 
(in three subregions) being known to occur in more than one subregion. 

Paradoxically, an anomalous element enters into the distribution 
of the cantacaderines in the Holarctic region. There is a complete 
absence of species, both living and extinct, in the entire Nearctic 
subregion. In the Palearctic subregion, fossils of two genera (three 
species) have been found entombed in Baltic and Prussian ambers, 
and, singularly, only one living species is now known to exist in south- 
ern Europe. 

The subfamily Tinginae constitutes by far the largest (in both 
number of genera and of species) and the most generally distributed 
subfamily of the lace-bugs. It is represented in all the world's 
faunal subregions except the Arctic and Antarctic. Some of the 
muscicoline species, such as members of the genus Acalypta, have 
been collected far north in Eurasia and North America. The north- 
ernmost species so far found in the Americas is the muscivorus 
Acalypta nyctalis Drake, which has been found breeding in mosses 
in Alaska (Fairbanks and Fort Richardson) and northern Canada 
(near Alaska and in Newfoundland) . Acalypta tends to be northern 
in distribution and is not represented south of Mexico. Its members 
fall among the older forms of the subfamily. 

This subfamily is represented by 1,625 existing species divided 
among 188 genera (table 2). Both genera and species are most 
abundant in tropical and subtropical regions, although the temperate 
zones are also well represented. Approximately one-third of all the 
members of the subfamily are recorded from the Neotropical sub- 
region (table 2). The average number of species in a genus is greater 
in this faunal area than in any of the other subregions. 

There are 125 genera in one faunal subregion; 36 in two subregions; 
10 in three subregions; 6 in four subregions; 6 in five subregions; 
2 (Dictyla and Tingis) in six subregions; and 2 (Paracopium and 
Slephaniiis) in seven subregions. 

Only a few species of the subfamily Tinginae have been found 
fossilized. The fossil genera Celaniia, Dictyla, and Tingis are repre- 
sented by existing species.

Type genus: Agramma Stephens (1829a). 

Remarks: Because the name of the type genus, Agramma, is neuter 
(from the Greek, stem "Agrammatos"), the correct spelling of the 
subfamily name is "Agrammatinae," not "Agramminae." 

Van Duzee (1917, p. 223) wrongly included a genus and species 
of piesmatid as a Nearctic representative of this subfamily.

Agramma Stephens (1829a, p. 64; 1829b, p. 336). 

Type species: Tingis laela Fallen (1807, p. 40). See plate 1, herein.

Note: China (1943, p. 248) resurrected Agramma Stephens — until 
then wrongly accredited in the literature to Westwood (1840, 
p. 120) — as a valid genus based upon a well-known included 
species (Tingis laeta Fallen, 1807). Agramma is not a nomen 
nudum, as theretofore cited, and has priority by 12 years over 
Serenthia. The tj^pe species of the latter is congeneric with 
laeta Fallen. Wagner (1941, pp. 1-27, figs.) divided the genus 
Serenthia Spinola into four subgenera: Agramma Westwood, 
Serenthia Spinola, Serenthiella, and Paraserenihia. Drake (1956d, 
p. 7) pointed out that Wagner's new subgenera (Serenthiella and 
Paraserenihia) were not applicable for the inclusion of many of 
the Old World species and relegated all into synonymy as insep- 
arable from typical Serenthia. Wombalia Schouteden was sup- 
pressed by Drake (1954a, p. 13) as a synonym of Serenthia.

Homonym: Solenostoma. 

Note: As both generic and specific names of Coleopterodes fuscescens 
Philippi (1864) and of Solenostoma liliputiana Signoret (1863) 
were created to hold identical species, they are consequently 
synonyms. The preoccupation of Solenostoma (1863) (homonym) 
by a genus of fishes gives antecedence to Coleopterodes Philippi 
(junior synonym) as the valid generic name and liliputiana 
(Signoret) survives as the valid specific name by priority. See

Type species: Epimixia roboris Drake (1942b, p. 12). 

Fixation: Present designation. 

Note: This genus is erected here to hold Epimixia roboris from 
Madagascar. 

Description: Moderately large, oblong. Head short, very little 
extended in front of eyes, inserted into prothorax up to hind mar- 
gins of eyes, armed with not more than five spines, antenniferous 
tubercles short, blunt, rounded in front; bucculae rather short, 
areolate, with ends meeting in front. Labium rather short, 
stout, reaching very little beyond presternum; laminae not very 
high, uniseriate, widely separated on both mesosternum and 
metasternum, open behind. Scent gland ostiole and channel 
plainly visible, with sulcus extending nearly upright. Hypocostal 
laminae long, uniseriate. Legs rather short, with femora 
slightly incrassate, tarsi considerably swollen. 

Pronotum with lateral sides slowl} 7 converging anteriorly in front 
of humeri, very little swollen across humeral angles, coarsely 
reticulately punctate, unicarinate, lateral carinae completely 
wanting; collar distinct, with two encircling rows of small pits; 
paranota very narrow, cariniform, without areolae, slightly wider 
opposite calli and there with indistinct cells; posterior process 
triangular, areolate. 

Elytra a little longer and slightly wider than abdomen, also slightly 
wider than pronotum at humeri (scarcely more than width of 
costal areas), divided into the usual areas; costal area horizontal, 
uniseriate; subcostal area wider, subvertical; discoidal area large, 
extending slightly beyond middle of elytra; sutural area on same 
level as discoidal, both areas flat and on same horizontal level. 

Distinguishingcharacteristies : Allied to the genus EpimixiaKirknldy 
of the Australian subregion, but easily distinguishable by the 
somewhat more depressed and unicarinate pronotum, depressed 
and almost flat underside of the abdomen, swollen tarsi, and the

from 10 specimens, Antigua (San Juan), Lesser Antilles. During 
the past decade, three small lots of typical specimens of this

latter records prove that C. uhleri is an Australian indigene. 
And since no specimens of C. uhleri have subsequently been net- 
ted in the West Indies, there is some doubt relative to the prov- 
enance of the type specimens. The specimens from insular 
America probably represent either an incidental introduction 
or an accidental mislabeling. The type series is in the U.S.

(Linnaeus), belongs to Copium; M. rotundata (Herrich-Schaeffer) 
belongs to Octacysta, new genus; and the rest are all transferred 
herein to Didyla Stal. 
Validity of Copium clavicornis (Linnaeus) : Two centuries ago 
Linnaeus (1758, p. 442) characterized Cimex clavicornis in these 
words : 

clavicornis. 12. C. elytris abdomen occultantibus reticulato punctatis, 
antennis clavatis. Fn. Svec. 687. Habitat in Europa. 

The citation "Fn. Svec." refers to "Fauna Svecica" by Linnaeus 
(1746, p. 121) and "687" refers to the description of a new Cimex 
without a specific name, the habitat of which is given as "in 
Uplandia. in Scania." Scania is the former name of a province 
in extreme southern Sweden. In the 12th edition of "Systema 
Naturae" Linnaeus (1767, p. 717) wrote: 

clavicornis. 16. C. coleoptratus, elytris nervoso-carinatis reticulato punctatis, 
antennis clavatis. Fn. Svec. 911. Reaum. ins. 3. t. 34. f. 1-4. Geoffr. 
paris. l.p. 461. n. 56. Habitat in Europa. 

By citing the two references above, Linnaeus (1767, p. 717) 
himself provided the incontestable evidence needed to identify 
positively his species Cimex clavicornis of Europe. Reaumur 
(1737, p. 427, pi. 34, figs.) gave a good discussion of a gall-making 
insect and its galls on "fleurs du camedrys," including figures 
of both insect and galls. In the other reference Geoffroy (1762, 
p. 461) described the same insect and its galls on "chamedrys." 
The last sentence of Geoffroy's description reads: 

La larve de cette punaise habite l'interieur des fleurs du chamaedrys, qui 
avant de s'ouvrir, paroissent plus grosses & plus gonflees qu'a l'ordinaire, 
lorsque cette larve y est renfermee. 

As Fabricius was a contemporary of Linnaeus and at times 
visited him, it is only natural to assume that he saw and studied 
the "Linnacan Collection." It is evident, too, that they were 
in concurrence regarding the identity of clavicornis as can be 
perceived in the following excerpt from Fabricius (1794, p. 70) : 

clavicornis. 10. A. elytris reticulato punctatis, antennis clavatis. Cimex 
clavicornis. Linn. Syst. nat. 2. 717.16. Fn. Svec. 911. Geoff. Ins. 1. 461. 56. 
Reaum. Ins. e. tab. 34. fig. 1-4. Fyesl. Helvet. 25. 480. Panz. Fn. Germ. 3. 
tab. 24. Habitat in Europae hortis." 

Fieber (1844, p. 97, fig.) founded the genus Laccometopus to hold 
C. clavicornis Linnaeus and L. kollari, both gall-making species. 
Seventeen years later, this author (Fieber 1861, p. 119) again 
treated Linnaeus' clavicornis as in 1844. The host plant as 
cited by the above and other authors of those times is Teucrio 
chamaedri (fide Fieber). 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 47 

The first and so far the only reviser of the Palcarctic species 
of the genus Copium, Wagner (1954, pp. 200-209) correctly 
treated Monanthia clavicornis (Linnaeus) (1758) and Copium 
cornutum Thunberg (1822) as identical species but failed to 
relegate the latter to synonymy. As indicated under Copium 
and Monanthia, the type species of these two genera are con- 
specific, the latter being a junior synonym of the former. For 
information relative to this synonymy, suppressing of Copium 
cornutum with C. clavicornis, and resurrection of Dictyla Stal 
from synonymy to hold almost all of the species included in 
Monanthia, see discussions under Copium, Dictyla, Monanthia, 
and Octacysta. Dr. W. E. China, in personal correspondence, 
states that there are two specimens of tingids under the name 
"Cimex clavicornis L." in the Linnacan Collection at the Lin- 
naean Society of London, Burlington House, Picadilly, and that 
one, in Linnaeus' handwriting, is labeled "Tingis cardui Linn." 
and the other (without label) is Acalypta carinata (Panzer). 
The specimen bearing the label with C. clavicornis L. is the 
thistle tingid that Linnaeus described as C. cardui and it agrees 
with the original description of cardui. These are plainly self- 
evident errors made by others in handling the Linnaean specimens 
during the past two centuries and need no further comments.

Note: Opinion 251 set aside all prior designations of type species 
for the nominal genus Dictyonota Curtis (1827). Hurd (1946, p. 461) 
and Monte (1947, p. 10) both wrongly cited the type species as 
Dictyonota eryngii (Latreille) (described as Tingis), the same 
species incorrectly cited and designated by Curtis at the time he

Fenestrella. Drake (1928d, p. 1) s3 T nonymized Drakella and 

Fenestrella with Acalypta. 

Froggattia Froggatt (1901, p. 1601). 

Type species: Froggattia olivinia Froggatt (1901, p. 1601, fig.). 

Fixation: Froggatt (1901, p. 1601), by monotypy. 

Later citation: Monte (1947, p. 12) wrongly credited both genus 
and type species to Horv&th (1902) as Froggattia olivina. 

Homonym: Froggattia Horvdth. (New homonymy.) 

Note: The olive tingid has heretofore been wrongly accredited to 
Horvdth (1902) as Froggattia olivina, though the description and 
figure by Froggatt (1901) as Froggattia olivinia (wrongly attrib- 
uted by Froggatt himself to Horvtith) has priority by almost one 
year. Under these circumstances the genus and species must be 
credited to Froggatt, and the spelling of the specific name should 
be olivinia and not olivina Horv&th, which is a synonym. (New 
synonymy.) 

Distribution of species: Ethiopian (1), Australian (2). 

Number of species: 3. 

Froggattia Horvdth (1902, p. 604). Homonym of Froggattia Froggatt.

in the original generic description. Laccometopus was erected by 
Fieber to hold L. clavicornis (Linnaeus) and L. kollari Fieber. 
As no type species has heretofore been named, L. clavicornis

Fixation: Present designation. 

Note: This genus is erected to hold rotundata (Herrich-Schaeffer), 
which for many years has been placed as a member of MpTwnthia. 
Suppressing Monanthia as a synonym of Copium and resurrecting 
Dictyla from synonymy (with M. platyoma as the type species) 
make it necessary to erect this new genus to hold rotundata 
(Herrich-Schaeffer). Octacysta, new genus, is separated from 
Dictyla by the eight inflated cysts (hood, each paranotum, hind 
process of pronontum, and two processes on discal part of each 
elytron). 

Description: Head short, very little produced in front of cyos, 
unarmed or provided with two to five spines; bucculae broad, 
areolate, with ends meeting in front, not produced beyond apex 
of clypcus. Labium moderately long; laminae wide, areolate,

short, in very long, iv moderately long. Pronotum tricarinate, 
lateral carinae short; hood rather small, inflated, not projecting 
anteriorly as far as eyes; paranota large, strongly reflexed, con- 
chate, inflated; posterior process inflated. Elytra divided into 
usual areas, with two tumid elevations in each elytron, one at 
middle of and one at apex of boundary separating discoidal and 
sutural areas; discoidal area extending slightly beyond middle of 
elytra in macropterous form, much further beyond in brachyptery.

is inseparable from Acanthia quadrimaculata Wolff (1804, p. 132, 
fig.). As the former name has priority by 10 years, costata is the 
valid name of the species, and thus is the type species of Physa- 
tocheila. New synonymy and new combination.)

Erroneous citation: Monte (1947, p. 19). 

Synonymy: See Tingis. Synonymized by Horvath (1906c, p. 71). 

Note: Fieber (1861, p. 119) used Platychilae (plural form) appar- 
ently to replace the subgenus Phyllontocheild Fieber (1844, p. 59) 
(nomen nudum; sine species). Puton (1879, pp. 106-111) vali- 
dated Platy chila (singular, correct form) as a subgenus of Moman- 
thia by use of key characters and the inclusion of 1 1 species, and 
thus became the author of the subgenus instead of Fieber. Hor- 
vath (1906c, p. 71) suppressed Platy child as a synonym of sub- 
genus Tingis of genus Tingis. See China (1943, p. 247) for history 
and type designation. Lethierry and Severin (1896, p. 18) 
treated Platy chila as a synonym of Lasiacanihia (pro parte). 
Monte (1947, p. 19) erroneously designated Platy chila arnpliata 
Fieber (= Phyllotochild arnpliata Fieber) (sic) as the type species.

Invalid fixation: Monte (1947, p. 21).

Note: Founded as a subgenus of Monanthia. Horvath (1906c, pp. 
79, 84) transferred subgenus Tropidocheila to genus Tingis and 
synonymized Monanthia stachydis Fieber with Tingis maculata 

. (Herrich-Schaeffer). Fieber (1861, p. 130) transferred M. 
maculata to genus Tingis. Oshanin (1912, p. 44) designated 
maculata as the type species of subgenus Tropidocheila. As M. 
stachydis Fieber was one of the originally included species of 
Tropidocheila and a synonym of maculata, the fixation by Oshanin 
is valid. Monte (1947, p. 21) incorrectly designated u Monanthia 
{Tropidocheila) costata (Fabr.) (=Acanthia costata Fabr.)" as 
the type species. It should be noted that costata was wrongly 
determined by Fieber (1844, p. 74) and that the technical name 
is Catoplatus fabricii (Stal). Fieber included an excellent figure

FLIES OF THE FAMILY CONOPIDAE 
FROM EASTERN ASIA 



By Sidney Camras 



This paper is based mainly on specimens in the U.S. National 
Museum, particularly the collections of D. C. Graham in Szechwan, 
and T. D. A. Cockerell in Eastern Siberia. Only a few species of 
Conopidae have been recorded from Szechwan and Western China, but 
the material from better collected areas has yielded many important 
records. It has therefore been deemed worth while to list all the 
specimens examined. 

This study has been especially aided by the interest and courtesy 
of C. W. Sabrosky, U.S. Department of Agriculture, who, besides 
arranging the loans of material, provided information on types in 
the Krober Collection at the U.S. National Museum. Dr. R. 
Kano, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, has been most 
helpful by providing information and copies of Matsumura's works, 
and also some Japanese Conopidae. Dr. C. H. Curran loaned a 
small collection of the American Museum of Natural History with 
some very significant specimens.

108 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Genus Abrachy glossum Krober 

Abrachyglossum Krober, Arch. Naturg., vol. 83, Abt. A, Heft 7, p. 142, 1917. 
Abrachy glossum cockerelli, new species 

Female: Length 10 mm. (without antenna). Head yellow, dark 
brownish at ocellar tubercle and anterior half of front. Velvety- 
black frontofacial mark. Antenna dark brown, dark yellow on 
ventral half of first segment, dark reddish on ventral half of second 
and third segments. Arista black. First antennal segment three 
times as long as wide. Second segment two times length of first. 
Third segment about V/ 2 times length of first. Proboscis black, 
shorter than length of head. Occiput yellow behind vertex and below, 
blackish above at sides. 

Thorax black, faint white pollinose forming a distinct pleural stripe. 
Humeri and distal half of scutellum yellow. Metapleura reddish. 
Coxae black, white pollinose. Legs yellow, blackish in middle of 
femora forming a distinct black mark on dorsal apical half of hind 
femur. Tips of claws black. Wings yellowish hyaline, forming an 
indistinct brownish band between first and third veins and vena 
spuria. Calypters yellow. Halteres yellow, dark brown at base. 

Abdomen black. Pale yellowish distal margin on first, second, 
fifth, and sixth segments. Blackish yellow distal margin on third 
and fourth segments. Yellowish white pollinose band on distal 
margin of second segment and sides of distal margin of first segment. 
Faint white pollinose on sixth and seventh segments. Theca tri- 
angular, about as long as wide. 

Type: Holotype, female, USNM 64475, Kongaus, Siberia, August 
1923, Cockerell. 

This species is similar to A. capitatum, but has black on the femora 
and lacks the yellow pollinose bands on the thud and fourth abdominal 
segments, although the paler areas preceding these bands are present. 
The frontofacial mark is very prominent in the new species, a character 
which has not been mentioned in descriptions of capitatum. In six 
specimens of capitatum examined, this mark is absent in three, faint 
in two, and distinct but not as prominent as in A. cockerelli in one. 

Abrachyglossum wui Ouchi, the only other Abrachyglossum described 
for Asia, is here referred to Siniconops elegans (see below) . 

Genus Conops Linne 

Conops Linne\ Systema naturae, ed. 10, p. 604, 1758. 
Conops vesicularis Linne 

Conops vesicularis Linn6, Fauna Suecica, p. 1903, 1761. 

This widely distributed European species has been previously 
recorded in Asia only from "Siberia." 



CONOPID FLIES — CAMRAS 109 

Material examined: Korea: Suigen, June 3, 1927, T. R. Gardner, 1 
female, USNM. 

Conops Jlavipes Linne 

Conops flavipes Linne, Fauna Suecica, p. 1904, 1761. 

The specimen from Suifu lacks the fourth abdominal tergite, but 
the fourth sternite is present beneath the third tergite. The Szechwan 
specimens have the scutellum mainly yellow, but otherwise the males 
agree with European specimens. 

In the female, the yellow band on the third abdominal segment is 
separated in the center. This suggest Conops licenti Chen, but there 
are some other differences in the description of licenti. 

Conops jozankeanus Matsumura also appears to be very similar, if 
not the same, as this species. 

Material examined: Siberia: Okeanskaya, August 1923, Cockerell, 
1 male, author's collection ex USNM; Smolenschina, Aug. 26, 1927, 
Cockerell, 1 male, USNM. Szechwan: Suifu, alt. 1,000-1,500 ft., 
June 1-21, 1928, D. C. Graham, 1 male, USNM; near Mupin, alt. 
2-8,000 ft., July 1929, D. C. Graham, 1 male, USNM. Manchuria: 
Yalhenya, Pin-chang Province, July 1-10, 1939, M. I. Nikitin, 1 
female, author's collection, ex Steyskal. 

Conops thecoides, new species 

Male: Length 10 mm. Head yellow. Reddish brown vertical 
stripe on front, widening above and below, divided by a yellow 
vertical stripe in the center. Antennal prominence above, and 
most of the facial grooves and keel black. Cheeks reddish posteriorly. 
Vertex and adjacent occiput translucent yellow. Vestigial ocellar 
tubercle present. Side of occiput yellow laterally, blackish centrally. 
Antenna dark reddish brown, more blackish on third segment and 
arista. Moderately long process on second arista! segment. Proboscis 
black, nearly 1% times as long as head. 

Thorax black, faintly yellow pollinose on dorsum. Humeri and 
scutellum entirely bright yellow. Metapleura yellow. Pleura partly 
reddish, no pollinose stripe. Coxae mainly black, partly dark reddish. 
Legs dark yellow, reddish on the femora. Middle third of posterior 
femur diffusely blackish. Apical tarsal segments and tips of claws 
blackish. Calypters bright yellow. Halteres bright yellow, dark 
reddish brown at base. Wings hyaline, with dark brown band from 
costa to fifth vein. Submarginal cell paler apically. Pale mark at 
center of anterior margin of first posterior cell. Discal cell entirely 
dark. 

Abdomen black, indistinctly yellow pollinose. Orange yellow 
band on distal margins of first to fourth segments. This band is 
very narrow on the first segment except at the sides. Sternite 



110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

of fifth segment very large and prominent, resembling a female theca. 
Genitalia dark reddish black. 

Type: Holotype, male, USNM 64476, Uen Chuan, Szechwan, Aug. 
7-14, 1924, D. C. Graham. 

This species belongs to the C. scutellatus group in having the 
scutellum entirely yellow, and, as in scutellatus, the first abdominal 
segment has a narrow yellow distal margin. It differs conspicuously 
from scutellatus by the wing pattern, in addition to the unique fifth 
sternite. 

Conops nigrifrons Krbber 

Conops nigrifrons Krober, Arch. Naturg., vol. 81, Abt. A, Heft. 11, p. 55, 1915. 

Otherwise known only from the type male from Japan. This 
specimen agrees very well with Krober's description, except that the 
cheeks are entirely yellow. 

Material examined: Siberia: Okeanskaya, August 1923, Cockerell, 
1 male, USNM. 

Conops quadrifasciatus DeGeer 

Conops quadrifasciatus DeGeer, Memoires pour servir a l'histoire des insectes, 
vol. 6, p. 104, 1776. 

This widely distributed European species has not been previously 
recorded east of Asia Minor. This specimen has some blackish on 
the femora, a character occasionally possessed by European indi- 
viduals. 

Material Examined: Siberia: Smolenschina, Aug. 26, 1927, Cock- 
erell, 1 male, USNM. 

Subgenus Asiconops Chen 

Asiconops Chen, Notes d'entomologie chinoise, vol. 6, p. 170, 1939. 

This subgenus is characterized by having transverse grooves on 
the front, anterior to the vertex. In a few species the transverse 
grooves of the front are relatively indistinct. In addition I have 
found in the female a tooth-shaped process extending from the 
middle of the posterior margin of the sixth abdominal segment. Most 
of the species have a frontofacial mark. 

This subgenus dominates the Indo-Malayan representatives of the 
genus Conops. 

Type: Conops aureomaculatus Krober. 

Conops (Asiconops) kanoi, new species 

Male: Length 15 mm. Front brownish yellow, with longitudinal 
grooves radiating from the antennal prominence and a few transverse 
grooves in the middle. Vertex and face yellow; most of face and 
posterior orbit gold pollinose. Lower third of facial keel dark brown. 
Occiput black. Antenna dark brown. First segment four times as 



CONOPID FLIES — CAMRAS HI 

long as wide. Second segment nearly twice as long as first. Third 
segment as long as first. Arista yellow at base of apical segment; 
process of second segment small. Proboscis 1% times length of head, 
reddish on distal half. 

Thorax black; dorsum faintly yellow pollinose, more distinct 
medial to the humeri, on metanotum, and on metapleura. Humeri 
dark reddish black. Pleura faintly white pollinose with indistinct 
pleural stripe. Coxae black, partly dark reddish. Femora black, 
rufous dorsally and on apical ventral thud. Remainder of anterior 
and middle legs missing. Posterior tibia rufous. Posterior tarsus 
and tips of claws black. Remainder of claws and pulvilli yellow. 
Wings brownish yellow hyaline, darker between first and third veins 
and vena spuria, and along the fifth vein. Veins mainly black 
apically, yellowish basally. Calypters yellow. Halteres reddish 
yellow, dark reddish at base of stem. 

Abdomen entirely black. Faintly gold pollinose on sides of first 
to third segments and indistinct narrow distal margin of fourth and 
fifth segments. Sixth segment faintly yellowish white pollinose. 

Type: Holotype, male (author's collection), Niijima, Tokyo, Japan, 
Aug. 30, 1953, R. Kano. 

This species is related to C. curtulus but is larger and darker, and 
differs conspicuously by the absence of the distinct abdominal bands. 

Conops (Asiconops) curtulus Coquillett 

Conops curtulus Coquillett, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., vol. 21, p. 328, 1898. 

The type is a female according to Sabrosky. The brown punctures 
on the face and checks are at the insertions of small hairs and are more 
or less distinct in many species of Conops. Conops kuriensis Ouchi 
is very suggestive of this species. 

Material Examined: Japan: Mitsukuri, 1 female paratype, USNM 
4000, with second and third antennal segments missing. 

Conops (Asiconops) tristis Chen 

Conops (A.) tristis Chen, Notes d'entomologie chinoise, vol. 6, p. 180, 1939. 

The specimens listed are referred here although they are not as 
dark as the description of tristis. The face is not largely infuscated 
in these specimens. 

The specimen from Szechwan has more pollen on the abdomen than 
the one from Foochow, but no pale bands of ground color, except 
slightly laterally on apex of fourth segment. 

Material examined: Fukien: Foochow, C. R. Kellogg, 1 female, 
USNM. Szechwan: Mount Omei, 5-11,000 ft., Aug. 24-27, D. C. 
Graham, 1 female, author's collection ex USNM. 



112 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Conops (Asiconops) kulinicus Chen 

Conops (A.) kulinicus Chen, Notes d'entomologie chinoise, vol. 6, p. 180, 1939. 

The specimen examined does not have the sixth abdominal segment 
gold pollinose, but it is rather "worn." The humerus is distinctly 
rufous, rather than a little reddish as described for kulinicus. 

Material examined: Szechwan: Near Mupin, 2-8,000 ft., July 1929, 
D. C. Graham, 1 female, USNM. 

Conops (Asiconops) chinensis, new species

front is predominantly rufous, and the humeri, calli, and apex of 
scutellum are rufous. It agrees with tristis in having an entirely 



CONOPID FLIES — CAMRAS 113 

dark abodmen. It is also apparently related to C. hwangi and C. 
opimus, but these species have a partially reddish abdomen. 

Conops (Asiconops) grahami, new species 

Male: Length 16 mm. Front and occiput brownish yellow. Face 
yellow, gold pollinose except for antenna! prominence. Gold pollinose 
on orbits covering the black frontofacial mark. Spot at center of 
junction of vertex and front gold pollinose. Occiput brownish yellow, 
black centrally. Antenna dark reddish brown, black on second 
segment and on base and apex of arista. Process of second segment 
of arista relatively small. 

Thorax black, humeri and most of scutellum rufous. Thorax 
faintly yellow pollinose, more distinct medial to the humeri, on the 
metanotum, and on the metapleura. Indistinct pollinose pleural 
stripe. Coxae mostly black, anterior coxa partly reddish and gold

Type: Holotype, male, USNM 64477, Uen Chuan Shien, Suifu, 
Szechwan, Aug. 7-14, 1924, D. C. Graham. 

The ptilinum and lower front are inflated, but the specimen is not 
otherwise teneral. 

This species seems related to C. hwangi but has very distinct polli- 
nose abdominal bands. The pollen covering the frontofacial mark 
is a character not noted as yet in any other species. 

Conops (Asiconops) opimus Coquillett 

Conops opimus Coquillett, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., vol. 21, p. 329, 1898. 

The specimen from Japan has a black frontofacial mark as docs the 
type according to Sabrosky. The type is also a female. 

The specimen from Kuliang is more rufous and thus varies toward 
C. rufijrons of Amboina. The specimens from China referred to 
rufijrons by Ouchi may be this form. 

Conops izuoshimensis Ouchi, based on a male, is close to this species 
if not identical. However the wing veins are described as pale 
yellowish for izuoshimensis. Conops flavonervosus Krober also has 



114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

yellow wing veins and is closely related, but has the abdomen mainly 
reddish. 

Material examined: Japan: K. Miyushi, 1 female, USNM (arranged 
as opimus, no type label, slightly grease stained). Fukien: Kuliang, 
1925, H. A. Jaynes, 1 female, USNM.

Conops rufomaculatiis Krober, Arch. Naturg., vol. 81, Abt. A, Heft 11, p. 44, 1915. 

The specimen examined has the dorsum of the thorax black, except 
for the humeri, sides, and scutellum. The first antennal segment is 
dark yellow, although the species was described as having the antenna 
black, third segment dark red brown. 

I do not find any significant differences between this species and 
descriptions of aureomaculatus (=pieli).

Conops (Asiconops) nubeculosus Bigot 

Conops nubeculosus Bigot, Ann. Soc. Ent. France, ser. 7, vol. 6, p. 36, 1887. 

The specimen from Malaya lacks a dorsal stripe as in the variety 
indicus, but has the wing entirely dark as in the variety bigoti (=orna- 
tus). The specimen from the Philippines has three dark dorsal stripes 
and the tibia is white pollinose as in variety bigoti, but the wing is 
normally patterned.

Conops nigriventris Brunetti 

Conops nigriventris Brunetti, in Fauna of British India . . . , Diptera, vol. 3, 
p. 346, 1923. 

This species has previously been known only from the description 
of two males from Assam. 



CONOPID FLIES — CAMRAS 117 

The specimen examined has a slight elevation within a very slightly- 
depressed area on the vertex. Such a change occurs in a few other 
species of Conops (s.s.), and represents a vestigial ocellar tubercle. 
Krober in adding to the description of the type (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist, 
ser. 11, vol. 5, p. 229, 1940), states that there is a distinct ocellar 
swelling (= tubercle) with two ocelli, and because of the spindle shaped 
abdomen, considers this species to be closely related to C. nigripes. 
However, this female shows that it is not at all related to nigripes, 
which belongs to Siniconops. The female has a small triangular 
theca with tip slightly hooked. The robust spindle shape of the 
abdomen is also entirely different from the long cylindrical abdomen 
of the female of nigripes. 

This species is very distinctive structurally by having robust 
bristles on the sides of the dorsum of the thorax, and on the sterno- 
pleura. There is also a prominence of fine bristles on the dorsum of 
the thorax and on the abdomen. 

Material examined: Siam: Chiengmai, Oct. 23, 1920, 1 female,

Genus Siniconops Chen 
Siniconops Chen, Notes d'entomologie chinoise, vol. 6, p. 197, 1939. 

Similar to Conops, but having an ocellar tubercle, usually with two 
ocelli; and usually with a vertical swelling. The third and fourth 
abdominal segments are enlarged in both sexes so that the male 
abdomen is spindle shaped, and the female abdomen is elongated and 
cylindrical. The fifth, sixth, and seventh segments are relatively 
small in the female, but the theca is proportionately large and tooth- 
shaped. 

Type: Sinoconops elegans Chen. 

I am using the term vertical swelling (i.e., swelling of the vertex) 
after Krober, instead of ocellar vesicle as used by Seguy and Chen. 
Since ocellar vesicle is apt to be confused with ocellar swelling which 
Krober and I have used for the ocellar tubercle, it is best to drop both 
of these terms. The ocellar tubercle is the small swelling within the 
ocelli (if present), at the anterior angle of the vertical swelling. The 
vertical swelling may be triangular and distinct from the vertex, or it 
ma} 7 coincide with the vertex. 

In addition to the species recorded here, Physoconops microvalvus 
Krober belongs to this genus, although the base of the abdomen is 
relatively narrow. 

Siniconops maculifrons (Krober) 

Conops maculifrons Krober, Arch. Naturg. vol. 81, Abt. A, Heft 11, p. 41, 1915.

Siniconops philippinensis (Krbber) 

Conops philippinensis Krober, Philippine Journ. Sci., vol. 34, p. 340, 1927. 

The front of the specimen examined is predominantly black, 
although basically the front is yellow with a large black area in the 
center and velvety black laterally and dorsally. The black at the 
lower lateral margin forms a distinct frontofacial mark. These differ- 
ences from the description of the type (male) are within the variation 
seen in Siniconops nigripes and Siniconops microvalvus (formerly 
placed in Physoconops) .

variable amount of hyaline at the base of the wing, but not as much

Physocephala ammophiliformis KrSber 

Physocephala ammophiliformis Krober, Arch. Naturg., vol. 81, Abt. A, Heft 
4, p. 122, 1915. 

There is a variable amount of yellow on the lower lateral part of 
the front, so that the specimen from Mount Omei approaches having 
a black "T" pattern on the front. Another specimen is more reddish, 
with some black at the base of the hind femur, but no black ring. 

Compared with a male and female of P. gigas from Java, which 
Krober thinks may be synonymous, gigas differs by having barely 
a trace of reddish brown on the second abdominal segment. Also 
the legs are darker, but a black ring is distinguishable near the base 
of the hind femur, and the pedicle of the abdomen is more slender 
in gigas. 

Material examined: Szechwan: Shin Kai Si Mount Omei, 3-5,000

The first four specimens listed agree with the original description 
but are smaller, 12-15 mm. The cotype agrees with the description 
of the female, but may represent another species. It is more robust, 
yellow pollinose, and more extensively rufous; and most of the front 
is reddish, not forming a midline.

PhysocepJuila theca, new species 

Female: Length 10 mm. Front, face, and cheeks yellow; blackish 
on apex of vertex, at base of antenna, and in the middle of facial 
grooves. Vertex translucent dark yellow. Occiput black. Posterior 
orbit white pollinose above, yellow pollinose below. Antenna dark 
reddish brown, blackish above. First segment three times as long as 
wide. Second segment three times length of first. Third segment 
nearly one and one half times length of first. Process of proximal 
segment of arista moderate, nearly as long as apical segment of arista. 
Proboscis blackish, reddish in the middle, nearly two times length 
of head. 

Thorax black. Distinct yellow pollinose pleural stripe. Yellow 
pollinose areas present adjacent to humeri, on metathorax and on 
postnotum. Humeri rufous, scutellum entirely black. Coxae dark 
reddish black, partially yellow pollinose. Legs bright rufous, darker 
on apex of posterior tibiae and on tarsi. Claws blackish, pulvilli 
yellow. Wings dark brownish from first to fifth vein. Costal and 
subcostal cells yellowish. Apical half of first basal cell hyaline. 
Apical half of first posterior cell abruptly hyaline. Apical two thirds 
of discal cell hyaline except for posterior margin. Calypters yellow. 
Halteres rufous, dark brownish at base. 

Abdomen mainly black, rufous at junction of second and third 
segments. Dark reddish at base of seventh segment and on the 
theca. Gold pollinose at distal margin of first to fifth segments and 
diffusely on parts of sixth and seventh segments. Theca very large, 
twice as long as wide. Posterior black serrate area slightly longer 
than wide, rufous proximally. 

Male: 9 mm. Similar to the female, but front entirely black. 
Abdomen grease stained, rufous on most of second and third segments 
and at apical half of sixth segment.

A. P. Jacot, author's collection ex USNM. 

This species is very close to P. chrysorrhoea differing by the very 
large theca. There are no good characters for distinguishing the 
male. P. vaginalis of Southern Europe, differs by having the theca 
light reddish brown, and the wing pattern extending only to the 
third vein.

Physocepliala pusilla (Meigen) 

Conops pusilla Meigen, Systematische Beschreibung der bekannten Europ- 
aischen zweifliigeligen Insekten, vol. 4, p. 131, 1824. 

The second specimen listed is questionably referred here because 
it is very dark and there is a trace of an apical spot on the wing. 
However it is too small and slender for P. sinensis. 

Material examined: Shantung: Tsinan, May 27, 1922, A. P. Jacot,

Physocepliala melana, new species 

Female: Length 8 mm. Front and vertex dark yellowish. Black, 
ish in middle of front, and at groove at anterior margin of vertex- 
Face and cheeks yellow. Upper two thirds of facial groove and keel 
black. Occiput black, paler below. Posterior orbit white pol- 
linose. Antenna dark reddish yellow, blacker dorsally. First seg- 
ment two and one half times as long as wide. Second antennal 
segment three times length of first. Third segment one and one half 
times length of first. Process on proximal segment of arista moder- 
ate, as long as apical segment of arista. Proboscis dark, reddish 
in middle, nearly two times length of head.

areas near humeri on metapleura and on postnotum. Humeri and 
narrow margin of posterior calli rufous. Scutellum entirely black. 
Coxae dark reddish brown, yellow pollinose. Legs rufous, darker on 
tarsi. Distal three fifths of posterior femur, except apex, black. 
Claws black, pulvilli yellow. Calypters dark brownish yellow. 
Halteres rufous, dark brown at base. 

Abdomen short and robust, mainly black. Narrow dark reddish 
areas at junction of second and third segments and apical margins 
of third to sixth segments. Faint white pollinose in part, with 
gold pollinose areas on apical margin of third to sixth segments. 
Theca shorter than wide. 

Type: Holotype, female, USNM 64485, Trang Bom, 30 miles 
northwest of Saigon, Cochin China, Aug. 8, 1932, M. Poilane. 

This species is very close to P. limbipennis in coloration, but 
structurally it is quite distinct. The abdomen is relatively short 
and robust, and the theca is very short and wide. This short wide 
abdomen is one of the characters of Pseudophysocephala, but the head 
in this species is normal.

This species does not have any specific color character to dis- 
tinguish it from P. pusilla, as the apical spot on the wing is not always

abdomen is more club shaped, so that the specimens are readily 
separable from pusilla.

Physocephala elongata, new species 

Male: Length 9% mm. Vertex, front, and face dark yellow. 
Blackish in middle at junction of vertex and front. Black on front 
forming an indistinct midline. Black above base of antenna extend- 
ing indistinctly to upper part of face. Large black mark in middle 
of facial grooves including that part of the keel. Occiput 3 T ellowish 
black, paler below. Postorbitals yellowish white pollinose. An- 
tenna nearly blackish on ventral and medial surfaces. First segment 
four times as long as wide. Second segment nearly 2% times the length 
of first. Third segment nearly 1% times length of first. Arista with 
elongated process on proximal segment as long as distal segment. 
Proboscis mainly yellowish, 2% times length of head. Head nearly 
twice as high as long. Shiny triangular area at posterior margin of 
eye large and prominent. 

Thorax dull black. Humeri and parts of pleura dark yellow. 
Yellow white pollinose pleural stripe, and pollinose area medial to 
humeri and on postnotum. Coxae reddish black, white pollinose. 
Legs dark yellow. Blackish above on femora, forming an indistinct 
subbasal ring. Tarsi darker. Pulvilli and claws, except black tips, 
dark yellow. Wing with dark pattern from costa to third vein 
extending to apex. Basal half of first posterior cell dark, remainder

abruptly hyaline. Dark margin along sixth vein. Calypters dark 
yellowish brown. Halteres bright yellow, blackish at base. 

Abdomen black. Second segment and basal half of third segment 
dark 3^ellowish. Narrow distal margin on third, fourth, and fifth 
segments dark reddish yellow. Apical half of sixth segment and 
genitalia mainly dark reddish yellow. Pedicle of abdomen longer 
than club of abdomen. 

Type: Holotype, male, USNM 64486, Ulu Gombak, Selangor, 
Malaya, Dec. 25, 1947, W. H. Lange. 

This species is very close to P. bipartita in coloration, the differences 
being mainly structural. The abdomen is relatively long and slender 
and the head is relatively short (flattened), with a large triangular 
polished area on the posterior margin of the eye. The head charac- 
ters are that of Pseudophysocephala, and Krober did include one 
species with an elongated (instead of short) abdomen. However, the 
new species Physocephala melana is an intergrade, and there are 
species with a rounded head but large triangular eye area; so that at 
present I do not believe that Pseudophysocephala can be maintained. 

Physocephala pielina Chen 

Physocephala pielina Chen, Notes d'entomologie chinoise, vol. 6, p. 190, 1939.

In describing sinensis, Chen apparently misinterpreted Krober's 
use of the term "wulst." Myopa buccata does not have any spots on 
the face, but does have some on the occipital swelling behind the face. 
As in the previous species, European specimens average darker with 
more contrast between light and dark areas.

Sicus abdominalis Krober 

Sicus ferrugineus var. abdominalis Krober, Arch. Naturg., vol. 81, Abt. A, Heft 1, 
p. 88, 1915. 

This species differs from S. ferrugineus by having a shorter and 
wider abdomen, and by having a larger distinct theca in the female. 
I feel certain that Krober's type is a specimen having the abdomen 
flexed so that difference of the theca horn ferrugineus is not apparent. 

The illustrations by Ouchi (Journ. Shanghai Sci. Inst., sec. 3, 
vol. 4 (1939), p. 211, 1940) show the differences between this and 
the other species. This species is shown as S. fusenensis var. a and 
var. b. The difference between variety a and b is simply that in 
variety a the abdomen is extended, and in variety b the abdomen 
is flexed. 

In this species, when viewed from above, the second abdominal 
segment is as long or somewhat longer than wide, and the third 
abdominal segment is wider than long. In ferrugineus, the second 
abdominal segment is much longer than wide, and the third abdominal 
segment is as long or longer than wide. In the female sex the abdomen 
is even more elongated in ferrugineus, and the differences between the 
two species are greater. 

The series from Szechwan differs from the specimens from Siberia 
and Manchuria by averaging smaller, and by being paler and more 
pollinose. Also the latter have a pair of curved black marks on the 
second abdominal segment. These black marks, however, are present 
or absent in my series of ferrugineus from Europe, which includes a 
very dark male with the femora predominantly blackish. 

Occemyia ogumae Matsumura (Thousand insects of Japan, Addit- 
amenta 2, p. 273, 1916) may be this species. The illustration shows 
the black marks on the second abdominal segment.

This species is similar to S. abdominalis in the shape of the abdomen, 
but differs in being predominantly dark, particularly on the dorsum 
of the thorax and second abdominal segment. While it might be 
considered a dark form of abdominalis, there are no intermediates in 
this series, and both occur at Kongaus. 

Occemyia nishitapensis Matsumura (Thousand insects of Japan,

This species is otherwise known only from the type female from 
Northern Korea. It is very similar to S. jerrugineus, and although 
I the abdomen is not quite as elongated as jerrugineus, the third ab- 
dominal segment is much longer than wide. 

The male is unknown, but will probably prove to be very similar 
to, if not indistinguishable from the male of jerrugineus. I have not 
seen any specimens of jerrugineus from Asia, and it is possible that 
such records may belong to jusenensis.

Each of the specimens examined differ from each other and from 
the typical European form. However additional material would be 
necessary to decide if any of these should be named. 

The specimen from Siberia has more yellow on the anterior femora 
than the typical form, but this condition is matched by one or two 
specimens of a series from Cyprus in my collection. 

The specimen from Yangchow has the pollen yellowish gray and 
the femora mainly yellowish and thus approaches T. sauteri of Formosa. 
However, it is paler than sauteri having the antennae and front mainly 
yellowish, and the wings are also yellowish. One of the two cotype 
males of sauteri sent by USNM for comparison has the abdominal 
pollen more grayish than yellowish. 

The specimen from Szechwan has all of the femora almost entirely 
yellow, and the antennae are mainly yellowish. 

This species has not been previously recorded from Siberia.

Thecophora philippinensis, new species 

Male: Length 4 mm. Vertex and front black. Narrow margin 
above base of antennae dark reddish. Face and facial grooves 
reddish-yellow. Posterior half of cheeks blackish. Occiput black. 
Antennae reddish-yellow, black on lateral surface and distal half of 
medial surface of third segment. Arista black. First segment as 
long as wide. Second segment four times length of first. Third 
segment 2% times length of first. Proboscis missing beyond palpi. 

Thorax black, with faint white pollinose areas leaving three indis- 
tinct black lines on dorsum. Legs black, basal two-fifths of posterior 
femur yellow. Base of tibiae, basal tarsi, pulvilli, and claws except 
black tips yellow. Wings hyaline. Calypters brownish. Halteres 
bright yellow, blackish at base. 

Abdomen black, relatively distinct grayish yellow pollinose distal 
band on second, third, fourth, and fifth segments. Sixth segment 
indistinctly grayish yellow pollinose. Fifth sternite very prominent, 
resembling a theca. 

Variation (in paratype): Length 4% mm. No black on cheeks. 
Antennal proportions 1:3:2. Each of distal segments of proboscis 
about equal to length of head. Theca less prominent (abdomen 
flexed).

are mainly black, the basal two-fifths of the hind femur is yellow. 

Thecophora simillima (de Meijere) (Bijdr. tot de Dierkunde, vol. 18,

FIREFLIES OF THE GENUS PYRACTONEMA 
(COLEOPTERA: LAMPYRIDAE) 



By Frank A. McDermott 



Introduction 



Solier (1849) described nine new species of Lampyridae from Chile 
and placed them in a new genus, Pyractonema. Fairmaire and 
Germain (1862) described as Lucidota three new species that were 
subsequently removed to Pyractonema, and Gemminger and Harold 
(1869) changed the specific trivial name of Solier 's P. compressi- 
cornis to depressicornis, the former being preoccupied in Lucidota. 
The first species referred to in the literature belonging in this genus 
is P. obscura (G. A. Olivier, 1790) from Tierra del Fuego. To this 
species E. Olivier (1907, 1910) referred four of Solier's species and 
also two others; P. bardelli (le Guillou, 1844) and P. bioculata 
(Blanchard, 1853.) He also referred Solier's P. rhododera to this 
species, but rhododera is herein reestablished as a valid species. 
Since E. Olivier (1907, p. 6) had access to the collections of his grand- 
father, G. A. Olivier, and of Fairmaire (although he remarks, p. 62, 
that the latter is in "inextricable disorder"), it must be assumed that 
he made the comparisons necessary to convince him of this synonymy. 
Thus, of the 15 described species, E. Olivier (1907, 1910) recognized 
only 9. No other species definitely referrable to this genus appears 
to have been described since those of Fairmaire and Germain. 
E. Olivier (1902) described three Japanese species but subsequently 
transferred them to Lucidina.

134 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM 

It is noted that E. Olivier's (1907) generic description does not 
entirely agree with Solier's. Nor do the latter's descriptions of the 
species exactly meet his generic characters, a condition which my 
examination of the specimens at hand confirms. 

Barber (1951, p. 16) designated P. depressicornis Gemminger 
(compressicornis Solier) as the type species. From the standpoint 
of being typical of the genus, this species, with wide pale elytral 
borders, is perhaps less satisfactory than say, P. obscura, although 
it is the first in Solier's descriptions. 

POSITION OF PYRACTONEMA AMONG THE LAMPYRIDAE 

E. Olivier (1907, 1910) placed Pyractonema in his subfamily 
Lucidotinae. As was noted above, Fairmaire and Germain called 
their species Lucidota, and there is, indeed, very little in the published 
descriptions to differentiate Pyractonema from many of the species 
commonly called Lucidota, the principal difference being the very de- 
pressed body of most species of Pyractonema. However, the large 
genus Lucidota, with over 100 species, is obviously composite and 
probably includes a considerable number that are properly Ellychnia 
and Pyropyga. 

As was also mentioned, E. Olivier (1902) originally described three 
Japanese species as Pyractonema but subsequently removed them to 
Lucidina (Gorham, 1883). The chief distinguishing character of 
the latter genus is the deeply cleft tarsal claw resulting in a 3-clawed 
appearance, but in the writer's experience this condition is not con- 
stant in all claws of species of Lucidina. Occasional specimens of 
Chilean Pyractonema have some claws so divided. Thus, aside from 
the widely different geographic distribution, only the described long, 
apically attenuate pronotum of Lucidina distinguishes it from 
Pyractonema. 

SOURCES OF MATERIAL STUDIED 

I received from Luis E. Peiia, of Santiago, Chile, a large series of 
Chilean lampyrids, the majority being of the P. nigripennis group, 
which must be very abundant, together with several larvae of at 
least two types. A rather striking feature of this collection is the 
great general similarity of the species, although they range from 5 to 
24 mm. long. A few specimens of Chilean cantharids also resemble 
the lampyrids in their black elytra and reddish or black-striped red 
pronota. Apparently the adults are not appreciably luminous, if at 
all so, and the majority seem to be diurnal. If present, the luminous 
organs are rudimentary, frequently merely minute pale scales, or 
sometimes distinct red spots, occasionally centrally yellow, on the 8th 
ventral segment, where the residual larval luminous organs are situ- 
ated in other lampyrids. Although Pena states that he has never 



FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 135 

seen a luminous firefly in Chile, he mentioned that one species, P. 
depressicornis, was only taken after sunset. In this species, the male 
has luminous organs nearly as large as in some species of Diphotus, 
though in the two females seen, these organs were very small. 

Most of the specimens were collected in December, January, and 
February at altitudes from 600 to 1,700 meters, and between latitudes 
33° and 38° S. A few were collected at lower levels and some on the 
island of Chiloe at latitude 42° S. For most of the species there is 
no evidence of restriction to a given locality or altitude, although P. 
angustata was collected only at relatively high stations. One speci- 
men of P. depressicornis was taken at Nogueche and one at Concep- 
ci6n. All the others were from Pellehue and Tregualemo. 

Subsequent to the examination of the material received from Pefia, 
an opportunity was provided by J. W. Green of the California Aca- 
demy of Sciences to examine 482 specimens of nonluminous South 
American Lampyridae, mostly Pyractonema from Chile, in the Reed 
Collections. For the most part, these specimens presented nothing 
not covered by Pefia's specimens, except for the collecting stations. 
Among 108 specimens of P. haemorrhoa, there were a few which were 
intermediate between the large and smaller forms in Pena's shipment; 
one male of this species was distinctly brown and another was par- 
tially so; in several specimens the terminal abdominal segment was 
yellow instead of red, and in three the color was absent. A few speci- 
mens in the nigripennis group had yellow instead of red pronotal 
coloration; all brachelytral specimens were females. One small, 
brown, female specimen with a yellow pronotum looked rather clearly 
different from any other, and was identified as P. vicina Solier. A 
description prepared from this specimen and two males in the U.S. 
National Museum has been included with the other descriptions. 

The specimens of P. rhododera in the California collection ranged 
from 3.5 to nearly 12 mm. long, measurements that agree with Solier's 
range. If a sharp segregation on length were possible, it would seem 
that two species are included under this name, but some were inter- 
mediate, and it seems unwise to make an arbitrary division on this 
basis, as is done in the nigripennis group, for a relatively scarcer 
species. Specimens 3.5 to 8 mm. long were collected at the same sta- 
tion and about three weeks apart. Two pairs (taken in copulation) 
were both of the small form. 

A later shipment of Chilean insects received from Pefia contained 
several specimens of a species of Pyractonema different from any pre- 
viously described, particularly in their small size and the shape of the 
pronotum, which is markedly long in proportion to the width and 
widest at apical tliird. Because of their fragility and small size, they 
proved difficult to handle. The description is based on 6 males and 



136 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM 

5 females. There were three pairs in copulation, and all were from 
the same locality. As in most other species of the genus, they are 
without developed luminous organs. Also in common with other 
species, the elytra of the females vary considerably in relative length, 
and from 1 to 3 abdominal segments are exposed. While occasional 
small specimens of P. obscura, P. albomarginata, and P. rhododera 
approach the length of this species, here named P. minor, these spe- 
cimens may be distinguished by the specific characters. The holo- 
type, female allotype, and five paratypes have been sent to Pena. 

AEDEAQI 

The aedeagi were extracted after they were relaxed in a moist 
chamber, dried in acetone a few minutes, and immediately mounted 
on Nylon filaments with Duco cement. The base of the filament was 
cemented to a point, which was then pinned like a specimen. Meas- 
urements were made on the mounted aedeagus, and outline drawings 
were made with a camera lucida. 

Comparisons of the aedeagi revealed that by simple inspection of 
the specimens, P. bifenestrata could not be definitely separated from 
P. obscura. Small specimens provisionally classed as the former 
sometimes showed the aedeagus characteristic of the latter, and vice 
versa. Except for the aedeagus of bifenestrata, there is some general 
resemblance in this organ among the various species. In P. nigri- 
pennis and P. depressicornis, the lateral lobes were usually more or 
less spread as shown in the drawings. Since some of the species were 
originally described as Lucidota, it seemed worthwhile to compare 
the aedeagus of Lucidota atra, which, like Pyractonema, is diurnal and 
nonluminous, with those of the latter genus. The long, narrow struc- 
ture of this organ in atra, however, is not comparable to that of any 
of the species of Pyractonema except possibly bifenestrata, and it lacks 
the broad cultriform median lobe of the latter. Somewhat surprising 
is the fact that the aedeagus of bifenestrata should be noticeably 
different from those of its congeners. The aedeagus of Lucidina 
puerile E. Olivier, from Japan, is similar in form to that of P. bifene- 
strata, but the median lobe is not cultriform and the lateral lobes have 
expanded apical portions. 

The outline drawings which I have included are intended as aids in 
identification ; however, I do not attempt to indicate internal structure 
or function of parts. 

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON VARIANTS AND LARVAE 

A few specimens, all males and mostly from Parral, did not quite 
meet the descriptions of the species given herein. Examination of the 
aedeagi showed them to be much like that of P. bifenestrata, and these 



FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 137 

specimens therefore probably represent some local variant of that 
species, although because of the much reduced pronotal infuscation, 
they are superficially more like a larger P. latior. 

The almost startling similarity, especially in the pronotal appear- 
ance, of many of the species has been noted, and applies particularly 
to the nigripennis group, and also to depressicornis and haemorrhoa. 
Structurally as well as in coloration, most of the members of the genus 
are quite similar, which may be taken to indicate relatively recent 
speciation. The adaptation of P. obscura to the seemingly unfavor- 
able habitat (from the lampyrid standpoint) of Tierra del Fuego, 
latitude 55° S., is interesting; Lampyris noctiluca in England and 
Europe is at about a corresponding latitude north but in a more 
favorable climate. 

In the course of the work, it was noted that the odor of the collection, 
especially of the nigripennis group, was very similar to that of collec- 
tions of the North American Photinus pyralis, though rather more 
pronounced. Alcoholic extracts of the specimens of this genus did 
not develop a blue fluorescence as do similar extracts of Photinus. 

While nothing definite is known about the life history of Pyractonema 
or their habits, the mouth parts are complete, and it may be that the 
adults feed occasionally, probably on other insects, as is the case in 
Photuris and Photinus. More probably, most of the feeding is done 
in the larval stage as is usual among lampyrids, the principal food 
probably being snails (Pefia). One specimen bore a minute tick. 

The larvae in the collection do not differ materially in superficial 
appearance from those of North American lampyrids. The largest 
were 18.35 and 19.65 mm. long by 5.1 and 4.3 mm. broad at the meso- 
notal and metanotal segments, and taper posteriorly. The pro- 
notum of the smaller of the larvae was but little narrowed in front 
and the head was unusually large with very long, slender, tapering 
mandibles, the distance across the bases of the latter being over 
1.5 mm. The legs and antennae were also unusually long for a 
lampyrid larva. It was brown with yellow lateral borders on all the 
segments, and the abdominal segments have subtriangular laterally 
projecting plates, all of which present a serrate appearance. The 
larger larva was practically black, granulose, and had posterolateral 
angles on all segments which were yellow to a rather bright salmon- 
pink. The head was much smaller than in the smaller larva, black, 
cylindrical, and bore a pair of short mandibles slightly curved up- 
wards. Both larvae had a pair of luminous organs, apparently func- 
tional, on the lateral thirds of the 8th abdominal segment. I concluded 
(1956) that the latter one represents a juvenile state of the giant glow 
worms found in South America. 



138 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM 

Another larva was 15 mm. long, and uniformly 3 mm. broad from 
the second thoracic to the 6th abdominal segment. The head was 
small, the antennae relatively long, and the coxal cavities long, narrow, 
pointed distally and white basally. The dorsal surface above the 
luminous organs was translucent, the light evidently being visible from 
above. Except for the structure of the terminal abdominal segment, 
this larva might have been thought to be a larviform female. 

The spiracles on all of these larvae were on the ventral surface of 
the lateral lobes of the abdominal segments. In the absence of rearing 
tests, it is usually impossible to say what species a given larvae 
represents and no attempt can be made to do so with these glow worms. 

The advice of J. W. Green, T. J. Spilman, and C. W. Sabrosky is 
acknowledged with appreciation. 

Genus Pyractonema Solier 

Pyractonema Solier in Gay, Hist. Fis. Pol. Chile, vol. 4, Zool. pp. 445 ff., 1849. 

Diagnosis: Pyractonema is a genus of nearly or entirely nonlumi- 
nous lampyrids at present known only from Chile and adjacent parts 
of Argentina and possibly extending up the slopes of the Andes to 
Bolivia and Peru. The possibility that Lucidina should be included 
is at present ruled out. Before giving the key to the species, and their 
descriptions, it may be well to call attention to some points of general 
similarity which are not always repeated in the individual descrip- 
tions, and to some of the intraspecific variations which have been 
noted. 

The body is noticeably dorsoventrally compressed in most species, 
sometimes so much so as to seem to leave little space for internal 
organs. While this condition may be an artifact in closely packed 
specimens, it appears to be a natural feature in this genus. 

The pronotum is usually semicircular or semielliptical, frequently 
slightly prolonged apically, usually distinctly wider than long and 
frequently markedly so in females. The base may be nearly straight 
between the angles, slightly emarginate, or sinuate. The postero- 
lateral angles may be posteriorly produced, salient to the lateral edges, 
or merely rounded. There may be a median, narrow, longitudinal 
channel or a relatively wide sulcus, or even a fine carina usually con- 
fined to the basal half or two-thirds. The lateral margins are usually 
reflexed, and the apical margin is slightly reflexed in most specimens. 
The disk is usually smooth or very finely punctulate, while the re- 
mainder of the surface is coarsely punctate, with a submarginal row 
of large punctures. The scutellum is asymmetrically diamond- 
shaped, the basal point being obtuse, and the apical half being longer 
with a rounded apex. The scutellum is dark brown or black, and 
usually hairy. The mesonotal plates are usually dull black. The 



FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 139 

elytra appear black in the closed position over the wings, but are a 
somewhat translucent dark brown by transmitted light; in all species 
they are finely and densely granulose. Costae usually number two 
or three but are often indistinct and frequently evanescent apically; 
explanate margins are generally narrow, except in the smaller variety 
of P. haemorrhoa. 

The head and eyes are relatively rather small as compared with 
those of the luminous lampyrids. The frons is black or dark brown, 
and in some species appears to project bulbously between the antennal 
sockets. The mandibles are brown, approximately circularly curved. 
The maxillary palpi are black or dark brown, with a terminal article 
of conoidal outline flattened on the inside, and are rather large. The 
labial palpi are relatively small, brown, and modified securiform. The 
clypeus is not connate with the front, is short, black, or dark brown, 
and is usually semicircular, but it may be sinuate or even tridentate. 
The labrum may project forward of the clypeus as a white, membran- 
ous area. 

The presternum is usually almost entirely pink, as is most of the 
mesosternum. The metasternum is entirely black. Except in P. 
haemorrhoa, the abdominal segments are all black or dark brown, 
though the pygidium may be partly translucent. The "dentate" 
abdominal structure mentioned in the older descriptions refers to the 
posteriorly projecting lateral lobes on tergites 5, 6, and 7. 

The legs are all black, although their vestiture may be brown. 
Claws are usually entire, rarely cleft, and sometimes with a short 
basal spur. Tibial spurs are very small, frequently indistinguishable 
at 30 X magnification. 

The antennae are of the same general type in all of the species. 
Articles number 11, of which 1 is club shaped, 2 is short and conical, 
and 3-10 are usually wide and much compressed, this widening being 
much more pronounced in some species than in others. Articles 4 to 
1 1 are attached at their bases to the outer edge of the apex of the pre- 
ceding article, and thus give a somewhat serrate appearance, which 
is most pronounced in P. depressicornis. The terminal article is nar- 
rowly elliptical, and 4 to 1 1 are more or less hairy. In the males, the 
antennae are usually somewhat more than one-half the total length 
(pronotum plus elytra), and less than one-half in the females. 

Remarks: From my work on this genus, it appears that the fol- 
lowing species are valid: albomarginata, bifenestrata, depressicornis, 
haemorrhoa, nigripennis, obscura, rhododera, subulipennis (not seen), 
vicina, and the new species, angustata, latior, and minor. 

On the basis of the comments of Ferris (192.8), it has seemed worth- 
while to redescribe the known species recognized in the material stud- 
ied. The descriptions of new species and redescriptions of old species

slightly wider in the females. Approximately semicircular in outline, 
slightly prominent apically. 

Scutellum and mesonotal plates black. 

Elytra black, usually tricostate. Explanate margins narrow. 
About 0.75 to 0.8 of total length. In the male, the elytra are at least 
as long as the abdomen. In the female, segment 8 and sometimes 7 
are exposed. 

Head black, not markedly bulbous between the antennal sockets. 
Ctypeus short, black, semicircular. 

Antennae black, compressed. Articles 4, 5, and 6 may be widest, 
but usually 4 to 10 subequal. About 0.5 to 0.6 of body length in males, 
0.4 to 0.5 in females. 

Tergites all black, except that the red last ventral segment shows 
through the pygidium; the latter medially emarginate, longer, and 
nearly as wide as segment 7 in male, triangular in female. 

Ventral segments 2 to 7 black, 8 almost entirely red, rarely yellow 
or white, but may have a black apical margin or lateral angles. Me- 
dially emarginate in male. A prominent "pore" on each rudimentary 
luminous organ. In female, segment 8 triangular, apically V-notched. 

Legs black, compressed. Tibial spurs very inconspicuous. Claws 
not spurred, but may have a short "thumb" at base.

FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 147 

Atypical form : The 20 shorter specimens differ mainly in dimen- 
sions from the typical form, and naming them even as a variety does 
not seem justified. 

General: Resembling the typical form, but shorter and propor- 
tionately broader, outline elliptical, with relatively wide explanate 
elytral margins. 

Dimensions: Males 10.0 to 12.9 mm. long by 4.1 to 4.6 mm. broad; 
average 11.6 by 4.4 mm. Females 12.0 to 14.8 mm. long by 3.0 to 
5.9 mm. broad; average 13.5 mm. by 5.3 mm. 

Pronotum as in the typical form. Average length 0.67 of width in 
male, 0.69 in female. 

Elytra 0.7 of body length in males, 0.77 in females. 

Antennae tend to be relatively shorter than in the typical form, 
about 0.44 of body length. 

Two of the males had no black on the pronotum, and another had 
only a brown spot in the apical fourth and a streak along the basal 
margin. One had a very narrow black border and an incomplete 
median vitta. In one specimen, the scutellum and mcsonotal plates 
were pinkish brown. In all specimens, the latter were unusually 
wide. Two females had incomplete median vittae, and in one of 
these the black borders were also incomplete, and were very narrow in 
two specimens. In one male, the pygidium was largely black instead 
of the usual pink with black lateral and apical borders. 

Elytral explanate margins conspicuously wider than in the typical 
form, usually widest at basal fourth. 

The shorter body and elliptical outline suggest that this variant 
may have been the basis for the original description of the species. 

P. haemorrhoa is apparently a clearly distinct species, and it is odd 
that Solier failed to mention the characteristic red terminal abdominal 
segments in any of his descriptions. About 180 specimens were among 
the material received from Pefia, all of which were longer than Fair- 
maire's length of 10 mm., and 20 of which were of a smaller and 
proportionately broader form. The collection of the California 
Academy of Sciences contained specimens intermediate between these 
two forms.

tudinal vitta, and a narrow brown to black pronotal border, usually 
incomplete anterolateral^. Distinguishable from P. angustata by its 
broader, more elliptical outline and pronotal infuscation. 

Dimensions: Males 7.4 to 12.3 mm. long by 2.55 to 4.3 mm. broad; 
average 9.45 by 3.33 mm. Females 7.1 to 10.0 mm. long by 2.55 to 
4.05 mm. broad; average 8.45 by 3.1 mm. 

Pronotum disc with subrectangular, transverse, red to pink area 
occupying half or more of the total surface of the pronotum. This 
area is usually at least partly divided by a narrow triangular brown 
to black vitta, the point basad. Narrow brown to black basal and 
lateral borders, the latter usually evanescent at apical two-thuds, 



FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 149 

but occasionally completing a narrow border around the apex. This 
border and/or the median vitta may be absent, but in these cases 
there is an indistinct triangular infuscation in the apical half. Re- 
mainder of pronotum transparent or at least translucent colorless to 
yellowish. Lateral edges reflexcd, apically little if at all so. 

Scutellum and mesonotal plates black to dark brown. 

Elytra subparallel, giving a narrowly elliptical outline. Black. 
Explanate margins narrow, about one-sixth of elytral width. 

Frons black. Not markedly bulbous between the antennae. 

Antennae about half of body length in both sexes. Narrower than 
in the P. nigripennis group and appear only slightly serrate. 

Tergites all dark brown to black. Pygidium in male may be truncate, 
bidentate, or tridentate, or sinuate: in female, tapering to a broadly 
rounded apex. Posterolateral pointed lobes on 5, 6, and 7 less de- 
veloped in the female. 

Ventral segments all dark brown to black. Sometimes with narrow 
black apical borders. Rudimentary luminous organs usually absent, 
sometimes represented by pale spots. 

Legs black. Tibial spurs very small, pattern apparently 0-1-1. 
Claws simple. 

Aedeagus as in figure 6.

Dimensions: Males 3.5 to 5.1 mm. long by 1.0 to 1.65 mm. broad. 
Females 4.25 to 5.5 mm. long by 1.15 to 1.65 mm. broad. 

Pronotum: Conspicuously nearly as long as broad, widest at apical 
third, narrowing slightly to base; angles obtuse. Apical and lateral 
borders black, with submarginal punctures. Basal two-thirds orange- 
red (yellow in one specimen). Apical third transparent back of black 
border. Disc flat and smooth. No median vitta. 

Scutellum and mesonotal plates black. 

Elytra black, parallel, rngose. Very narrow explanate margins 
which may appear paler than the disc. About 0.8 of total length in 
males, shorter in females, in which 1 to 3 abdominal segments may be 
exposed. 

Body completely black. Thin and flat in horizontal plane. No 
indication of luminous organs. Pygidium trilobed. 

Head black. Mouth parts very small and of same character as in 
other species.

to 11 narrowing slightly progressively. In males about 0.55 of body 
length, in females about 0.45. 

Legs black, compressed. Claws simple. 

There are two specimens of this species, labeled "Chile" and 
"E. C. Reed" in the collection of the U.S. National Museum. 

Pyractonema nigripennis group 

(nigripennis, bifenestrata , obscura) 

Of the several hundred specimens received from Pefia, a series of 340 
males selected without reference to the collecting station were mounted 
and measured. They furnished a complete series at 0.25 mm. inter- 
vals from 5 to 19 mm. long. Two more were 19.5 mm. In 147 females, 
a nearly complete series from 6 to 22 mm. long was obtained, two 
more being 24 mm. long. Plotting the number of male specimens 
falling in each 0.25 mm. group showed principal maxima at 9.5, 12.5, 
and 17 mm. lengths, and secondary maxima at 7 and 14 mm. The 
females distributed somewhat similarly, but less definitely. There 
were several pairs in copulation, and in each case the components 
were of approximately the same size. 

On the basis of total length, it is possible to consider those from 
15 to 19.5 mm. long (to 24 mm. in females,) as nigripennis: those 11 
to 15 mm. long as bifenestrata; and those less than 11 mm. long as 
obscura. This designation is arbitrary, of course, and involves some 
overlapping between the species. Alternatively one must consider 
that they all represent a single species highly variable in size. Olivier's 
(1907) illustration of nigripennis gives a scale length of 14.75 mm., 
and it might therefore be either nigripennis or bifenestrata by the 
separation on total length proposed above. Collections made at the 
same station and time frequently contained specimens of several 
sizes. Study of the aedeagi showed that nigripennis , bifenestrata, and 
obscura exhibited different patterns. 

In the initial separation of the specimens in this group, one series 
was picked out by their relatively small and narrow pronota. These 
specimens also proved to be intermediate in total length between the 
larger specimens here called P. nigripennis, and the smaller P. obscura, 
and constitute the majority of the specimens here classed as P. 
bifenestrata. 

All of the specimens with short elytra, exposing up to 4 abdominal 
segments, were females, and it seems probable that P. brevipennis is 
a brachelytral form of the female in this group. The shortest elytra 
were usually found in the largest specimens, but all gradations from 
1 to 4 abdominal segments exposed were noted. 

In the original descriptions there is no essential difference other 
than size between P. nigripennis, P. bifenestrata, P. binoiata, P. 



FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 151 

lugubris, and P. obscura. P. bardelli and P. bioculata are described 
as brown, not black, and P. brevipennis differs only in the short elytra. 
In nigripennis the thoracic coloration is described as yellow, but 
Olivier's (1907) illustration shows it as red. One specimen in Pefia's 
collection had yellow instead of red, as did some of those in the Cali- 
fornia collection, while one specimen of P. vicina, as noted, had red 
instead of yellow. Apparently yellow and red colorations are alterna- 
tive in this genus. P . fissicollis may be dismissed as an abnormality, 
as noted by Olivier (1899). There were several hundred specimens 
representing this group in the material sent to me by Pena, the speci- 
mens ranging from 5 to 19.5 mm. long in the males and up to 24 mm. 
in the females. What bearing this situation has on taxonomy is 
discussed under the species descriptions. 

In view of the great superficial similarity of the specimens (or 
species) in this group in characters other than size, a general 
description is given below that will apply to all; under the three 
species are given the dimensions of the admittedly arbitrary divisions 
for each. The smaller specimens appeared to be somewhat broader 
proportionately than the larger ones, a difference confirmed by the 
final measurements. 

Pronotum with wide lateral and apical, narrow basal borders, 
and wide median longitudinal vitta black. Portions of apical edge in 
front of eyes may be brown. Disc with two subrectangular or 
reniform red areas (rarely yellow), the color not being particularly 
brilliant. The median vitta is broader in the females than in males 
and in P. nigripennis usually has an urn-shaped outline. The red 
area comprises 0.3 to 0.5 of the total surface. Basal edge usually 
sinuate, angles various. Lateral edges deeply and apical margin 
usually slightly reflexed. A depression just forward of each red spot. 
Shallow sulcus, frequently wide, in basal half or third. 

Scutellum black. Mesonotal plates black to very dark brown. 

Elytra black, tricostate in larger specimens, the costae becoming 
less pronounced in the smaller specimens. Explanate margins very 
narrow, about one-seventh or less of the elytral width In males longer 
than the abdomen or ending with it; in females usually exposing 
1 to 4 abdominal segments. Elliptical outline. 

Head with frons black, usually projecting more or less bulbously 
between the antennal sockets. Eyes relatively small, the distance 
across them being about 0.55 to 0.6 of the pronotal width. Clypeus 
short, black, hairy, semicircular, or medially cmarginate. 

Antennae black, compressed. Articles 3 to 10 subrectangular, base 
about 0.6 of apical width. Base of 4 to 11 attached near to the 
outer apical corner of the preceding article in the males, the point of 
attachment being more nearly median in the females. Vestiture 



152 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM 

short, black or dark brown, especially noticeable on the edges. Arti- 
cles 5 to 8 generally the widest, 9 and 10 narrower, and 11 elliptical. 
Article 3 shorter than succeeding articles. Length usually 0.5 to 0.6 
of the total length in males, about 0.4 in females. 

Tergites all black to dark brown, except pygidium, which in males 
may be partly translucent, apically truncate, sinuate, emarginate, or 
distinctly tridentate, projecting widely laterally and apically over 
ventral segment 8. Pygidium triangular in female. 5 to 7 have 
posterolateral pointed lobes. 

Ventral segments all black or dark brown, except for yellowish or 
pinkish rudimentary luminous organs on 8. These organs are occa- 
sionally not observable in the larger specimens and are usually absent 
in the smaller ones and females. In males, segment 8 is somewhat 
emarginate with a short median point. In the females, this segment 
is triangular with a deep apical V-shaped notch. 

Legs all black or brown, somewhat compressed. Tibial spurs very 
small and short, pattern 0-1-1. Claws simple, but may have a basal 
enlargement. 

There seems to be an error in Solier's measurement of the width of 
P. binotata (—P. obscura). The size is given as 3 to S l A lines (6.35 
to 7.4 mm.) long by 3% lines (6.88 mm.) broad, a measurement which 
hardly seems possible. Even 2% lines (4.77 mm.) would be too broad 
for any specimens I have seen which could be referred to this species. 
It seems probable that P. binotata was erected on the basis of an 
unusually broad specimen of P. obscura. 

Of the remaining species previously described and now listed under 
P. obscura, P. bardelli and P. bioculata were probably pale or imma- 
ture specimens of P. obscura: E. Olivier's grouping of them and 
P. lugubris as synonyms of P. obscura seems justified.

FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 153 

P. nigripennis is described as having a maximum length of 17% 
lines (37.1 mm.). This measurement should probably read 7% lines 
(15.9 mm.), although it is less than many of the specimens seen. 

There seem to be several misprints of dimensions in Solier's descrip- 
tions. P. brevipennis is described as 5% lines (12 mm.) long by 4% 
lines (9.0 mm.) broad. The latter figure is probably an error for 
1% or 2% lines (3.53 or 5.65 mm.). 

Pyractonema bifenestrata (Fairmaire and Germain) 

Figure 3 
Lucidota bifenestrata Fairmaire and Germain, Coleop. Chilensia, vol. 2, p. 2, 1862. 

Material: 125 males and 38 females. 

Dimensions: Males 9.6 to 15.0 mm. long by 3.0 to 5.0 mm. broad; 
average 12.3 by 4.1 mm. Females 10.5 to 14.0 mm. long by 3.5 to 
5.5 mm. broad; average 12.7 by 4.3 mm. 

Pronotum smaller and narrower than in P. nigripennis. About 
0.8 as long as broad in males, 0.75 in females. 

Elytra about 0.85 of total length in males, 0.7 in females. 

Aedeagus as in figure 3. 

It is noted that there is no reference in the descriptions or key 
to the "two windows" which should apparently be present on 
the pronotum of P. bifenestrata. Two translucent areas in the apical 
portion of the pronotum were observed in several specimens of different 
species, and it seems probable that these areas are a modification 
of the pronotal pigmentation which may occur generally in this genus.

Material: 14 males and 1 female. 

General: A small, narrow, nonluminous lampyrid with a relatively 
small coral-red pronotum. 

Dimensions: Males 7.3 to 11.9 mm. long by 2.0 to 3.5 mm. broad; 
average 9.26 by 2.8 mm. Female 6.8 mm. long by 2.6 mm. broad. 

Pronotum small, 0.8 as long as broad. Occasionally widest at basal 
third or half. Posterolateral angles variable in acuteness and posi- 
tion relative to the lateral margins. Laterally somewhat reflexed. 
Disc opaque coral-red, with no median vitta, but usually a sulcus 
in basal half. A narrow black border around the red area, sometimes 
brownish just forward of eyes. 



FIREFLY GENUS PYRACTONEMA — McDERMOTT 155 

Scutellum and mesonotal plates black, the latter dull. 

Elytra in males about 0.85 of total length. In females about 0.8 
of total length. Parallel, uniformly black. Very narrow explanate 
margins. No pale borders or other ornamentation. 

Head presents no specific features and is very similar to that of 
the nigripennis group. 

Antennae black, hairy, compressed, generally similar to those in 
the nigripennis group. In occasional specimens articles 3 to 10 were 
noticeably wider in proportion to length than usual. 

Tergites all black. Pygidium truncate, sinuate, or tridentate api- 
cally, not greatly widened over last abdominal segments. 

Ventral segments usually all black, sometimes medially brown. 
Little or no evidence of luminous organs. 

Legs black. Tibial spurs not discernible. Claws simple. 

Aedeagus as in figure 9. 

Solier remarks on the wide range of size in this species. It is curi- 
ous, however, that his description of this species says nothing definite 
about a "red neck," other than the two red spots on the pronotum, 
which would not differentiate it from the foregoing group of species. 
This description leads me to suspect that Solier may have missed 
the true specimens of P. rhododera and written his description from 
others belonging in the P. nigripennis group. The "red necks" here 
described somewhat resemble P. albomarginata but lack the pale 
elytral borders.

NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICAN COPEPODS OF THE GENUS 
HEMICYCLOPS (CYCLOPOIDA : CLAUSIDIIDAE) 



By Richard U. Gooding 1 



Introduction 



Species of the genus Hemicyclops Boeck have been found on both 
east and west coasts of the American continents. Those previously 
described are thysanotus Wilson, callianassae Wilson, pugettensis Light 
and Hartman, purpureas Boeck, adhaerens (Williams), americanus 
Wilson and elongatus Wilson; subadhaerens and arenicolae are added 
in this review. Little is known about their ecology or distribution, but 
all appear to be intertidal forms or inhabitants of shallow water and 
some to live in association with other animals. To the latter 
category belong at least one and possibly both of the new forms 
described. 

This study forms the first part of a revision of the genus Hemi- 
cyclops. An attempt on the larger task has seemed inappropriate at 
present for two reasons. First, lack of information on the morphology 
of larval stages in the Clausidiidae (to which all the genera mentioned 
in this paragraph belong) prevents an adequate evaluation of Nicholls' 
suggestion (1944, pp. 49-51) that the genus Saphirella T. Scott repre- 
sents "the young form of Hemicyclops." Second, although some 
trends shown by the species described in this paper suggest that the

genera Hersiliodes Canu (see Bocquet and Stock, 1957, for a dis- 
cussion of the species currently included in this genus) and Giardella 
Canu can be synonymized with He?nicyclops, I have not had a chance 
to examine representatives of either. 

Thus, no definition of the genus is given here. All the species dis- 
cussed share with the type species (H. yuvpureus Boeck, 1873, coast of 
Norway) the lack of suckers on any of the appendages, a basic terminal 
mandibular armature of four articulated processes, the presence 
in the adult female of well-developed maxillipeds, and caudal 
rami whose length does not exceed five times their width. H. thy- 
sanotus, the first species treated here, since it was more intensively 
studied, has been described somewhat more fully. Descriptions of j 
the females of the other species are intended to be read with reference 
to those preceding them; accounts of the males are, in addition, 
supplementary to the descriptions of their respective females. It is 
hoped that the illustrations, which represent in full the observations 
I have been able to make, will alleviate any inconvenience this 
arrangement may cause. A key to the American species is given 
on p. 165. 

The terminology and abbreviations used are the same as those 
of a previous paper (Gooding, 1957), except that "protopodite" I 
replaces "basipodal segments" and "element" replaces "articulated 
process"; "ornamentation" is restricted to "the complement of cilia 1 
and/or spinules of a particular structure"; and "armature" denotes 
"the complement of setae and/or spines of a particular structure."] 
The last two definitions are, with permission, quoted from an un- 
published thesis by Dr. Patricia Dudley. Terms such as "ventral," 
"anterior," and "right," when used in describing appendages or their 
parts, refer to these structures as they are oriented in the intact 
animal: e.g., "inner side of maxilliped" is the side nearest the animal's 
median longitudinal axis. For appendages which may change their 
orientation, the most usual position has been chosen for the de- 
scription. Alternative terms are given in the legends to the figures. 
The phrase "burrow water" is used to refer to subsurface water ac- 
cumulating in the hole created when digging for burrowing animals 
(in this case, callianassids) .

Subsurface water: Golden Gardens City Park, Seattle, Washington, lat. 47°43' 
N., long. 121°24' W., 1,000 cc, from muddy sand with scattered stones, February

The use of lactic acid in copepodological workfhas already been 
mentioned briefly (Gooding, 1957). This fluid is particularly suitable 
as a temporary mountant for small arthropods since it is directly 
miscible with most general preservatives, penetrates rapidly, clears 
satisfactorily, evaporates slowly, and has a low refractive index. It 
also renders specimens supple, so that dissection is facilitated. How- 
ever, since it macerates the soft parts of the body, it cannot be used 
when the animals are required for study of the internal anatomy. 
The following procedure has proved very useful and should be appli- 
cable to small Crustacea other than copepods. 

A coverslip of sufficient size is fastened over the hole in a Bio-Plastic 
Micromount Holder (Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Inc., 
Rochester, N.Y.) . Since this hole perforates the plastic slide, the two 
parts together form essentially a deep-well slide. The use of modelling 
clay for attaching the coverslip allows the latter to be removed easily 
whenever necessary. The specimen is then mounted in a small drop 
of lactic acid at the bottom of the "well" (i.e., centrally on the face of 
the coverslip nearest the slide) . Staining is usually unnecessary and 
often undesirable but, if required, a weak solution of methyl blue in 
lactic acid may be used as the mountant. 

When observations and drawings are being made, the slide should be 
placed coverslip uppermost so that the specimen is protected in a 
hanging drop within the cavity. If a coverslip of sufficient thinness 
is used initially, even an oil-immersion objective can be employed for 
examination, although, of course, some resolution is lost since the 
condenser cannot be oiled. The reverse position of the slide allows 
dissection and rearrangement of the animal or its appendages to be 
made with ease on the stage of a dissecting microscope. Any append- 
age which cannot be manipulated so as to show the relation of its parts 
satisfactorily can be removed to a standard microscope slide and 
flattened partially in a drop of lactic acid under a coverslip. Movement 
of the latter will usually produce the desired position (see the figures 
of "flattened" appendages included below, e.g., 5d). 

Such temporary mounts will remain in good condition for long 
periods if protected from dust and if the lactic acid is renewed occa- 
sionally. Hoyer's mediimi (see Baker and Wharton, 1952, pp. 10-11, 
for formula) has proved satisfactory as a permanent mountant since 
specimens can be transferred to it directly from lactic acid. 

A camera lucida was used in making all drawings. This device also 
permitted a simple and accurate method for comparing a series of 
specimens of one species. Drawings of the copepod first examined 



COPEPOD GENUS HEMICYCLOPS — GOODING 163 

were viewed simultaneously with the images of later mounts similarly 
oriented through the appropriate combination of lenses. Scales of 
magnification for each of the lens combinations used were drawn from 
a stage micrometer. The method for stereoscopic microscopy de- 
scribed by Galbraith (1957) proved very helpful in determining the 
shape and relations of appendages. 

Among the many persons and agencies who have assisted me from 
time to time, I wish to thank particularly Dr. Paul Illg for much 
helpful discussion, suggestions, and encouragement during all phases 
of this work; Drs. Ernst Florey and K. L. Osterud for their critical 
reading of the manuscript; Drs. Fenner A. Chace, Jr., and Thomas 
E. Bowman of the U.S. National Museum for arranging the loan of 
material from the National Museum collections; and several others 
named in the text for supplying me with specimens either of copepods 
or of their hosts and information. The State of Washington, through 
Dr. Illg, provided support for part of the woik and some facilities. 

Genus Hemicyclops Boeck 

Hemicyclops Boeck, 1873, p. 42; etc. 

Of the seven species of Hemicyclops previously described from North 
and South America, three are considered valid and one doubtful; 
two new ones are added. Although very few specimens of each 
species have been examined, the small amount of variation between 
individuals of a particular form has made it possible to be some- 
what more definite on points of specific discrimination than the evi- 
dence available might seem to favor. The following morphological 
characters are considered to have taxonomic value in differentiating 
the species discussed: the nature of the genital segment in the adult 
female; the ornamentation of the antenna and its elements; the ter- 
minal armature of the mandible, maxilla and maxilliped; the orna- 
mentation of the labium; the setal formula of the swimming legs; 
the relative lengths of elements on the fifth legs; the presence (and 
nature) or absence of sixth legs; and the modification of setae on 
the caudal rami. These characters permit us to divide the American 
species into two well-defined groups: the first comprising thysanotus 
(and purpureas if it occurs in these waters, see p. 176), the other includ- 
ing adhaerens, subadkaerens, arenicolae, and probablv elonrjatns. (Lack 
of knowledge about the mouthparts and maturity of the only specimen 
available precludes any completely certain disposition of elongatus.) 

It is difficult at this stage to determine whether the second group 
represents a polytypic species or a superspecific complex. I have 
preferred the latter alternative because the morphological differences 
between its members are approximately equivalent to those currently 



164 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

used (Humes, 1949, 1957) in characterizing the species of Clausidium, 
a genus belonging to the same family, and the ecological differences are 
much greater; also with respect to adhaerens and arenicolae, there is 
some evidence for sympatry, although no intermediates occurred 
among the specimens that I have examined. 

This superspecies would be characterized mainly by the separation 
between genital and first abdominal segments and the well-developed 
sixth legs in the adult females; the reduced mandibular setation 
and presence only of simple terminal elements on the maxilla and 
of setulose exopod spines on all the swimming legs in both sexes; and 
the attenuated "scaly'' tip of the male maxilliped. Its members are 
known only from the New World but appear morphologically quite 
similar to the species of Giardella that have been reported from the 
coasts of France and England. 

The species discussed range from forms found free-living {adhaerens) 
to those which, under natural conditions, seem to remain in contact 
with their hosts (thysanotus and elongatusl). Intermediate between 
these extremes are associates which may inhabit the burrow but 
seldom stray onto the body of the host (subadhaerens) , or apparently 
are equally common in the one as on the other (arenicolae). Further 
work is needed to determine whether species of the first type are 
really independent and, for forms associated with other animals, 
what are the relations of copepod and host. 

A feature of the species thysanotus and subadhaerens (the only ones 
examined alive) is the presence, mainly in the prosome, of droplets of 
a red, oily-appearing material among the organs. It appears to be 
incorporated in the eggs, and to a lesser extent the spermatophores, 
and occurs in the nauplii. Such stored material is very characteristic 
of species of Clausidium,, which are also associated with Callianassa. 
It is responsible for the bright red color of these copepods. Its presence 
seems not to depend on an association with callianassids, however, for 
Sars (1917) described a female of the apparently free-living Hemi- 
cyclops purpureus as having "bright red" ovarial tubes and ovisacs. 
These observations are consistent with what is known about carotenoid 
metabolism in copepods and other Crustacea and, if chemically of 
this nature, the substance probably has its origin in the organism's 
food (Fox, 1953). Thus, in species associated with Callianassa, it 
could presumably be derived from plant and/or bacterial matter, from 
the host's blood, or from the eggs of berried female mud shrimp. 

The key below refers to the presently known species of Hemi- 
cy clops that I have examined from North and South America. It is 
applicable to the adults of both sexes but will probably also serve to 
distinguish immature specimens, at least to morphological group. 
The structure of the maxillipeds and the nature and position of the 



COPEPOD GENUS HEMICYCLOPS — GOODING 165 

sixth legs will most easily differentiate adult males from females. 
Dissection should not be necessary in following the key but use of a 
compound microscope and generally some preliminary clearing 
treatment (discussed on p. 162) will be essential.

outside surface of the eolid, Hermissienda [sic] crassicornis, in Elkhorn 
Slough, Monterey Bay" (Wilson, 1935), USNM 64063, here considered 
syntypes. 

The designated types for callianassae were "a single female with 
attached male" (Wilson, 1935), USNM 60432. Of these only the 
male syntype appears to be still in existence (letter from Dr. T. E. 
Bowman, February 25, 1958). II. pugettensis was stated by Light 
and Hartman (1937, p. 182) to be based on a single specimen, but 
the catalog number that they quote (USNM 71678) comprises a 
(syntypic) series including females and males. There is no record 
of a holotype in the U.S. National Museum.

fleeted light) opaque white with red areas, mainly in the pro-some 
around or coloring the oviducts, which tend to give a general reddish 
appearance on the whole body when viewed with the naked eye; fifth 
legs and caudal rami occasionally brown; eye and ovisacs bright red. 

Prosomo comprising a ccphalothorax, with no trace of division 
between cephalosome and first pedigcrous somite, and 3 metasomal 
segments whose terga are usually imbricate, with square or rounded 
corners. Prosome ovate but posteriorly truncate in dorsal outline, 
flattened in side view. Eye of the usual naupliar type. Rostrum 
(fig. 2b) a small fold, apparently in tcrgum of ccphalothorax, produc- 
ing this ventrally between bases of antennules. Postoral protuberance 
inconspicuous. 

Urosome 5-segmented. Largest the genital segment, which almost 
certainly represents a complex of 2 somites, the boundary between 
them represented ventrally and occasionally in dorsal view by a 
thickened ridge. (Light and Hartman, 1937, give a very good picture 
of this segment in their figure 12. This figure shows the structure of 
the anterior part of the segment- — i.e., genital somite proper- — with 
its 2 pairs of small lateral expansions. The dorsal anterior pair of 
expansions are often joined along the dorsal surface by a thickened 
strip and make the anterior part of the segment wider than the 
posterior region — i.e., first abdominal somite.) Paired oviducal open- 
ings ventrolateral on anterior corners of genital segment. Ovisacs 
with numerous eggs, usually reaching ends of caudal rami, narrowly 
cylindrical. Three free abdominal segments, the last here termed 
the anal segment and carrying a row of fine spinules ventrally along 
each side of distal border near midline. Anus dorsal, without dis- 
tinct anal operculum; oval-shaped area in figure 21 having a very 
thin integument. 

Caudal rami more than 3% times as long as wide; bearing 4 termi- 
nal setae and an outer lateral and an inner dorsolateral seta, all distally 
placed. Outermost terminal and usually outer lateral seta comprised 
of a basal shaft, ending in a small spiniform projection on one or both 
sides, and a terminal "flagcllum" whose thickening is broken up into 
transverse rings. Two longest setae with usual "jointed" attachment 
at base. 

Antennulc 7-segmented. Attachment of basal segment to ventral 
exoskeleton of head region at right angles to plane of projection of 
remainder of appendage. Appendage in life carried perpendicular 
to sagittal plane of body. Last 3 segments slightly narrower than 
and their axis at an angle to preceding 4. Setation: 4 on first, 15 
on second, G on third, 3 on fourth, 4 on fifth, 2 and an aesthete on 
sixth, 7 and an aesthete on seventh. Long setae on fourth and ter- 
minal segments very obvious. One seta on second and one on fifth 



COPEPOD GENUS HEMICYCLOPS — GOODING 1G9 

segment the only ones completely ciliated but several with cilia near 
tips. Almost all setae with thickening in transverse rings. Aesthetes 
narrow and rather inconspicuous, with basally thickened walls. 

Last 3 segments of tetramerous antenna typically bent at right 
angles to first and lying near mouth region. (Subsequent terminology 
with reference to this position.) Fourth segment offset in fashion 
typical of clausidiids; almost quadrate; bearing terminally on dorsal 
side a seta, with long heavy cilia, in a notch on the outer edge 2 
spinulose setae, and 4 curved setae inserted linearly along width of 
distal border between the two groups. Two proximal of the 3 "comb 
rows" of spinules on this segment difficult to see. Outer corner of 
third segment produced distally for more than half length of fourth; 
2 characteristically ornamented spines at its tip; a curved seta and 
another shorter seta in recess between this projection and insertion of 
fourth segment. Surface thickening of 5 curved setae on antenna 
irregular from region of initial curvature to tip; the latter either 
notched (in the longest 2) or finely toothed on the inner side. Other 
ornamentation and armature of appendage as shown in figure 2d. 

Mouth region (fig. 2e) and adjoining appendages closely compacted 
in typical poecilostome fashion, their arrangement very similar to that 
of //. audralis (Nicholls, 1944, fig. 21) or purpureas (Sars, 1917, 
pi. lxxxi, "Or. area"). Labrum protruding from ventral body surface; 
posterior border straight, its median portion with 2 rows of small 
denticles set one above the other. Each flange forming posterior 
corner of labrum with 2 rows of larger denticles; upper row turning 
dorsally (i.e., toward mouth) at its inner end. Sides of labrum nearest 
mouth cavity flaring sharply away from a median "prow" which 
overhangs mouth. Labium a flat rectangular surface delimited by 
thickenings in ventral cxoskeleton of head region; its anterior half 
beset with rows of denticles pointing toward mouth. Between latter 
and labium is a square area, the roof of the mouth cavity, clothed in 
cilia and rising medially into a bilobed prominence. Paragnaths 
inserting laterally on roof of mouth cavity anterior to labial corners; 
thick, comma-shaped flaps profusely ciliated; oriented nearly at right 
angles to surface beneath, with tips approaching each other on midline. 

Mandible with strongly thickened triangular base. Body of 
appendage curves toward midline, backwards and upward, fitting 
under sides of labral "prow" so that tip lies in mouth cavity. Ter- 
minal armature a heavy, curved element, a spinulose blade, and 2 
setae with strong cilia; all articulated. Dorsal element dentate along 
one edge, with an incompletely toothed ridge at an angle on anterior 
side. 

Flaplike maxillule distally bilobed : smaller lobe with 3, larger 
(outer) with 5 setae, majority strongly ciliated and with transverse 



172 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Only the 3 spines nearest base exopodite of first swimming leg with a 
terminal setule. Base of most median seta on third endopodite seg- 
ment of legs 2-4 with a group of 3 or 4 strong cilia. Other ornamen- 
tation as shown in the figures. 

Fifth legs 2-segmented; inserted on ventrolateral corners of thoracic 
segment. First podomere small and square, almost hidden in dorsal 
view by a lateral projection (which shows remnant of tergum) of tho- 
racic segment; its seta, borne on a papilla on outer distal corner, 
nearly as long as terminal segment. Latter lamellar; with a slight 
outward and upward curve; bearing 2 spines set stepwise on outer 
edge of distal half, a long seta on a small papilla and a finely ciliated 
spine terminally. Terminal segment ornamented with spinules on 
outer and strong cilia on inner edge. (Several specimens from Puget 
Sound region have also a "sunburst" of well-developed cilia near base 
on ventral side.) 

Sixth legs apparently absent. 

Redescription of the male: Body 1.53 mm. in length (mean of 
6 specimens, range 1.50-1.54 mm.) and 0.65 mm. (0.64-0.70 mm.) 
wide; paler in color than female. Urosome longer in proportion to 
prosome and the latter more ovate. Genital segment not compound 
so that urosome 6-segmented. Paired genital ducts opening ventro- 
laterally in posterior half of genital segment. Spermatophores (fig. 
lq) small kidney-shaped structures with a short stalk. (When at- 
tached to the female, they are rather smaller than indicated by the 
figure.) Caudal rami shorter in proportion to their width than those 
of female. 

Ciliated seta on second segment of antennule not as well-developed 
as in female. 

Antenna occasionally without patch of spinules on inner distal 
corner of second segment. 

Posterior limit of labium difficult to distinguish; denticles present 
in female here reduced to small spinules or cilia. 

Mandible and maxillule very similar to female condition, but for- 
mer may apparently lack second seta on one or other side.

Most ventral seta on second segment of female maxilla replaced 
here by a heavily sclerotised but unornamented hook which is con- 
fluent with the segment. 

Maxilliped similar in basic plan to that of female but very different 
in appearance. Only 1 seta on basal segment; 2 on second, which is 
heart-shaped with several rows of spinules (the largest near base of 
segment), much reduced in size and ornamentation and widely sepa- 
rated. Terminal segment extended into a long, thick, curved process 
bearing 3 setae as shown in the figure. (Longest of these setae is 
very closely appressed to and often seems partially fused with basal 
region of process ; this part may represent instead of a seta a partially 
separated membrane. It is difficult to homoligize the armature of 
this segment with that found in the female.) 

Only change in armature of swimming legs is loss of spine on inner 
distal margin of first basipodite. 

First podomere of fifth legs completely fused with thoracic segment 
but its seta and ornamentation remaining. Bases of this pair of legs 
connected ventrally by a thickened strip. Strong cilia on inner edge 
of terminal segment in female replaced by fewer spinules here and 
these more distal in position. 

Sixth legs form paired flaps covering, in ventral view, most of 
posterior half of genital segment ; a curved spine on each ventrolateral 
corner. 

Remarks: My observations support neither the differences educed 
by Wilson (1935) between H. callianassae and thysanotus nor the 
characters stressed as diagnostic for pugettensis by Light and Hartman 
(1937). Accordingly, the three species are here considered identical. 
Since pugettensis is clearly a junior synonym, the valid name must 
be selected from the other two. 

H. callianassae and thysanotus were described in the same publi- 
cation (Wilson, 1935); the former, since it was listed first and de- 
scribed in equal detail, would normally become the species name. 
However, I propose to take advantage of "the principle of the first 
reviser," reinstated in 1953 (International Commission on Zoological 
Nomenclature, pp. 66-67), and examine the problem posed in this 
instance by Giardella. 

As mentioned earlier (p. 160), the genus Giardella Canu, whose type 
species (by monotypy) is 6. callianassae Canu, 1888, is very closely 
related to Hemicyclops. In studying the literature, I have come to the 
conclusion that it may eventually be desirable to expand the generic 
concept of Hemicyclops so as to include this species. If page priority 
is strictly applied in the case of Wilson's form, however, and callianas- 
sae is chosen, any later merging of Giardella with Hemicyclops would 
make it necessary to alter the name of his species. I believe that there 



COPEPOD GENUS HEMICYCLOPS — GOODING 175 

is thus sufficient reason for considering the "other things" not to be 
"equal" (the present wording of Article 28 of the Rules of Zoological 
Nomenclature), and hence in the interests of stability, I have preferred 
thyanotus to callianassae for designating this Pacific Coast species. 

It should be noted that MacGinitie's order of listing (1935) cannot 
be used to support this choice (i.e., by dating Wilson's species from 
his paper) since, although technically the first mention of thysa/notus 
and callianassae in the literature, his names per se must be considered 
nomina nuda. 

H. thysanotus seems very close to thomsoni (Canu) and to dilatatus 
Shen and Bai. For the present, however, the following characters 
will serve to diagnose the species: the fusion of first abdominal and 
genital somites; the ornamentation of the antenna, particularly the 
heavy ciliation on one of its terminal setae; the armature of the last 
maxillar segment; the presence of setule-bearing spines on the exo- 
podite of the first swimming leg only; the shape and ornamentation 
of the distal segment of the fifth legs; and the modified setae on the 
caudal rami. Specimens in the northerly part of its range are, as 
might be expected, larger and their appendages, particularly with 
respect to armature and ornamentation, often better developed; but 
no meristic differences among specimens have been observed. Nor 
could I find evidence for the existence of host-specific forms. 

Distribution: The species is known to range from San Juan Island, 
Washington, to Monterey Bay, California, and occurs on four hosts, 
the nudibranch Hermissenda crassicornis and the thalassinids Ca/li- 
anassa gigas, C. califomiensis, and Upogebia pugettensis. All of these 
hosts are common within the copepod's entire range, but there are 
some puzzling irregularities in its geographical distribution on them. 
From Oregon south, thysanotus seems to be abundant on Upogebia 
and, in California (MacGinitie, 1935; MacGinitie and MacGinitie, 
1949), on Hermissenda and C. califomiensis; yet over a period of 2)i 
years of collecting, I have not found specimens on an} r of these three 
in the Puget Sound region. The statement in Gooding (1958), that 
thysanotus occurred on C. califomiensis at Nanaimo was based on a 
misindentification. Locally, but apparently not in California, it is 
abundant on C. gigas. 

The ecological factor common to Hermissenda and callianassids as 
habitats is also difficult to visualize. In association with the latter 
animals, thysanotus is generally found in the gill-chamber but may 
also occur on the surface of the body. Although it may leave its host 
for a short time when the latter is placed in a dish of seawater, the 
copepod has never been found in water from the burrows. On Hermis- 
senda, thysanotus occurs on the body surface (MacGinitie). Nothing 
is known about its feeding habits; MacGinitie (1935) suggests that it 

53441G— 60 3 



176 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

may remove debris from among the eggs of Gallianassa and, if so, it 
may also help to keep the gill-chamber clean. It is hoped that further 
collecting and possibly experimental work will make clear the host 
preferences and relations with the host of this copepod. 

Immature specimens occasionally are found in debris from pre- 
served Gallianassa; the smallest corresponds to the second copepodid 
stage in other copepods. It is possible that the early stages are free 
living and dispersive, development only being completed when a host 
is found. 

Hemicyclops purpureus Boeck 

Hemicyclops purpureus Boeck, 1873, p. 42; etc. 

This species was reported by Wilson (1936, pp. 368, 375) from 
plankton collected in Fox Channel (lat. 66-67° N., long. 80° W.), 
northern Canada, by Captain R. A. Bartlett in August 1933, but no 
diagnosis or figures are given. Taking into account both the restricted 
range otherwise known for purpureus (coasts of Norway, Sweden, and 
possibly Scotland) and Wilson's lapses in descriptions of other species 
in this genus, I do not think that his record can be accepted at present 
entirely without question. If correct, however, his record would be 
of great interest, and it is hoped that further collections in that area 
will confirm his identification. Such confirmation is unfortunately 
impossible now since the specimen (or specimens) that he examined 
are not in the U.S. National Museum, where the Bartlett collection 
was deposited (letter from Dr. T. E. Bowman, November 21, 1957). 

Because I have not examined specimens, no other account of 
purjmreus is given here and it is not included in the key. On the basis 
of Sars' redescription (1917), the species apparently differs from 
thy&anotus in the proportions of the caudal rami and of the fifth legs 
and in the armature of the third segments of both rami on the fourth 
swimming leg. It may readily be distinguished from adhaerens, 
subadhaerens, elongatus, and arenicolae by the presence in these of the 
following: 6-segmented urosome, reduced mandibular setation, 4 
simple terminal elements on the maxilla, shorter maxillipedal process 
(of the female) and different armature of the swimming legs.

did not designate a typo nor mention where his specimens were 
deposited. 

H. americanus was based (Wilson, 1932b) on a holotypc which, 
together with one paratype, was deposited in the U.S. National 
Museum. The vial of his specimens received from there contained 
a "type" label (among others), which reads "Holotype Cat. No. 
58563/To be selectcd/Paratype Cat. No. 63420," and two smaller 
unlabeled vials, each with a single copepod. There is no indication 
which of these Wilson intended to designate as the holotype, and 
hence they are here considered syn types of americanus. 

Specimens examined: Wickford, Rhode Island, 1 female from 
washings of intertidal rocks, G. M. Moore and N. W. Riser, June 
13, 1057; this topotype was dissected and used for making all the 
figures; the slide has been deposited in the U.S. National Museum, 
USNM 101729. Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, 2 females from bottom 
tow, U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Station R' (off Cove Point), R. P. 
Cowles, June 2, 1921, syn types of americanus (one was dissected). 

Redescmption of the female: Body very similar in appearance 
to ihysanotus but genital segment not fused with first abdominal so 
that urosome is 6-segmentcd. Length 1.58 mm. (mean of 3 speci- 
mens, range 1.43-1.67 mm.); width of prosome 0.64 mm. (0.57-0.69 
mm.). Genital segment roundish; genital openings median and 
lateral. Ovisacs (one specimen) proportionately wider than those 
of ihysanotus but only reaching distal border of second abdominal 
segment. Lines of spinules on distal border of anal segment much 
stronger than in ihysanotus and displaced outward. 

Caudal rami 2-2 K times as long as wide, with relatively long inner 
dorsolateral seta and a tiny clement (which may represent a rudi- 
mentary seta) near base on outer side. No setae modified as in 
ihysanotus. 

Antennule like that of Ihysanotus except for setation on first 2 seg- 
ments (5 on first, 14 on second); long setae on second, fourth, and 
terminal segments relatively shorter and setae on second and fifth 
segments apparently lacking cilia- 
Antenna with fourth segment elongate and distal corner of third 
hardly produced. Armature similar to ihysanotus condition but 
spines on outer distal corner of third segment replaced b}^ setae and 
these, together with that on first segment, with reduced ornamenta- 
tion; isolated seta in terminal position bare. Curved setae with 
region of irregular surface thickening reduced to short length near 
position of greatest curvature and very thin flange often present 
here; tips all with notch some distance from the end. No patch 
of spinules on outer corner of second segment; third with 2 "comb 
rows" on inner side; last with only a row of spinules. 



178 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. nz 

A single row of spinules on posterior border of labrum. Paragnaths 
of somewhat different appearance from those of thysanotus. Anterior 
median portion of labium flowing forward to merge with roof of 
mouth cavity; ornamentation on its surface confined to 2 irregularly 
curved rows of denticles. Two ciliated lobes on roof of mouth cavity 
just posterior to insertion of paragnaths. 

Mandible with curved element and blade but only 1 seta; termi- 
nally curved element lacks incomplete roothed ridge, dentations on 
edge stronger. 

Maxillule very similar in plan to that of thysanotus but angular 
projection poorly developed and more dorsal in position. Some 
differences in relative size and ciliation of setae. 

Setule-bearing seta on first segment of maxilla larger than the other; 
terminal armature of second segment (ventral to dorsal) a strong 
curved spine, 2 smaller ones almost side by side — the anterior notched 
at its tip, the other strongly ciliated — and a longer spine with strong 
cilia. 

Maxilliped with no seta on third, 2 on terminal segment: longest 
seta on anterior side, other on base of dorsal process. (It is difficult to 
homologize the smaller seta with any on the thysanotus maxilliped.) 
Ventral spine bearing only 2 spinules on anteroventral surface and 
terminating in a setule inserted near tip. Both setae on first segment 
with very long cilia. 

Swimming legs similar to those of thysanotus except in armature, 
which is:

Seta on proximal segment of fifth legs short; distal podomere a 
shape different from that of thysanotus, with spinules on inner and 
outer sides mainly in 2 patches near spines; seta on this segment sub- 
terminal, only as long as spine on its inner side. 

Sixth legs consisting of 3 setae, borne on a papilla sunk between 2 
flaps, near middle of genital segment. 

No male has yet been reported. A spermatophore was, however, 
attached to the genital segment of the female depicted (fig. 4a) ; it is 
similar to those found in this position on thysanotus. 

Remarks: Williams' description and figures make it relatively easy 
to identify my specimen with his species in spite of some discrepancies. 
That of maxillipedal segmentation is probably due to a difference in 
interpretation; others (such as ciliation of some antennular setae and 
armature of third antennal, terminal maxillar, and last maxillipedal 
segments) may be differences in observation ; but the presence of a single 
element on the mandible can only be explained, in my opinion, by 
supposing that this appendage was mutilated in his specimen. Since 
the mouthparts are very difficult to dissect free in poecilostome 
copepods, and since Williams implied in his description that he was 
uncertain about the exact relation of parts in this region, this assump- 
tion does not seem unreasonable. 

Wilson (1932b) did not differentiate his species in any way from 
adhaerens; nor did he state what features of americanus he con- 
sidered diagnostic. Examination of his type specimens failed to 
disclose any evidence for partial fusion of the genital with the first 
abdominal segment, an additional seta on the second antennal seg- 
ment, the peculiar ornamentation of the terminal curved setae on 
the antenna, or the extensive spinulation and fourth spine on the fifth 
leg. In other respects, his descriptions and figures are close both to 
Williams' account and my own observations, and the name of his 
species is thus considered a synonym of adhaerens. 

II. adhaerens is quite distinct from thysanotus as the description 
above indicates. Its differences from the other species discussed in 
this paper are considered in the accounts of those species. 

Distribution: Specimens have been found only at Wickford, 
Rhode Island, and in Chesapeake Bay. None occurred in the only 
collection made locally for it (p. 162). Correspondence with Dr. C. J. 
Fish and the presence of a single female in a collection made specifi- 
cally for this copepod by Drs. Moore and Riser suggest that the 
species may no longer be abundant in the type locality, or that the 
proper habitat is still unknown.

mens, range 1.97-2.24 mm.) in length; width of prosome 0.91 mm. 
(0.74-1.2 mm.). Inner dorsolateral seta on caudal rami rather longer 
in proportion to the others. Armature and ornamentation of append- 
ages in general more strongly developed. Denticles on labium much 
stronger and more widely spaced; arranged in 2 deep crescents, one 
on either side of midline. Mandible with a rudimentary second seta. 
Ventral spine on terminal segment of maxilliped with 3-5 denticles on 
antcroventral side. Terminal spine on fifth legs proportionately 
smaller; setae on both podomeres longer: specifically, seta on 
terminal segment longer than terminal spine. Ornamentation of 
distal segment stronger and more extensive. Color iu life verj 
similar to that of thysanotus. 

Description of the male: Size of body, unlike condition in 
thysanotus, more or less equaling that of female: 2.05 mm. (mean of 
7 specimens, range 1.9-2.3 mm.) long, width of prosome 0.8 mm. 
(0.77-0.84 mm.). General appearance very similar. »Spermatophores 
attached to genital segment of female all flattened but, when iu body 
of male, like those of thysanotus. 



182 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Antennule, antenna, mandible, maxillule, and maxilla essentially 
the same as in female, although maxilla has a peculiar hump on 
outer side of base of second segment which is not found in that of 
female. 

Maxilliped, as is usual in poccilostomes, a prehensile structure, sim- 
ilar to that of thysanotus, but: first segment with a small hooklike 
process and 2 setae on inner face; second segment not as wide 
and bearing a peculiar "cock's comb" projection also on inner 
face; last segment with attenuated tip, ornamented with scalelike 
thickenings, and 2 setae (if element on inner side of angle — like that 
similarly placed in thysanotus — actually represents a seta). 

Endopodites of second and, to a lesser extent, third legs very much 
more elongate than those of female, as are spines — particularly the 
innermost— on these rami; but setae on third segment somewhat 
reduced. Armature of all legs as represented in table for female 
adhaerens (p. 178) and ornamentation shown in figure bj-i; both like 
those of female. 

Spines on outer edge distal segment of fifth legs rather more offset; 
lengths of terminal spine and seta next to it not as divergent as, 
and ornamentation rather less than, in female. 

Sixth legs covering a much smaller area of genital segment than in 
thysanotus and spine usually extending posteriorly, but general 
structure of appendage similar to male of that species. 

Remarks: As the descriptions and figures show, this species is very 
close to adhaerens (hence its name). The differences between the 
females (it is unfortunate that the male adhaerens is unknown) seem 
almost of subspecific rank. However, with no intermediate morpho- 
logical forms, well-separated ranges and the apparent difference in 
habitat, I think that their relation can at present be best indicated 
by making subadhaerens of equal rank. 

Since this species apparently occupies the same range as tltysanotus 
and is also associated with Callianassa (see below), it might represent 
one of the forms now equated with thysanotus (callianassae or puget- 
tensis). However, reference to the literature showed that the only 
evidence in favor of this view was Wilson's figure (1935, pi. 27,

fig. 25) of the female callianassae, and a stud}'' of the type material of 
the latter (p. 165) has made it plain that Wilson was not dealing with 
subadhaerens. 

It is necessary nonetheless to distinguish subadhaerens from thy- 
sanotus. In life, a difference is easily seen since subadhaerens carries 
the fourth legs characteristically at right angles to the ventral body 
surface. It is possible to distinguish even the youngest stages that 
I have examined in this way. Preserved adults can easily be sepa- 
rated by the condition of the genital segment in the females and the 
sixth legs in the males. It is only when dead immature specimens are 
being sorted that one need resort to the key characters given (p. 165). 

Distribution: This species has been found from Nanaimo, British 
Columbia, to Bodega Bay, California. The data available suggest 
that both sexes are associated with Callianassa californiensis but 
occur in the burrow rather than on the body of the animal. This 
behavior is most clearly shown by the collection at C.6 on February 
2, 1958, when 24 specimens were recovered from "burrow water" — 
in this case about 200 cc. — and only 2 from 12 hosts. Only the 
later developmental stages have been found.

Type and specimen examined: Holotype female, USNM 60431, 
from gill cavity of Callianassa sp., Salaverry, North Peru, F. Sears, 
October 21, 1926. This, the only known specimen, was examined 
without dissection in alcohol. 

Redescription of the female: Habitus of body agreeing with 
Wilson's description except that terga of prosomal segments now not 
"closely imbricate" (compare Wilson's, 1937, fig. 1 and my fig. 8a) pos- 
sibly due to shrinkage during prolonged immersion in alcohol. The ap- 
parent fold in the exoskeleton at the anterior end of the cephalothorax 
and the fact that my measurements make the body somewhat smaller 
(length 2.7 mm. instead of 3.0 mm., 0.89 mm. wide rather than 0.90

The male is unknown. 

Remarks: This species cannot with absolute certainty be placed 
in the genus Hemicyclops without further knowledge of its mouth- 
parts, but there is good evidence for and apparently none against 
placing it here. There is also no assurance that the holot3 r pe is 
mature. 

H. elongalus is very similar to adhaerens and subadhaerens in general 
characters of bod} 7- and the appendages known. The only important 
differences appear to be its size, greater length rwidth ratio of the 
caudal rami and last antennular segment, and the segmentation of 
the latter appendage. 

Distribution: The only information is that given above. Again, 
there is insufficient evidence to place the species definitely as an 
associate of Callianassa, although Wilson's statement that the holo- 
type occurred in the gill-chamber is more positive than our present 
knowledge about subadhaerens. But it is possible that elongalus also 
occurs in burrow water.

Description op the female: Body 2.65 mm. in length (mean of 
6 specimens, range 2.54-3.0 mm.). Prosome narrower (0.89 mm., 
0.84-0.94 mm.) in proportion to its length than in any of the other 
species; terga separated, their corners rounded. Urosome more than 
twice length of prosome. Ovisacs long and narrow. First 3 ab- 
dominal segments with narrow ventral membrane posteriorly; anal 
segment with row of small spinules along posterior border. 

Length of caudal rami about 3 times width; hairlike element on 
outer side near base less well-developed than in H. adhaerens or 
subadhaerens. 

Antennule as in figure 9b. Curved seta on outer side of slightly 
protruding distal corner on third segment of antenna rather stouter 
than in the other species; spines on tip of projection like those of 
thysanotus. Inner faces of second and third segments swollen; with 
large patches of regularly arranged spinules; rows of larger spinules 
(which have a peculiar flattened and frayed appearance) on outer 
sides third and terminal segments. 

Spinules on labrum confined to a row along each edge. Paragnath 
with cutting edge notched; row of long cilia on posterior surface not 
as well developed as in adhaerens. Labium with very fine spinules 
confined to raised median portion which abuts on roof of mouth 
cavity; occasionally a row of small denticles on each side behind these. 

Mandible may have no trace of a second seta in addition to curved 
element and blade. Latter somewhat curved, unlike condition in the 
other species. 

Maxillule much like that of adhaerens but with well-developed 
anterodorsal prominence. 

Terminal armature of maxilla similar to condition in adhaerens; 
setule-bearing seta on first segment even more enlarged. On one 
maxilla of holotype, armature on this segment is that shown on inset 
to figure 9h.

Ventral spine on terminal segment of maxilliped rather reduced; 
large process stout and, as in the other species, strongly ciliated. 

Swimming legs like those of adhaerens; armature represented by 
same formula (p. 178) and ornamentation similar except that spinules 
on coxal plates of second and third legs form patches rather than 
being confined to edge, setules on exopod spines shorter and strong 
ciliation at base of median seta on third endopod segment apparently 
absent on all legs. 

Fifth and sixth legs also veiy similar to those of adhaerens but 
former lacking spinules on basal segment and on edges of distal 
podomere. 

Description of the male: Body longer (2.83 mm., mean of 10 
specimens, range 2.67-3.24 mm.) than that of female; width of 
prosomc 0.9 mm. (0.84-0.94 mm.). Genital segment almost square 
in dorsal view. No spermatophores found. Caudal rami like those 
of female. 

Antennule similar to, but patches of spinules on second and third 
segments of antenna more extensive than in female. 

Mandible occasionally with a small setule in addition to the normal 
seta. Maxillule and maxilla as in female. 

Maxilliped similar to that of male subadhaerens but with 1 long seta 
on last segment and lacking "cock's comb" on second. 

Swimming legs larger than those of female ; spines longer and better 
developed, but armature the same. Endopodites of second and third 
legs, like condition in male subadhaerens, longer than those of female 
but here last seta on third podomere of second leg reduced to a minute 
setule. 

Fifth leg with basal podomere partly fused to thoracic segment. 
Ornamentation reduced to a ventral line of spinules at base of terminal 
spine. 

Sixth legs like those of subadhaerens male but completely hidden in 
dorsal view; patches of fine denticles on their ventral surface.

Remarks: The species may be distinguished from adhaerens and 
subadhaerens mainly by its length, the proportions of body and caudal 
rami, greater development of the curved seta on third antennal segment 
and ornamentation of that appendage, armature of maxilliped, and 
ornamentation of fifth legs and from //. elongatus by the third to seventh 
of these characters. It is not particularly close to any other form. 

Distribution: All that is known at present is that both sexes are 
external associates of Arenicola cristata from either side of Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts. Only the later copepod stages are represented in the 
two collections.

CHIRONOMID MIDGES OF CALIFORNIA. 

I. CIIIRONOMINAE, EXCLUSIVE OF TANYTARSINI 

(=CALOPSECTRINI) 



By James E. Sublette l 



The nonbiting midges of the family Chironomidae occurring in 
California have been reviewed by Wirth and Stone (1956). Only 
the Clunioninae (Wirth, 1949) and the Tendipedini (Townes, 1945) 
have been adequately treated. The Chironominae exclusive of Tany- 
tarsini are dealt with here. Of the 71 species of Chironomini report- 
ed here as occurring in the State, 47 were not previously listed. The 
Tanytarsini of California will be incorporated in a revision of the 
Nearctic species which I now have in progress. A projected sec- 
ond part to this paper will include the remaining subfamilies ex- 
clusive of Clunioninae. 

Genitalia mounts were made of all male specimens studied. The 
genital capsule, after KOH clearing, was mounted in "Permount/' 
a synthetic mounting resin, on a small celluloid strip following the 
technique used by workers in the British Museum (Natural History). 
The technique was modified by using a cover glass on the mount. 
The celluloid strip was then pinned under the locality label on the 
specimen pin. In some instances accessory slides were made of 
antennae and legs. 

The terminology of wing venation used follows Townes (1945) 
for consistency although Freeman (1955) favors the Tillyard mod- 
ification of the Needham-Comstock system.

While measurements of size (especially wing length) and various 
body ratios have been utilized in species descriptions, in many in- 
stances they are of little diagnostic value because of inadequacy of 
sample size in the original description. For example, Townes (1945) 
averaged only three measurements of each characteristic of each species. 
While admitting its inadequacy from the standpoint of population 
statistics, a compromise was effected here by measuring a minimum 
of three specimens (where available) from each locality and date for 
each species; thus both seasonal and geographic variations are in- 
cluded. For each series of measurements the range is given, followed 
by the mean with the number of specimens upon which the statistic 
is based given in parenthesis. 

The nomenclature is essentially that used by Townes (1945) but 
with some modifications as given by Freeman (1957, 1958) in his 
recent monographic series on African midges. A summary of the 
changes incorporated here is given by Dendy and Sublette (1959). 

This paper is based on four of the larger collections of California 
Chironomidae. For making them available, I thank Dr. J. N. 
Belkin, Department of Entomology, University of California, Los 
Angeles; R. E. Darby, formerly a graduate student at the University 
of California, Davis, now at the Life Sciences Department, Sacra- 
mento State College, Sacramento, California; Dr. A. T. McClay, 
University of California, Davis, and Dr. W. W. Wirth, U.S. De- 
partment of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 

The holo types and material collected by Dr. Wirth are deposited 
in the U.S. National Museum. The deposition of specimens is in-

Paratendipes fuscitibia, new species 

Figure \,a 

Holotype male: USNM 64709, Whitewater Canyon, Riverside Co., 
April 7, 1949, W. 

Head dark brown; mouth parts and antennae infuscate. Thorax 
dark brown, shining; vittae blackish brown, not strongly contracting; 
scutellum somewhat lighter brown; halteres white. Fork of Cu distal 
to r-m; R 4+5 terminates proximal to the point of termination of M. 
Squama well fringed. Femora, except bases, which are stramineous, 
and tibiae mostly concolorous brown. Basal two-thirds of proximal 
tarsal joint white; apical one-third brown, strongly contrasting; 
remaining tarsal joints brown. 

Wing length 2.59 mm.; leg ratio 0.94; antennal ratio 1.53 (slide). 

Abdomen blackish-brown, incisures somewhat lighter. 

Genitalia scarcely distinguishable from P. albimanus (Meigen). 

Paratype : One male collected with type (USNM) . 

Wing length 2.59 mm.; fore tarsi missing; antennal ratio 1.59. 

Female: Unknown. 

This species may be distinguished from the closely related P. 
albimanus (Meigen) by the darkened tibiae, the slightly larger size, 
and the smaller leg ratio. 

Paratendipes albimanus (Meigen) 

Chironomus albimanus Meigen, S3^stematische Beschreibung der Europaischen

Thorax dark brown instead of black as described (Malloch, 1915; 
Townes, 1945). However, the distinctive superior appendage of the 
male genitalia is diagnostic. 

Males: Wing length, range 1.48-1.52; mean 1.49 mm. (4); leg 
ratio 1.33, 1.2 (2); antennal ratio 0.81 (1).

Paratendipes thermopliihis Townes 
Figure 1,6 

Paratendipes thermophilics Townes, Amer. Midi. Nat., vol. 34, p. 31, 1945. 

The superior appendage of the genitalia in this species usually 
appears somewhat abbreviated because of the point being oriented 
dorsally. Figure 1,6, shows a variation in appearance, due to mounting 
technique, where the point of the superior appendage is fully appressed 
on the slide. 

Males: Wing length 1.63, 1.59 mm. (2) ; fore tarsi missing; antennal 
ratio 1.51 (1). 

Material examined: In UCLA: 1 male, Saratoga Springs, Death 
Valley, May 28, 1955; 1 male, Kesting Springs, Inyo Co., May 29, 
1955. 

Paralaiiterborniella subcincta subclncta (Townes) 

Apedilum subcinctum Townes, Amer. Midi. Nat., vol. 34, p. 33, 1945. 

Males: Wing length, range 1.04-2.11; mean 1.48 mm. (61); leg 
ratio, range 0.95-1.36; mean 1.1 (33); antennal ratio, range 0.78-1.9; 
mean 1.28 (39). 

Female: Wing length, range 1.29-1.55; mean 1.39 (7); leg ratio, 
range 1.0-1.17; mean 1.07 (7). 

This is an exceedingly variable species which probably forms a 
North-South cline. The thorax varies from dark brown to black while 
the abdomen presents even greater differences. Some of the abdom- 
inal color patterns by locality are as follows : Davis : Segments 1 an d 
2 entirely dark brown; segments 3 to 5 with a narrow yellowish green 
posterior border, or segments entirely dark with only faintly lighter 
posterior margins. Rio Linda: Anterior half of tergites 1 to 4 brown; 
posterior half pale yellow. Resting Springs, Saratoga Springs, Death 
Valley: Abdomen largely pale green (fading to yellow or pale brown), 
occasionally with dorsum slightly infuscate. 

The anal point of the male genitalia presents much variation due to 
differences in mounting technique. Not infrequently the anal point 
is obscured and in a few instances, particularly if lateral distortion 
has occurred, the point cannot be seen. 

Paralaiiterborniella elachista (Townes) may be a synonym of this 
species. I have examined the type at the U.S. National Museum but 
cannot be certain without additional topotypic material that the 
species actually lacks an anal point. 

Material examined: In Darby: 16 males, 7 females, Rio Linda, 
July 19, Sept. 22, 1957, D. In USNM: 4 males, Lee's Lake, Chat-

Faralauterborniella subcincta alamedensis new subspecies 

Holotype male: USNM 64710, Sunol, Alameda Co., Sept. 9, 1947; 
W. 

Head, thorax, and abdomen entirely blackish brown; palpi, antennae 
and legs concolorous dark brown. Thorax and abdomen with heavy 
silvery pruinosity when viewed obliquely. Prealar bristles 2 (ma} r 
be rubbed) ; dorsolateral bristles in a single row. Scutellum rubbed 
but with punctae of a straight, transverse, anterior row of at least 
12 bristles. Wings pale, anterior veins pale brown. Halteres basally 
infuscate, distally pale. Fore tarsi with a short beard. Abdomen 
heavily pilose. 

Wing length 2.22 mm.; leg ratio 0.96; antennal ratio 2.14. 

The genitalia is indistinguishable from that of P. subcincta sub- 
cincta (Townes). 

Paratypes: In USNM: 3 males, 2 collected with the type. In 
UCLA: 1 at Huntington Beach, Feb. 21, 1950. 

Wing length, range 2.15-2.41; mean 2.32 mm. (3); leg ratio, range 
0.91-1.0; mean 0.96 (3); antennal ratio 2.05, 2.45 (2). 

P. subcincta alamedensis may be distinguished from P. subcincta 
subcincta (Townes) by its darker color, larger size, higher antennal 
ratio and generally lower leg ratio. 

Polypedilum (Polypcdilum) labeculosum (Mitchell) 

Figure 1,c 
Chironovius labeculosum Mitchell, Journ. New York Ent. Soc, vol. 16, p. 14, 1908. 

This species was known only from three females from Hot Springs, 
Arizona. It is separated from all other Nearctic Polypedilum by a 
disconnected spot in cell Cui. The male, described below, is associated 
on the basis of this diagnostic feature. 

Head, thorax and abdomen dark brown. Mesonotum with 2 con- 
spicuous stripes of silvery pruinosity, narrowly separated on midline

and extending back to seutellum. Dorsomedian and dorsolateral 
bristles erect, In a single row. Prealar bristles about 4. Halteres 
white. ScuteUum with 2 transverse rows of erect bristles. Wings 
distinctly spotted similar to P. pardus Townes and P. parntm Townes 
but with a disconnected spot in cell Oui. Femora dark brown with a 
conspicuous preapical white annulus: remainder of legs lighter brown, 
the tibiae with bases somewhat darker. 

Wing length 2.0, 1.89 mm. (2)j leg ratio 1.6 (1); antennal ratio 
1.12 (slide) (1). 

Abdomen with incisures marked by a very thin band of lighter 
color; conspicuously pilose.

narrower and more elongate. 

Material examined: In UCLA: 2 males, Resting Springs, May 30, 
1955. 

Polypedilum (Polypedilum) califoniieum, new species 

Figure l,d 

Holotype male: USXM 64711, Saratoga Springs, Death Valley, 
May 27, 1955. 

Head, thorax, and abdomen blackish brown. Dorsomedial and 
dorsolateral bristles erect, conspicuous, in a single row. Habere 
knob black, pedicel somewhat paler. Wings pale; anal angle obtuse, 
correlated with small size; wing margin fringe quite long. Legs 
beyond coxae infuseate stramineous. 

Wing length, 1.33 mm.; fore tarsi missing; antennal ratio 0.76 
Cslide). 

Genitalia near jloridense Townes but superior and inferior append- 
ages not apically narrowed. Inferior appendage shows reduction of 
bristles to 4 as in jloridt use Townes (5 in paratype). 

Paratype males: In UCLA and USXM: 2 males collected with type. 
Prealar bristles apparently 4. 

Wing length, range 1.18-1.33; mean 1.27 mm. (4); leg ratio 1.66, 
1.62 (2); antennal ratio 0.78 (2). 

This species may be distinguished from P. jloridensc Townes by the 
male genitalia which has the anal point less truncate and the superior 
and inferior appendages scarcely narrowed apically. 

Polypedilum (Polypedilum) subcultellatum, new speeies 

Figure l,e 

Holotype male: USNM 64712, 6 miles east of Orosi, California. 
July S, 1947. 

Head light brown except for basal segment of antenna which is 
whitish. Postocular bristles long and conspicuous, overhanging eyes; 
laterally in a single row, medially becoming doubled. 



CHIRONOMID MIDGES — SUBLETTE 205 

Thorax with a pale yellowish brown ground color; median vittae 
dark brown; lateral vittae and postnotum blackish-brown. Prealar 
bristles about 6; dorsolateral bristles in a double row. Scutellum and 
halteres yellowish white, the former with 2 irregular transverse rows 
of bristles. Fork of Cu distal to r-m; R 2 +3 and Rj slightly but dis- 
tinctly separated at apex. R 4 + 5 and M equidistant, terminating 
slightly before wing apex. Legs light brown, no tarsal beard. 

Wing length 2.GG mm.; leg ratio (.53; antennal ratio 2.0. 

Abdomen light brown; first segment with a thin, slightly oblique 
longitudinal brown line; segments 2 to 5 with the apical one-third 
occupied by a dark brown band; segments 6 to 7 almost completely 
darkened. 

Genitalia of this species is unique among Nearctic Polypedilum in 
having several bristles beyond the base on the superior appendage. 
It is very similar to the European cultellatum Goetghebuer (Goethge- 
buer, 1937). It differs by not having the inferior appendage widened 
and by having the blade of the superior appendage recurved, not 
acute. 

Paratype male: Collected with type (USNM). 

Wing length 2.26 mm.; leg ratio 1.6; antennal ratio 1.83.

Stenochirononius totifiiscus, new species 

Figure 1, / 

Holotype male: USNM 64713, 6 miles east of Orosi, Calif., July 8, 
1947, W. 

Head brown except flageilum which is stramineous and mouthparts 
which are blackish-brown. Thorax dark brown, heavily pollinose 
especially between median and lateral lobes of the mesonotum giving 
it a vittate appearance. Prealar bristles about 5. Dorsolateral bristles 
in a single row anteriorly, becoming staggered posteriorly, giving the 
appearance of a double row. Scutellum somewhat lighter brown 
than the postnotum which is entirely dark brown. Halteres white. 
Wing membrane and veins pale except r-m and f-Cu which are brown. 
Fork of the Cu distinctly distal to r-m. Legs almost uniformly stra- 
mineous except apices of femora which are faintly suffused with brown. 

Wing length 2.44 mm.; leg ratio 1.1; antennal ratio 1.56. 

Abdomen pale greenish white; segments 2 to 3 with a brown band 
on apical 0.13; segment 4 with the brownish band on apical 0.09; seg- 
ment 5 suffused with brown, becoming almost black posteriorly; seg- 
ment 6 almost entirely blackish. 

Genitalia near ductus Townes. 

Paratypes: Two males, collected with type in USNM. 

Wing length 2.37, 2.32 mm. (2); leg ratio 1.16, 1.17 (2); antennal 
ratio 1.51, 1.58 (2). 

Allotype in USNM, Visalia, Calif., July 4, 1947, W. 

As the male except that the thorax is somewhat lighter in color 
and the abdominal segments are uniformly pigmented with each 
segment having a slightly lighter colored apex. 

Wing length 2.85 mm.; leg ratio 1.27. 

This species is very near ductus Townes but differs in lacking a 
central dusky wing band, in having a uniformly darkened postnotum, 
and in having slight differences in the male genitalia.

Stenochironomus colei (Malloch) 

Chironomus colei Malloch, Proc. California Acad. Sci., vol. 9, p. 255, 1919. 

Males: Wing length 2.55 mm. (1); leg ratio 1.17 (1); antennal ratio 
2.4 (1). 

Females: Wing length 3.15 mm. (1); leg ratio 1.3 (1). 

The single female has the hind tibial band as wide as Townes' 
describes for pulchripennis (Coquillett). However, since the basal 
band of color on the wing membrane between C and R is lacking the 
specimen is clearly colei.

Tendipes (Tendipes) attenuatus (Walker) 

Chironomus attenuatus Walker, List of specimens of dipterous insects in the 
British Museum, pt. 1, vol. 1, p. 20, 1848. 

Males: Wing length, range 2.59-4.55; mean 3.59 mm. (51); leg

leg ratio, range 1.24-1.72; mean 1.44 (11). 

Although there is a considerable difference between the figure for 
antennal ratio given by Townes and that presented here, I do not 
consider it to be biologically significant but rather a reflection of the 
few measurements used b}^ Townes.

Tendipes (Wirthiella) modocensis, new species 

Figure \,g 

Holotype male: USNM 64714, inspection station, Alturas, 
Modoc Co., May 15, 1948, stream margin, W. 

Head entirely black; antennal pedicels large, contiguous, thus 
making it impossible to see if frontal tubercles are present or absent. 
Palpi normal, ratio 10:32:25:26. 

Thorax black except small infuscate yellowish pleural area; lightly 
greyish pruinose; mesonotum with 2 inconspicuous tubercles on 
the median line, one at the anterior end of the prescutellar area, the 
other at the posterior, immediately in front of the scutellum; prealar 
bristles about 5; dorsolateral bristles in a single, staggered row; 
haltere knob infuscate yellow, stalk black; scutellum with many strewn

bristles; fore tarsi heavily bearded; legs black except for trochanters, 
which are brownish. 

Wing length 4.07 mill.; leg ratio 1.25; antennal ratio 3.G2. 

Abdomen black; each segment pruinose except apically, heavily 
pilose. 

Female: Unknown. 

This species may be distinguished from all other Nearctic Chir- 
onomini by the elongate, beaklikc superior appendage and the 
extremely widened inferior appendage of the male genitalia.

218 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Paratypes: Eight males, 1 female, collected with holotype and 
allotype, in USNM. 

Males: Wing length, range 2.11-2.41; mean 2.22 mm. (5); leg ratio, 
range 1.07-1.13; mean 1.11 (5); antennal ratio, range 1.8-2.0; mean 
1.88. 

Female: Wing length, 2.29 mm.; leg ratio, 1.19. 

This species most closely resembles T. fuscicornis (Malloch) from 
which it may be distinguished by its black knobbed halteres and 
hairs of the anterior wing veins which are pale and of normal length. 

Subgenus Tribelos Townes, previously under the genus Tanytarsus 
(i.e., Phaenopsectra) , is here considered to be a unit of Tendipes 
(vide Dendy and Sublette, 1959).

This species was highly variable as to size and ratios and, at first 
glance, was made of several populations that approached subspecific 
level. However, a plot of measurements indicated sufficient overlap 
so as to show lack of population isolation necessary for subspecific 
identity.

Tendipes (Cryptochironomus) chaeioala, new species 

Figure 2,b 

Holotype male: USNM 04716, Lee's Ranch, Chatworth, Los 
Angeles, July 25, 1950. 

Head greenish, the color more intensified on the occiput; pedicel of 
the antenna yellowish, flagellum infuscate brown. 

Thorax largely yellowish -brown, the anterior pleural areas pale 
green; prealar bristles 4 to 5; dorsolateral bristles in partial double 
row; halteres yellowish; scutellum pale green with 12 erect bristles in 
a straight transverse row (para type) ; wing membrane with sparce 
macrotrichia at tips of cell R4+5 and M, the hairs in R4+5 extending 
more than half the way to the base; squama well fringed; hind tibial 
combs close together, the inner spine slightly longer than the outer; 
no beard; femora and tibiae stramineous, tarsi darkened, the foretarsi 
more so. 

Wing length 1.85 mm.; leg ratio 1.52; antennal ratio 2.14. 

Abdomen light green. 

Genitalia very similar to potamogeti (Townes) but differs in mode 
of attachment of the anal point and in details of structure of the 
superior appendage. 

Paratypes: In UCLA and USNM: 4 males collected with the 
holotype; 2 males collected at type locality, Aug. 10, 1950; 1 male, 



CHIRONOMID MIDGES — SUBLETTE 221 

Sclma, July 10, 1947, W. In Darby: 1 male, July 15, 1957, 1 male, 
July 8, 1957, 2 males, July 31, 1957, 3 males, Aug. 4, 1958, D. 

Wing length, range 1.77-2.0; mean 1.88 mm. (7); leg ratio, range 
1.47-1.61; mean 1.56 (4); antennal ratio, range 1.97-2.43; mean 
2.24 (6). 

Female: Unknown. 

The presence of space macrotrichia on the wing membrane serves 
to distinguish this species from all other Nearctic Cryptochironomus. 
The male genitalia most closely resembles that of T. potamogeti 
(Townes) but differs in having the lateral bristle of the superior 
appendage more proximal. 

Terulipes (Cryptocliironomns) durbyi, new species 

Figure 2,c 

Holotype male: USNM 64717, Rio Linda, Sacramento Co., July 10, 
1957, D. 

Head pale green becoming brown on clypeus and mouthparts. 
Antennal pedicel blackish brown, flagellum and plumes pale brown. 
Thoracic ground color pale green; vittae, mesosternum, a small spot 
on pleura ventral and slightly anterior to wing bases, and posterior 
half of postnotum blackish brown, strongly contrasting with the 
ground color; anterior end of median and posterior end of later;!! 
darker brown than remainder of vittae. Prealar bristles 2 ; dorsolateral 
bristles in a single row; scutellum with a transverse row of 6 pale, 
erect bristles; halteres pale green. Wings milky by reflected, brown 
by transmitted light; squamal fringe with about 8 hairs (paratype). 
Legs pale green; fore leg entirely dusky beyond middle of femur; 
middle and hind legs dusky only on tarsi. 

Wing length 2.5 mm.; leg ratio 1.27; antennal ratio 2.5. 

Abdominal segments 1 to 4 pea green becoming dark brown on 
segments 5 to 8 (paratype). 

Genitalia very similar to that of T. ariel, new species but less 
massive. 

Female: Unknown. 

Paratypes: In USNM: 2 males, Stratford, July 8, 1947; 1 male, 
collected with the type. In Darby: 1 male, Davis, July 3, 1957, D. 
In UC, Davis: 1 male, Davis, June 8, 1958, J. C. Hall. 

Wing length, range 1.55-1.74; mean 1.68 mm. (4); leg ratio, range 
1.34-1.4; mean 1.37 (3) ; antennal ratio, range 2.6-2.82; mean 2.71 (4). 

This species with its dusky fore legs and its distinctive genitalia 
can only be confused with T. {Cryptochironomus) ariel, new species. 
T. darbyi can be separated by its smaller size, lighter color, smaller 
antennal ratio and different genitalia. 

I am happy to name this species after R. E. Darby. 



222 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Tendipes (Cryptochironomns) ariel, new species 

Figure 2,d 

Holotype male: USNM 64718, Topaz Lake, Mono Co., June 5, 
1948, W. 

Head, thorax and abdomen blackish-brown with a faint suggestion 
of a dark olive green ground color. Dorsolateral bristles in a single 
row; prealar bristles about 5. Haltere kuob whitish, pedicel blackish- 
brown. Wings somewhat milky by reflected light, brownish-purple 
by transmitted light; squama with 10-12 bans. Legs dark brown; 
basal one-third of femora somewhat paler; fore tarsi heavily bearded. 

Wing length 2.59 mm.; leg ratio 1.37; antennal ratio 3.47. 

Abdomen heavily pilose, the long hairs arising from very distinct 
alveoli. 

Genitalia: The shape of the ninth tergite as figured for T. darbyi 
and this species would indicate a distinctiveness which is not real, as 
is shown by intermediates in the paratypic series of this species. 
The difference is interpreted as a variation in mounting technique. 

Female: Unknown. 

Paratypes: Five males collected with the holotype (USNM). 

Wing length, range 2.41-2.74; mean 2.6 mm. (5); leg ratio, range 
1.24-1.46; mean 1.37 (5); antennal ratio, range 3.17-3.5; mean 3.34 (5). 

Of the Nearctic fauna, this species can be confused only with T. 
darbyi, new species. The two species may ultimately prove to be 
extremes of a clinal series. However, in the absence of individuals with 
intermediate characteristics the two are considered separate species. 

Tendipes (Cryptochironomus) alpJiaeus, new species 

Figure 2,e 

Holotype male: USNM 64719, King's River Canyon, July 20, 
1947, W. 

Head and most of thorax dark brown; anterior pleural areas, spaces 
between vittae and scutellum somewhat paler; mesonotum and anten- 
nal pedicel heavily dusted with greenish-gray pollen; halteres whitish, 
base somewhat infuscate; squama with at least 3 hairs; middle and 
hind tibiae each with 2 spurs; legs stramineous, knees somewhat 
darker. 

Wing length 1.92 mm.; leg ratio 1.64; antennal ratio 1.8. 

Abdomen brown with a dark olive green tinge; incisures slightly 
darker; apical segments progressively darkened to a dark brown. 

Genitalia very similar to undine (Townes) but differing in having a 
more spatulate anal point, a superior appendage of a slightly different 
shape and orientation and an inferior appendage which is shorter 
and broader.

REVISION OF THE MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA 
(POLYDESMIDA : XYSTODESMIDAE) 



By Richard L. Hoffman 1 



Introduction 



The student of humus fauna who pursues field work in the circum- 
Appalachian region of southeastern United States cannot help but be- 
come impressed with the abundance and variability of millipeds of the 
genus Ckerokia. It is a well-marked ensemble of xystodesmids which 
in many areas is the most conspicuous element of the diplopod fauna. 
Besides the interest engendered by the broad ecological tolerance and 
geographic variability of its forms, Cherokia has a still more compelling 
claim upon our attention, for despite the diversity of body form, color 
pattern, and morphological details which occurs in the genus, the male 
gonopods remain essentially similar. 

Generally, species in xystodesmid genera tend to be remarkably 
similar in external body form, specific individuality being expressed 
solely in the gonopods, which often assume bizarre shapes of great 
specific constancy. Cherokia represents an apparent departure from 
this condition, and in working out the s^'stematics of this genus one 
faces the problem whether to assume the occurrence of heteromorphic 
species — with external differentiation in body form at the expense of 
the normally variable gonopods — or a single highly variable species 
within the genus. 

'This paper was written while the author was affiliated with the Biology Department, Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, Virginia.

Solution of this difficulty involves more than merely clarifying sys- 
tematics and phylogeny within the small confines of Cherokia, and 
will provide insight into the problem of coping with related genera 
composed of heteromorphic "species" held together by a constant 
gonopod structure. The ultimate challenge in this direction is the 
large neotropical genus Bhysodesmus, already with about 80 named 
forms despite only desultory collecting in the region it occupies. 

The considerable quantity of material of Cherokia now at hand from 
a large number of localities facilitates a fairly thorough examination 
of speciation and geographic variation in diplopod genera character- 
ized by basically uniform gonopod structure. It is hoped that the 
following account will be of interest and value to other investigators 
who find pleasure and reward in unraveling the intricacies inherent 
in this neglected class of arthropods. 

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 

Apparently the first specimens of this genus to be collected were 
obtained in Georgia by L. M. Underwood. During the summer of 
1887, he secured material at Macon, Lookout Mountain, Indian 
Springs, and Tallulah, and two years later Charles H. Bollman de- 
scribed from it two species referable to Cherokia. These were Fon- 
taria georgiana, based on numerous specimens from Piedmont locali- 
ties, and Font aria tallulah, the types of which are two immature 
females from Tallulah Falls on the edge of the Blue Ridge province. 
Bollman recognized the similarity of these two species in most respects 
and made the separation between them primarily on the basis of 
differences in the color patterns. 

Kemarkably enough, no further information on the genus was 
published for 50 years. In 1939, R. V. Chamberlin described material 
from Soco Gap, North Carolina, under the name Mimuloria ducilla, 
and followed it a year later with the closely related Mimuloria furcifer. 
These names were considered to be synonyms of georgiana by H. F. 
Loomis (1943), who had seen Bollman 's types and felt that only a 
single form was involved. Under the name Dynoria parvior, Cham- 
berlin (1947) described another local population of Cherokia from 
north Georgia and compared it only with Dynoria icana although the 
two species clearly are not congeneric. This fact was pointed out 
in a subsequent paper by Loomis and Hoffman (1948), who considered 
parvior to be a junior synonym of georgiana. 

For a decade, specimens belonging to this genus were referred to 
Mimuloria (Chamberlin, 1928) although the type species, M. mis- 
souriensis Chamberlin, had never been described sufficiently to give 
any idea of its attributes. Finally in 1949 Chamberlin set up the 
new genus Cherokia and designated Fontaria georgiana Bollman as 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 229 

the type species, but he did not stipulate which other names belonged 
in Cherokia. 

During the summer of 1949, I acquired considerable field experience 
with Cherokia in the southern Appalachians. In a paper appearing 
the following year, I discussed variation and distribution in the genus 
and concluded that of the five which had been proposed, only a single 
specific name was valid. This synonymy was based on topotypes of 
tallulah and ducilla, specimens from near the type locality of furcifer, 
and Bollman's types of both tallulah and georgiana. No attempt was 
made to consider the general problem of geographic variation over 
the entire range. But in subsequent years, with the acquisition of 
rich collections made in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee by Leslie 
Hubricht, I found it necessary to review the status of the genus, and 
the outcome of the investigation is presented in the following paper. 

MATERIALS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

The material studied is included in more than 105 lots and totals 
well over 400 individuals. Probably 95 percent of these are in my 
personal collection (RLH), thanks to the kindness of many friends who 
have picked up millipeds incidental to their own line of special interest. 
Specimens have also been examined in the following collections: 
American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), New York City, 
Chicago Natural History Museum (CNIIM), Chicago; and U.S. 
National Museum (USNM), Washington, D.C. 

The type specimens of Fontaria georgiana and F. tallulah of Bollman 
are in the U.S. National Museum and have been studied. Topotypes 
of tallulah, Mimuloria ducilla, and M. furcifer have been seen in life 
and have provided an idea of the basis of those three names. 
Specimens collected less than 20 miles from the type locality of 
Dynoria parvior, while not strictly topotypical, are nonetheless 
representative of the population described under that name and make 
its evaluation possible with considerable confidence. 

Methods of study outlined in previous papers have been followed 
and need no repetition here. Because of the confused state of nomen- 
clature in the genus, all previously published information was rejected 
as prejudicial. Specific characters and the distribution of populations 
thus defined were worked out at the beginning; only after this work 
had been done was the application of available names undertaken. 

Particular attention has been paid to the evaluation and comparison 
of localized populations in order to determine geographic variation. 
In this respect, likewise, each of the structural variables found useful 
in diagnosis has been separately plotted cartographieally. These 
precautions have been found useful in light of the remarkably uniform 
gonopod structure in all of the specimens, a condition which compelled 
my giving attention to details of body form.

The pronounced geographic variation in color pattern obtaining 
in Cherokia imposes a higher premium on knowledge of the living 
colors in this genus than in most other. Much of the material of C. 
georgiana latassa — with which I have had little field experience — was 
sent to me by Leslie Hubricht soon after collection, with the colors 
still fresh. Of C. g. georgiana and C. g. ducilla, which intergrade exten- 
sively, I have been most fortunate in being able to collect living 
specimens at more than 30 localities, chiefly through two summers 
of residence at the Highlands Biological Station. This first-hand 
knowledge of subtle color details has facilitated numerous inferences 
about microevolution which could never be made from faded speci- 
mens. Most of the work with color characters was done during the 
summer of 1958 through the aid of a National Science Foundation 
grant administered by the Highlands Station. Special thanks are 
due its director, Professor Thelma Howell, for her continued interest 
and material aid during the past decade of my summer investigations 
at Highlands. 

For the loan of material, I am indebted to Dr. Ralph E. Crabill, 
Jr. (USNM), Dr. Willis J. Gertsch (AMNH), and Drs. Henry S. 
Dybas and Rupert L. Wenzel (CNHM). Those who have generously 
donated specimens are named in the lists of material examined, 
but special mention must be made of the outstanding contribution 
of Leslie Hubricht, whose superb collections form the basis of this 
revision. 

TAXONOMIC CHARACTERS 

The most casual inspection of Cherokia specimens from different 
parts of the generic range reveals a remarkable amount of geographic 
variation in bod} 7 form, shape of the paranota, color pattern, and de- 
tails of the gonopods. In addition, there is considerable individual 
or sporadic local variation in tergal sculpture, convexity of the dorsum, 
shape of the caudalmost paranota, and size of the coxal and prefemoral 
spines, but these low order variations may for the present be subordina- 
ted in favor of those which are correlated to some extent with dis- 
tribution. Although clear cut and easily defined, such characters are 
by no means easy to analyze. As will become apparent, only infre- 
quently do we find that two or more characters coincide, a fact which 
renders their utility in the recognition of taxonomic groups somewhat 
subjective. 

Body form: Perhaps the most striking variation observed in 
Cherokia is in body form — e.g., the ratio of greatest width to length. 
Specimens from the Great Smokies are so different from lowland ani- 
mals in this respect that without knowledge of the intermediates which 
occur, one would naturally assume full specific distinction. The 
narrow graceful body of a specimen from the Smokies is in strong con-

trast to the broad robust form occuring in north Georgia, as can be 
seen from the accompanying photograph (see plate 1) of two speci- 
mens typical of the extremes in this variable character. 

Determination of relative body width is by no means a precise 
operation, yet by uniform measuring techniques the error is held to a 
minimum. Naturally only well-preserved specimens can be used, 
with the body lying flat and straight, and not noticeably telescoped. 
In this position nearly all specimens have the first few segments a 
little arched (due to the curling reflex) and the collum declined at an 
angle of about 45 degrees. Efforts to reduce this arching usually 
result in either breaking the specimen or unduly extending the front 
end. Measurements have been made with vernier-scale calipers, 
length to an accuracy of 0.5 mm. and width to 0.1 mm. The greatest 
width normally occurs at the midbody segments but may be further 
caudad. The width was in every case checked by moving the calipers 
along the body until the widest segment was located. 

The simple ratio of width divided by length yields a value which 
ranges from 19 to 28 percent. At any given locality from which a 
series of measurements is available, the range of variation in this 
ratio is not over 3 percent, and this magnitude is almost certainly due 
to the errors inherent in measuring the length of preserved specimens. 
Nonetheless, the mean value of the w/l ratio, plotted cartographi- 
cally from as many samples as possible, produces an interesting sort 
of distributional pattern. Figure 1 is a map reflecting geographic 
variation in body form, the isophenes inclosing populations the mean 
w/l ratio of which falls within the specified limits. 

From this map, it is seen that broad specimens with a ratio of 26 per- 
cent or more occur over most of the generic range, chiefly but not 
exclusively in low country. In the high ranges of the Great Smokj^- 
Unaka Mountains the ratio is less than 24 percent, while populations 
with intermediate values (24 to 26 percent) occupy a large part of 
southwestern North Carolina in the Cowee, Nantahala, and Balsam 
ranges. 

It has been found desirable to rely largely upon ratios derived from 
male specimens, these generally being in greater supply and usually 
easier to flatten and measure. A large number of females were stud- 
ied, however, and these show a certain amount of sexual dimorphism 
in being slightly wider at any given locality than the males, the w/l 
ratio of the females being about 1 percent higher. 

Shape of paranota: Close examination of the lateral projections of 
the metazonitcs shows the occurrence of two rather distinct forms. 
In one of these forms (fig. 3,a), the paranotal scapulorae (new term, 
from the Latin "scapula," a shoulder, and "ora," the rim of a shield) 
as seen in dorsal aspect are strictly marginal; that is, they form the

anterior rim of the paranota on all segments. The other form (fig.

paranotal shoulder and are submarginal in position, with a consider- 
able portion of the cephalic face of the paranota visible below and hi 
front of them as seen in dorsal aspect. The map (fig. 2) shows the 
distribution of these two structural variants, which are apparently 
largely complementary. 

In the occurrence of two discrete paranotal types we find a situation 
not hitherto observed in the xystodesmid genera studied in detail, 
although a similar relationship may occur in the related genera Rhyso- 
desmus and Boraria, both of which are known to be highly variable in 
general body form. 






MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 233 

Shape of solenomerite of gonopods: In Cherokia the male gono- 
pod (fig. 4,a) is superficially bifid distally. This impression is created 
by a subtriangular, retrorse solenomerite (SLM) and a normally smaller 
subapical spur. Examination of the gonopods under considerable 
magnification reveals that in the mountains of North Carolina there 
is a tendency for the solenomerite to become elongated with evenly 
converging sides (fig. 4,/), while over most of the remainder of the gen- 
eric range, the solenomerite is much shorter and frequently somewhat 
curved, with one margin convex and the other concave (fig. 4,e). Un- 
fortunately this variation is not as constant as might be wished; its 
distribution is fraught with exceptions and intermediate forms. 

Occurrence of tibiotarsal marginal spur: In most specimens 
of Cherokia the coxal margin of the tibiotarsus is provided with a dis- 
tinct acute spur of varying size (fig. 4,6, TTS) . In the Great Smokies, 
the spur is typically absent in all specimens. Southward, the per- 
centage of absence decreases to 88 at Soco Gap in the Balsams, 68 in 
the Cowees, 12 in the Nantahalas, 44 around Highlands, North Caro- 
lina, and 36 at Brasstown Bald, Georgia. Throughout the remainder 
of the generic range, the spin- is absent in less than 25 percent of the 
specimens examined. 

The inference to be drawn from these phenomena is that the spin- 
is occasionally absent in most of the populations of Cherokia, but 
becomes progressively suppressed in the southern end of the Blue 
Ridge and totally so in the Smokies. 

Variation in color pattern : Modifications of color pattern in ( Ik ro- 
kia are numerous and complex, and full appreciation of such charact ers 
can be had only through knowledge of living colors. This informa- 
tion is available at least for the critical region of the western Carolinas 
and north Georgia, and permits some inferences on evolution and 
migration routes in the mountainous region where the genus is, 
structurally least stable. The different patterns may be classified 
roughly as follows : 

A. Bimaculate, no median row of spots 

B. Trimaculate 

1. Small median spots 

2. Broad median spots 

C. Banded 

1. Red bands superimposed on the trimaculate phase 

2. Bands formed by very wide median spots 

3. Complete, characteristically wide crossbands. 

There is a sort of progression represented by this breakdown, from 
A through Bl, B2, and C2 to C3. Normally, however, each group is 
isolated geographically. 

Bimaculation has been observed only in one sample, a small series 
from Lee County, Alabama, on the southern periphery of the generic 



234 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

range. Freshly preserved material showed only the yellow paranotal 
spots, with no trace of any median spots. However, the probable 
derivation of this phase from the normal trimaculate pattern can be 
inferred from a large series (35 specimens) from a single locality in 
Transylvania County, North Carolina, on the extreme northeastern 
edge of the range. Here there is a strong tendency for the median 
spots to diminish in size, especially anteriorly. The characteristics 
of this series are summarized as follows : 

Condition Males Females 

Collura immaculate 1 

Collum with anterior spot only 4 

Collum with large anterior and very small posterior spot .... 3 7 

2nd segment without median spot 3 

2nd and 3d segments without median spot 2 

Collum and following segments with small but distinct spots . 7 7 

Immature specimens taken at the same time and place are rather 
typical of last-stadium forms of the genus; that is, they have moder- 
ately large and distinct median spots, a fact permitting the inference 
that departure from the trimaculate condition is an evolutionary 
specialization. 

Broad median spots, usually lunate or crescentic in form, occur at 
various places in the range but are most characteristic of the popula- 
tions in the Smokies, Balsams, and Unakas. Here the spots are up to 
50 percent of the width of the segments, and in some females nearly 
or actually touch the paranotal spots. The same general pattern 
recurs in the Kentucky segment of the Cherokia population. 

The pattern characteristic of the population in much of the western 
Carolinas and adjoining states is that of small yellow paranotal spots, 
with yellow median sub triangular spots of equal size. This pattern 
has been seen in the Blue Ridge of South Carolina and Georgia, in 
the Nantahalas and Cowees of North Carolina, and in the ranges 
west of the Unakas in southeast Tennessee. 

An interesting variation in the pattern occurs in a restricted area 
of the Blue Ridge. In this phase the three yellow spots of each seg- 
ment are connected by a transverse chestnut or reddish band, the 
intensity of which increases adjacent to the yellow spots and produces 
a most attractive effect. In addition, the legs of this form are pink 
instead of the typical yellow. Such specimens have been found at 
four localities: on Chatooga Ridge, north of Mountain Rest, South 
Carolina; the gorge of the Chatooga River south of Cashiers, North 
Carolina; around Highlands, North Carolina; and at Walnut Creek 
Gap in the Cowee Range, 8 miles northwest of Highlands. At all of 
these places, this variation occurs along with the typical form. None 
has been found beyond this limited range, a condition shown by the 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 235 

light stipple in figure 6. Altitudinally the variation ranges from about 
1,500 feet at Chatooga Ridge to 4,800 feet at Walnut Creek Gap. 

Crossbands formed by lateral prolongation of the median spots are 
characteristic of the majority of the Chcrokia population over Georgia, 
Alabama, and a part of Tennessee. In this phase the band is widest 
at the middorsal line and pinches somewhat at the base of the paranota. 

True crossbands, transversely parallel and rather broad, occur at 
widely separated localities and doubtless represent the end product 
of local specialization. In the extreme northwest, on the western 
Highland Rim of Tennessee, occurs a form with bands almost half as 
wide as the length of the metazonite and deep red in color. This 
population clearly derives from adjacent forms to the southeast, 
which are trimaculate with red or chestnut, but a good picture of the 
situation cannot be gained at the present with the few available 
collections from northwest Alabama. 

Of more immediate interest is the independent recurrence of a 
yellow-banded form at two isolated places in the southern Blue Ridge. 
One of these occupies the northwestern end of the Cowee Range in 
Macon and Jackson counties, North Carolina. In this region, river 
valleys do not constitute formidable barriers to gene flow, but the 
intercalated mountain ranges afford by their height something anala- 
gous to the effects of insular isolation, local populations normally 
attaining greatest differentiation and stability at higher elevations. 
The Cherokia occurring on Cowee Bald (elevation 4,800 feet) is a 
striking animal — glossy black with broad lemon-yellow crossbands 
and legs — and the population there seems to be a homogeneous one. 
Cowee Bald is set off from the rest of the range by a rather low gap 
just northeast of Franklin, North Carolina, but the development of 
its local form is presaged by the occasional collection of similar 
appearing individuals as far to the southeast as Highlands, North 
Carolina. 

Snould local populations in this genus ever be considered as eligible 
for subspecific names (a course which is avoided at the present writ- 
ing), the Cowee population would seem at first to be an outstanding 
contender for a name. But its claim is challenged by an identical 
population which lias developed in Cades Cove, on the western base 
of the Smokies in Blount County, Tennessee. In this case the 
transition from the trimaculate population to the south is seen in a 
collection from the southern edge of Cades Cove, containing both 
forms and one intermediate. This banded population is, in a sense, 
as isolated as its counterpart on Cowee Bald, for although it is geo- 
graphically contiguous to the northeast with the narrow-bodied form 
of the Great Smokies, it seems very unlikely that gene flow takes 
place between them. In addition to the difference in size and pro- 

540228—60—2 



236 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

portions of the two, they are separated by a considerable difference 
in elevation. 

Aside from the variation in dorsal coloration, there is some local 
differentiation in the pigmentation of other parts. Normally the legs 
and underparts of Cherokia are yellow, but in the Smokies the pleural 
regions and anal valves become nearly black; in the vicinity of High- 
lands, North Carolina, the legs may be pink instead of yellow. In 
xystodesmids generally, the legs assume the same color as the para- 
nota and are brightest on the distal joints — -those which extend 
beyond the paranota when the animal is walking, a coloration giving 
the impression of much greater body width. 

Evaluation of characters: From the preceding accounts, one 
can draw several inferences. To begin with , five characters have been 
detected which seem to vary significantly with respect to the spatial 
distribution of the genus. As a complicating factor, in only a few 
cases do any of the variational phases coincide in any given region, 
and at least one character — color pattern- — is subject to a great 
amount of localized regional variation, sometimes three separate color 
phases occurring together. What significance is to be assigned to 
these structural variations in the definition of taxonomic categories? 

Of the five characters, one is represented by two quite different 
forms, which are geographically exclusive in their distribution (fig. 2). 
This character is the structure of the paranotal scapulorae. Most of 
the specimens seen so far fall readily into one category or the other 
and make a strong case for full specific value. There is, however, some 
evidence suggesting that the geographic and morphologic gaps between 
these two populations are more apparent than real, something to be 
discussed under a subsequent heading (page 258). There is reason to 
believe that intergradation between the two populations occurs in 
extreme western Georgia, an area from which no material was avail- 
able. Since other structural characters in the genus, such as male 
gonopods, size, body form, and color pattern, transgress the boundary 
between the paranotal types, the latter are considered as diagnostic 
of a wide-ranging western subspecies of Cherokia georgiana, rather 
than of a different species. 

Of the various names which have been based upon specimens of 
Cherokia, all apply to the form characterized by submarginal scapu- 
lorae. Of them, the oldest available name is Bollman's Fontaria 
georgiana, proposed for specimens from Macon and Tallulah, Georgia. 
To the best of my knowledge, there is no name available for the popu- 
lation of Tennessee and Alabama with marginal scapulorae, and a new 
one is herein proposed. 

The latter is quite uniform over its range with respect to body form, 
but the distribution of the more eastern georgiana includes specimens

ranging from 20 to 28 percent in the ratio of body width to length 
(fig. 1). Over most of this area, comprising the northern half of 
Georgia and the western part of South Carolina, the ratio is fairly 
stable at 26-28 percent, but as the species invades the high country of 
the Blue Ridge, there is a striking tendency toward a narrowed body 
form with much lower w/l ratios, the trend culminating in the high 
reaches of the Unicoi and Great Smoky Mountains. Even with this 
clinal variation, however, one can utilize the fact that the change from 
the normal broad body to the unusually narrow form occurs over a 
relatively small area, and that the narrow form maintains itself as a 
stable unit in a region where several other characters likewise attain 
their strongest development. Despite the great dissimilarity of the 



238 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

extremes, there is an area of intermediate types, and body form can be 
given a value no higher than that of a subspecific character. 

Nearly the same summary can be made concerning the distribution 
of the tibiotarsal spur of the gonopod, which becomes obliterated in 
a more or less sporadic fashion throughout the range of the species 
georgiana, but which is invariably wanting in the region occupied by 
the slender-bodied subspecies. From a normal absence of about 
25 percent in most of the generic range, the tibiotarsal spur is absent 
from 36 percent of a sample from Towns County, Georgia, from 44 
percent of the population around Highlands, North Carolina, and 
from 66 percent of specimens collected in the Cowee Mountains. It 
is missing in 100 percent of the millipeds from the Great Smokies. 
Here is a case of variational coincidence which certainly reinforces the 
desirability of recognizing the slender-bodied population as sub- 
specifically distinct. 

The variation of color pattern hardly needs review. The tendency 
for localized color races is pronounced, and if subspecies were recog- 
nized on this basis alone, one could name about eight. Since most 
such populations would not correlate with groupings made on more 
fundamental structural bases, it is felt that in Cherokia, at least, no 
practical ends would be served by the wholesale application of names 
to color forms. This view is particularly true when we recall that one 
distinctive phase has arisen independently at two different and widely 
separated localities, and that elsewhere two or more color phases 
occur together both typically and with various intermediate forms. 

At only one place does a color pattern phase coincide with other 
local structural divergence — again in the Smokies, where, for instance, 
the typical pale color of the pleurites is replaced by dark burnished 
brown or dilute black. The combination of at least three distinct 
localized character variants makes it impossible to discount the import- 
ance of evolution in this region, even though all the characters merge 
into the more typical phases of C. g. georgiana by gradual gradations, 
which however do not progress at the same rates of modification. 

In summary, working with geographic variation in paranotal form, 
body proportions, and coloration, we can divide Cherokia into three 
mutually exclusive populations, a partition which is supported by such 
other characters such as those of the gonopods and cyphopods (fig. 5). 
However, either direct or presumptive evidence indicates that all 
these populations merge where their ranges meet, and should be re- 
garded as geographic races of a single species, Cherokia georgiana 
(Bollman.) One is recognizable by a very distinct modification of the 
paranota which holds uniform over a rather extensive geographic 
range. The other two, which share another paranotal form, differ 
from each other in three or four characters. The lowland population 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 239 

of Georgia carries the name of the nominate subspecies. That which 
occurs in the Great Smokies may be recognized as the third subspecies. 
A name is already available for this form, ducilla Chamberlin, based on 
specimens from Soco Gap, North Carolina. 

Genus Cherokia Chamberlin 

Cherokia Chamberlin, 1949, p. 3. — Hoffman, 1950, p. 23. — Chamberlin and Hoff- 
man, 1958, p. 26. 

Type species: Fontaria georgiana Bollman 1889, by original 
designation. 

Diagnosis: A genus of moderate-size, compact xystodesinids of 
variable form and appearance, with the following characters in 
common: 

Head smooth and polished, vertigial groove evident but not termi- 
nating in a shallow depression. Facial setae as follows: four supra- 
antennal, two interantennal, two subantennae, and two frontal setae. 
Genae almost flat, without median depressions, their ends not surpass- 
ing margin of cranium. Antennae long and slender, articles 2-6 
subequal in size and shape, with four sensory cones. 

Body shape variable, either broad (the width up to 28 percent of 
length) or very narrow (as little as 19 percent of length), depending 
upon width of paranota. The latter slightly interrupting slope of 
dorsum, their dorsal surface coriaceous, the lateral edges smooth and 
rounded, pores opening dorsally in elongate pj^riform peritremata, 
the pore formula normal. 

Sterna smooth and glabrous, forming a gradually inclined podoster- 
num between the legs, this area divided by a transverse groove, and 
produced into small conicles at the base of each leg; pleural regions 
smooth and unmodified. Sterna of 4th and 5th segments of males 
with low rounded knobs between the legs. 

Coxae of male gonopods moderate size, cylindrical, attached to a 
wealdy sclerotized but distinct sternite; lacking apical apophyses or 
other modifications, socket of solenite well removed from the distal 
margin. Telopodite attached to coxite at a right angle, extending 
cephalad between legs of 6th segment, the two gonopods parallel with 
the distal ends usually in contact; prefemora elongate, tapering distad, 
densely setose mesiall}', with a short simple acicular prefemoral proc- 
ess. Remainder of telopodite set off from prefemur by a conspicuous, 
flexible, cingulum but continuing in the same axis, distally with a 
short falcate process (here provisionally regarded as tibia) projecting 
mesiad from the mesial margin and with two terminal tarsal processes, 
a slender parasolenomerite from the upper margin, and a short recurved 
solenomerite from the lower. 



240 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Gonopod aperture very wide, almost diamond-shaped prozonite; 
of 7th segment reduced to a mere thin transverse vestige in front of the 
aperture. 

Cyphopods (fig. 5) very strongly compressed, the inner valve much 
smaller than the outer; receptacle completely lost, a detail which 
separates Cherokia from all other xystodesmid genera. Epigynal re- 
gion not differentiated or modified. 

Range: Southeastern United States, in the Piedmont, southern 
section of the Blue Ridge Province, and the Cumberland Plateau. 
All of western North Carolina south of the French Broad River, 
extreme western South Carolina, the northern half of Georgia and 
Alabama, most of the Cumberland Plateau as well as the Valley and 
Ridge Province south of the French Broad River in Tennessee, and 
extreme southeastern Kentucky (Harlan, Bell, and Laurel Counties). 

Species: One, Cherokia georgiana (Bollman), with three subspecies, 
separable by the contrasts stipulated in the key given below.

Figure 3. — Structural details of Cherokia: a and upper part of c, dorsal and caudal aspects 
of a midbody segment of Cherokia georgiana latassa from Jackson Co., Alabama; b and 
lower part of c, the same views of C. g. ducilla from Soco Gap, North Carolina; d,

ing sternal spines, bases of legs, and hypoproct. Abbreviations: Hyp., hypoproct; 
Oz, ozopore; Pt, peritreme; and Sc, scapulora. 

Diagnosis: A broad, flat subspecies (w/l 26-28 percent) of Cherokia 
georgiana of which the scapulorae are submarginal and expose the an- 
terior face of the paranota. 

Description: Two male specimens from Banks County, Georgia, 
were compared with the holotype and are virtually identical with it. 
A broad, compact, robust form, the width/length ratio from 26 to 
28 percent, paranota only slightly depressed from the horizontal and 
interrupting slope of the slightly convex dorsum. Metazonites of 
segments 5-16 of essentially full width (8.5-9.5 mm.); width of colhim 
about 7.0 mm. 

Head capsule normal in appearance, oval, convex, smooth and pol- 
ished. Setae of vertex 2-2, forming a strongly procuTved row with 
the innermost seta of each pair set a little lower on the vertex than the 
outer, the space between the pairs greater than the distance between 



242 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

the setae of each. Two narrowly separated setae in the isthmus be- 
tween the antennae, and another pan of more widely separated setae 
at the level of the lower edge of the sockets. A pair of widely spaced 
frontal setae, and a submarginal row of three closely set setae on the 
lower part of each gena. Clypeal setae long and closely set, in a row 
of 30 or more; labral setae equally long but wider spaced, about 20 in 
the series. Genae not margined, nearly flat, with only a vague me- 
dian depression; the ends broadly rounded and not surpassing adjacent 
margin of cranium. 

Antennae long (8-9 mm.) and slender, reaching back to caudal mar- 
gin of 3d segment. Article 1 broadest, short, cylindrical, glabrous. 
Articles 2-6 subequal in size and shape, each slightly clavate. Article 
7 very short, slightly conical, the distal edge not in turned between the 
4 small widely separated sensory cones. Antennae nearly glabrous 
proximally (the setae of article 2 mostly on the ventral side), becoming 
increasingly invested distally, the setae of article 6 very numerous, 
long, and procumbent. 

Collum broad, smooth or finely coriaceous, its caudal edge almost 
transverse. Lateral thirds of the anterior edge strongly curved caudo- 
laterad and strongly margined, forming a bluntly acute angle with the 
posterior edge. Lateral ends of collum not exceeding width of follow- 
ing segments. 

Tergites of body segments smooth medially, becoming increasingly 
coriaceous on the paranota, especially toward the end of the bod} 7 . 
Paranota slightly depressed, inclined cephaloventrad, much longer 
than median length of the metatergites. Caudal edges of paranota 
directed caudolaterad on all segments posterior to 4th, becoming in- 
creasingly angular caudad; paranota of segment 18 forming al- 
most true isosceles triangles, the apices pointing directly caudad. 
Paranota of segment 19 forming blunt lobes including only half the 
length of the epiproct. 

Caudal edges of paranota not margined, lateral ends set off as elon- 
gate, nearly parallel-sided peritremata (fig. 3,6, PT), the pores opening 
dorsally near cephalic end of swelling, at about the midlength of the 
paranota. Anterior to the pore, the peritreme is extended forward as 
a strong, high marginal ridge (the scapulora), its free edge reflexed 
caudad over the deeply impressed paranoial surface just behind. In 
dorsal aspect the scapulorae extend in an irregular line directly mesiad 
from the scapular convexity, and reveal the anterior face of the 
paranotum sloping downward At juncture with the body cylinder 
the scapulorae are so strongly reflexed caudad as to become appressed 
and merged with the dorsum. 

No distinct interzonal furrow present, the surface of metazonites 
somewhat lower than that of prozonites, which it meets at a sharply 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 243 

defined fault line. Dorsolateral rugosity of metazonites not carried 
over onto prozonites, which are completely smooth. Aside from cori- 
aceous texture, the metazonites are provided with minute setiferous 
tubcrcules, most conspicuous posteriorly, which tend to form three 
irregular transverse rows. The caudalmost of these rows normally 
consist of about 22 (up to 28 in some cases) tubercules, three widely 
separated near the caudal paranotal edge, and 14 to 16 set much closer 
across the dorsum itself. The other two rows are less regular in num- 
ber and distribution, the widely spaced tubercules ranging from 10 to 
about 16. 

Epiproct evenly conical in dorsal aspect, its surface mostly smooth 
except for some basal striations and distinct setiferous tubercules, the 
appex decurvcd slightly and bearing four terminal compound setae. 
Peripheral areas of disc of anal valves vertically costate, the median 
area elevated and smooth, with a single paramedian setiferous socket. 
Free edges of valves produced into distinct marginal swellings, becoming 
thicker upwards, the point of greatest breadth including the marginal 
seta. Hypoproct a broadly oval plate (fig. 3,(1), the surface smooth 
and unmodified, paramedian apical setae widely separated from each 
other and well removed from the caudal margin of plate. Apical 
projection very small or wanting. 

Pleural areas unmodified, surface finely granular except for the 
caudal edge, which is set off as a depressed, smooth, parallel-sided 
margin, the edge strongly sigmoidally curved ventrad, ending on dorsal 
curve of coxal socket. Interzonal furrow more definitely formed down 
sides and across venter. 

Sternal areas smooth and glabrous, tending to form a raised area 
(podosternum) between the legs but this area sloping gradually 
cephalad to the interzonal furrow. Each podosternum divided by 
a vague transverse groove which becomes accentuated laterally where 
it is prececded by a low conical knob formed by the sternum at the 
base of the anterior leg pair. Sternum between posterior leg pair 
projecting shelflike caudad, its margin transverse except for the 
strongly produced corners, which become increasingly larger and more 
acute back to the 18th segment (fig. S,d). Sternum of 7th segment 
flat, without subcoxal spines or very low ones. Midbody legs sepa- 
rated by a distance up to 2.5 mm., equalling or exceeding length of 
prefemur. Sternum of 4th segment of male produced into two low 
rounded knobs between the legs, anterior leg pair of 5th segment 
separated by two larger, more transverse, and cephalically directed 
processes. Sternum of 6th segment broad, flat, unmodified. 

Legs long, those of midbody segments up to 9.0 mm., the 
joints in decreasing order of length, 3-6-2-5-4-1. The basal two 
joints glabrous but for a ventral row (coxa) or field (prefemur) of

setae, other joints with setae becoming increasingly larger and denser 
distally, the four terminal joints each with a distal whorl of large 
robust setae, tarsal joint with most vestiture on its dorsal (outer) 
surface. Tarsal claw long and evenly curved except on leg pairs 
3-15 of males, where they are bisinuate and compressed, distinctly 
ellipsoidal in cross-section, the upper edge thin and carinate. 

Prozonite of 7th segment reduced to a mere thin vestige mid- 
ventrally in front of gonopod aperture. The latter broadly transverse, 
up to 2.4 mm wide, its caudolateral edges elevated and flared laterad,

caudal rim between 8th leg pair set off by a low marginal ridge, the 
adjacent sternal area narrow and depressed. Gonopods rather small, 
the coxae normally retracted into the body, the elongate, nearly 
straight telopoditcs exposed, parallel to each other, directed cephalad 
between the legs of the 6th segment. Prefemur elongate, setose, 
the setae becoming longer distally, coxal side provided with a short, 
acicular prefemoral process. Gonopod in mesial aspect almost 
identical with that of C. g. laiassa (fig. 4,6), the distal end with a rather 
short SLibtriangular solcnomerite and nearly straight subapical process 
(fig. 4,e). 

Epigynal region of 3d segment of females without special lobes or 
other modifications. Cyphopods elongate-reniform in outline, the 
basal two-thirds with scattered large setae, the operculum with longer 
and more profuse vestiture. Width of outer valve nearly uniform, 
not somewhat greater near the base as apparently is the case in the 
other two subspecies (fig. 5,a). 

Dorsum glossy blackish, with the paranotal and broad median 
series of spots yellowish orange, the underparts whitish gray with 
the legs becoming yellow distally. The median dorsal spots are 
sublimate, and extend laterad almost to the paranota. 

Variation: The body form of the typical subspecies is quite uni- 
form over its range. Some minor geographic variation can be noted, 
however, for several structural details. 

Male specimens from eastern Alabama and most of Georgia are 
provided with fairly conspicuous subcoxal sternal knobs on the 7th 
segment. These become reduced in the mountain region and are 
obliterated in the intergrade population of western North Carolina. 
The solcnomerite of the male gonopod tends to increase in length 
northward. 

The color pattern is somewhat variable. The population of 
extreme eastern Alabama appears to be bimaculate. In central 
and northern Georgia the median spots are enlarged and lunate in 
form and in the males often contact the lateral series of spots and 
forming transverse bands of j'ellow. In southeastern Tennessee the 
three rows of spots are of about the same size, except in the western 
foothills of the Great Smokies in Blount County, where a local popu- 
lation has developed striking crossbands. It is of some interest to 
note that in the same region specimens of the normally trimaculate 
Apheloria montana are likewise transversely banded, and we may 
have a case of mimicry or a very improbable coincidence. 

The largest male specimen of C. g. georgiana measured is from 
Banks County, Georgia: 9.2 mm. wide and 34.5 mm. long. The 
largest female is from Pickens County, South Carolina: 9.0 mm. by 
37.0 mm.

Synonymy: Dissatisfied with the full specific status originally 
accorded the various new names proposed in this genus, subsequent 
authors have at one time or another considered them all to be strictly 
junior synonyms of georgiana, a feeling tentatively embodied in 
Chamberlin and Hoffman's "Checklist of the millipeds of North 
America." With diagnostic characters in Cherokia now being 
drawn from nonsexual modifications, a reappraisal of the names is 
very much in order. 

Fontaria tallulah was based by Bollman upon two female speci- 
mens collected by Underwood at Tallulah Falls, Habersham County, 
Georgia. The name thereupon fell into complete obscurity and 
was not investigated until 1949, when I had the opportunity to 
search for topotypes. Despite unfavorable climatic conditions, I 
was able to obtain in the penultimate instar two female millipeds 
which matched Bollman's description closely. These specimens 
were later found, on direct comparison, to be conspecific with the 
the types of tallulah. The name is based upon a population of 
Cherokia which cannot be separated from typical georgiana, Bollman 
apparently not having realized that his types were immature and 
that the final moult appreciably modifies the color pattern. My

paper of 1950 placed tallulah into a genus for the first time since the 
partition of the old name Fontaria, and correctly regarded it a junior 
synonym of georgiana, which has a one page priority in Bollman's 
paper. 

Exactly 50 years after the proposal of the name georgiana, Chamber- 
lin (1939) described a new xystodesmid under the name Mimuloria 
ducilla, the types coming from Soco Gap, North Carolina. The 
diagnosis was very brief, but included an accurate illustration of the 
gonopod. Loomis (1943) subsequently considered ducilla to be a 
synonym of georgiana, in which he was followed by my later discussion 
of the matter, largely because of the gonopod structure. I have now 
studied two series of topotypes of ducilla, both obtained personally, 
and find that the population at Soco Gap is representative of the 
narrow-bodied montane subspecies of georgiana, to which the name 
ducilla must now be applied. 

Mimuloria Jurcifer was described also by Chamberlin, on the basis 
of four specimens collected by A. S. Pearse in the Pisgah National 
Forest near Asheville, North Carolina. The form was contrasted 
only with ducilla, with differences in size, color, and gonopod minutae 
being noted. These are all differences which are here considered to 
distinguish ducilla, but it was apparently not realized by Chamberlin 
that furcijer might be the same as georgiana. After several unsuc- 
cessful visits to the type locality, I was finally rewarded in July 1958 
by the collection of several immature specimens, which, when reared 
to maturity, turned out to be representative of the intermediate 
population between ducilla and georgiana, and closer to the latter in 
most respects. These topotypes agree closely with other specimens 
from the same general region in having the median row of spots 
conspicuously reduced (see p. 234). 

Finally, once again Chamberlin (1947) proposed a new name for 
a species of Cherokia, but unfortunately placed it in the genus Dynoria, 
which probably belongs in a different subfamily. The types of 
Dynoria parvior came from Neel Gap, in the Blue Ridge country of 
north Georgia, and were very briefly described with respect to color, 
size, and gonopod structure. The contrasts with Dynoria icana are, 
of course, meaningless. The size range is given as 18-19 mm. in 
length, with a width of 7 mm. Correction of the length dimension 
to 28-29 mm. would yield a normal w/l ratio. 

I have not seen material from the type locality, but do have a fair 
series taken less than 20 miles away in the same mountain range. 
These specimens belong to the widespread trimaculate phase of the 
intergrade population, to which the name parvior (now no longer 
appropriate) is allocated as a strict junior synonym of the nominate 
subspecies of georgiana. This synonomy is not new; it was first

250 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

The distribution of the samples does not, in some cases, coincide 
exactly with that of certain key characters stipulated in the key and 
diagnoses. For instance, specimens with a w/l ratio of 26 percent or 
more occur across the western edge of South Carolina and into North 
Carolina as far as Pisgah Ridge. This segment of the species is 
regarded as intergradient rather than as georgiana because both color 
pattern and gonopod details reflect the characters of ducilla. It does 
seem probable, however, that migration to the northeast has carried 
the wide body form more successfully than the invasion of the moun- 
tains directly north of Georgia, although the typical lowland color 
patterns have been lost in both cases (a matter discussed at greater 
length on p. 251). 

The reader may be curious concerning the arbitrary selection of 
value upon which the isophenes of figure 1 are based. For the most 
part, the higher values (26-28 percent) occur throughout most of the 
generic range with little or no geographic variation. The narrow 
body form, however, coincides closely with the loss of tibio tarsal 
marginal spurs and the appearance of dark pleurites, and the ratio 
values were selected deliberately to include the population so charac- 
terized. The subspecies diagnosed by the stipulated aggregate fea- 
tures is thus seen to be restricted to the Great Smokies and the 
adjacent Unicoi ranges. The mutual development of characters 
within this area reflects the natural integrity of the population. 

It is anticipated that some critics of the subspecific category might 
assume the decreasing body form to be a function of elevation. This 
relationship is partly true, but is not the entire answer. Specimens 
with a ratio of 25 percent or more are available from the vicinity of 
Highlands, 3,800-4,000 feet; from Walnut Creek Gap, 4,800 feet; and 
from Co wee Bald, 5,000 feet— all in the Cowee Range. Specimens of 
ducilla with a ratio of 23 percent and less, are from Soco Gap, 3,800 
feet; from Mount Sterling, 4,000 feet; and from Chimneys Campground 
on the north side of Newfound Gap at less than 3,000 feet elevation. 
The specimens from the last-named locality are the narrowest of the 
genus, their ratio being 19 percent, and I think these figures prove 
that the distribution is more horizontal than vertical. 

There can be no doubt that the extensive high country of the 
Smokies has contributed to the ultimate differentiation of the localized 
segment of the species. I contend, however, that these mountains 
have received merely the culmination of the gradual northward pro- 
gression of several variable tendencies which can be traced for more 
than a hundred miles from the upper Piedmont of Georgia. Specimens 
from the Tallulah River drainage in northeastern Georgia and those 
from the basin of the Ocoee River in southeastern Tennessee agree well 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 251 

both in body form and color pattern with typical georgiana from 
farther south. 

Intermediate specimens from the Nantahala Range, at Wayah Bald, 
for instance, are the narrowest outside the range of ducilla, the average 
w/l being 24.3 percent. Millipeda from Smokemont, at a low eleva- 
tion (about 2,000 feet) at the very base of the Smokies and less than 
10 miles from Newfound Gap, are closer in every respect to the Nanta- 
hala population than to ducilla. Specimens from the type locality of 
due ilia are the broadest of the subspecies, five measurable males aver- 
aging 23.4 percent. These topotypes agree with narrower specimens 
from the high Smokies in color pattern and gonopod structure, however 
even though certainly not structurally typical of the population here 
called ducilla. Soco Gap is located in the Plott Balsam Mountains, 
a southeasterly trending satellite of the Great Smoky massif, which 
forms the boundary between Jackson and Haywood Counties, North 
Carolina, for about 30 miles. At its southeastern end, perhaps 20 
miles below Soco Gap, the local Cherokia population bears little close 
resemblence to typical ducilla. 

The local picture with reference to color pattern is somewhat more 
complicated. C. g. georgiana of the lowlands is either transversely 
banded or trimaculate with very broad median spots (these absent, 
however, from a single local population in southeastern Alabama) . In 
the Blue Ridge foothills of north Georgia the median spots tend to 
become smaller, and this reduction produces the trimaculate Cherokia, 
which is characteristic of the intermediate population as shown by 
hollow circles on the map. To the northeast, along the South Carolina 
border and into Pisgah Ridge, however, the median spots tend to 
become even smaller and create a local variant (discussed on page 234), 
in which they are obviously being lost. 

The basic color pattern in Cherokia (and many other xystodesmid 
genera) appears to be trimaculation. This inference is drawn both 
from its prevalence and from the fact that the penult instars of cross- 
banded adults are trimaculate. In some genera, as well, support is 
drawn from the geographic location of bimaculate or banded popula- 
tions on the periphery, or at extremes, of the range of vicarious tri- 
maculate populations. With so little known of the main georgiana 
lowland population, it would be premature to speculate on the inde- 
pendent recurrence of bands and spots in the range, but it is certainly 
noteworthy to disclose microcvolutionary developments within the 
intergrade population. 

Aside from the tendency toward reduction of the median spots, there 
are two local phenomena. First, in a very localized region shown by 
fine stipple on the map, many of the specimens (perhaps a third or 



252

half of the population sampled) have the basic yellow trimaculation, 
but additionally the spots are connected by a narrow chestnut-red 
band on the caudal edge of the tergites. This red does not merge with 
the yellow, but becomes more intense at the point of contact. In 
this form, the distal joints of the legs are pinkish or reddish instead of 
yellow. Specimens of this variety have been taken at the southern

end of the Cowee Range, in the vicinity of Highlands, North Carolina, 
and at several localities in the Chatooga River drainage shared Irv the 
two Carolinas and Georgia. 

At two places, Chatooga Ridge north of Mountain Rest, South 
Carolina, and Cool Springs, northeast of Toccoa, Georgia, specimens 
of the red-banded phase occur with fairly typical georgiana. At the 
latter locality, in addition to these, 1 found a male specimen with broad 
lemon yellow crossbands, all of which suggests considerable genetic 
instability at least as far as color is concerned. 

The second of the color variants occurs in the vicinity of Highlands, 
North Carolina. The median spots of many specimens of the normal 
trimaculate form tend to be quite wide, especially in females, and oc- 
casionally may touch those of the paranotal series. Occasional speci- 
mens will show a neat narrow yellow band on each tergite. In going 
northwest along the Cowee Mountains the red-banded form drops out 
at Walnut Creek Gap, 8 miles north of Highlands. Only 7 miles 
farther, at Cullowhee Gap, I found no specimens so marked. The 
extreme end of the Cowee Range, however, is taken over by a very 
attractive color form occuring in and around Cowee Bald, north of 
Franklin, North Carolina, as shown on the map (fig. 6) by the diagonal 
shading. In this form the tergites have a straight transverse yellow 
bar, which does not widen anteriorly on the paranota, nor middorsalh' 
except in a few females. As this phase seems to occur to the exclusion 
of all others at the isolated end of the Cowees (perhaps isolated by a 
rather low gap northeast of Franklin), this phase might form the sub- 
ject of future work on genetics in xystodesmids, work I hope will soon 
be undertaken. 

From the occasional capture of similar individuals in the very 
heterogeneous population around Highlands, one might postulate 
that the gene for this color pattern has been carried along the Cowees 
by a branch of what I think must have been a general northward 
migration of georgiana into the mountains. 

As can be appreciated from a glance at the map, the Highlands 
region is one of great importance in the distribution of color patterns 
in C. georgiana. This region shares one color phase with lowland 
C. g. georgiana, has the normal trimaculate pattern, is located adjacent 
to the area where the median spots are being suppressed, and, possibly, 
is the point of origin of a distinctive 3 T ellow-banded form. Further 
than this statement I cannot go, and commend investigation to some- 
one with the time and knowledge to perform controlled studies on 
pattern inheritance with the Highlands population. 

Concerning one other key character stipulated for ducilla — the com- 
plete absence of the tibiotarsal marginal spur — there is less to say. In 



254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

the Smokies the spur is uniformly absent; in the Cowee Range, it is 
absent in about 66 percent of the male specimens; further south at 
Highlands it is missing in about half. Eight males from western 
South Carolina have the spur well developed in each gonopod. In 
north Georgia in the Blue Ridge and Nantahalas, the spur is absent 
in about 36 percent. For the rest of the species' range, there are no 
adequate series for comparison. 

Specimens considered to be intergrades between Cherokia g. georg- 
iana and C. g. ducilla have been examined from the localities given 
below. In some cases assignation to this intermediate category rather 
than to one of the subspecies has necessarily been a little arbitrary, 
particularly in the northern portion of Georgia. The specimens ex-

Cherokia georgiana Hoffman, 1050, p. 23 (in part). 

Type specimens: Male holotype and female para type, Chamberlin 
collection, from Soco Falls, east of Cherokee, Jackson County, North 
Carolina, collected on April 29, 1939, by Nell B. Causey. 

Diagnosis: A small, narrow-bodied subspecies of Cherokia georgi- 
ana, the width less than 24 percent of the length, in which the tibio- 
tarsal spur is absent from the male gonopod and the sides of the seg- 
ments are brown or black instead of yellow. The solenomerite of the 
gonopod is generally more elongate than in the other two subspecies; 
the cyphopod a little more highly arched as seen in lateral aspect. 

Variation: Within the small geographic range occupied by this 
subspecies, there is an appreciable amount of variation in minor details, 
probably a reflection of evolutionary recency as well as of the rugged 
terrain inhabited by ducilla. 

The smallest specimen examined is a male from Indian Gap in the 
Smokies, measuring 27.5 mm. in length and 6.1 mm. in width; the 
largest, a female from Soco Gap, 36.5 mm by 8.7 mm. The average of 
several dozen male specimens is 30.5 mm. long and 6.5 mm. wide. 
The w/l ratio ranges from 19 percent, in a male from Chimneys 
Campground, near Gatlinburg, Tennessee, to 24.5 percent in a male 
from Soco Falls, North Carolina. Two other males from that locality, 
however, are much more slender, with ratios of 22.8 and 22.9 percent. 
The Soco Gap population, typical in the nomenclatorial sense, is not 
typical of the subspecies in most structural characters, but is represent- 
ative enough to impose its name upon the population at large. The 
w/l ratio averages about 22 percent in males from various localities 
in the Great Smokies. 

There is likewise some variability in color pattern, with the median 
dorsal row of spots chiefly affected. These spots may be either rather 
broad or smaller than the lateral scries, apparently without respect 
to elevation or locality. The most typical coloration is that described 
in the following notes made from life at Indian Gap, Tennessee, on 
August 4, 1958: 

Dorsum and head rich glossy black; legs, paranoia, and median 
dorsal spots creamy white. Antennae brownish; sternites brown, 
pleurites tan in females, dark brown in males, anal valves nearly black 
in both sexes. Median spots lenticular in females, nearly complete 
transverse bands in males, anterior collum spot wider than posterior, 
but collum almost completely ringed in some males. 



256 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Subsequent measurements show the median spots of the males from 
Indian Gap to be as much as 70 percent as wide as the metatergite; 
at Soco Gap the spots merge with those of the paranota forming 
complete bands. Smaller median spots prevail both north and south 
away from the central part of the Smokies, their width only 30 percent 
of the metatergite width in the vicinity of Mount Sterling, at Chimneys 
Campground, and in the Unicoi range south of the Little Tennessee 
River. 

Specimens from the Unicois are not entirely typical of ducilla; 
they have lighter colored pleurites (the anal valves quite dark, how- 
ever), and the tibiotarsal spur is variously developed in 4 of 8 males 
examined. The body form remains narrow, however; it averages 
21.7 percent in 6 males from Little Haw Knob and 22.2 percent in 2 
males from Stratton Gap. Whether this segment of ducilla has been 
isolated from that of the Great Smokies by the gorge of the Little 
Tennessee or has evolved independently from a common ancestral 
stock in the Nantahala region remains to be established. There 
would seem to be little chance for genetic exchange between the two 
isolated populations at the present time. 

Remarks: One of the most interesting aspects of the taxonomy 
of ducilla lies in the fact that to the east and southeast it grades almost 
imperceptibly into georgiana in all its diagnostic characters. To the 
west, fairly typical georgiana occurs in Cades Cove at the base of the 
Smokies, and ducilla in the same region attains its smallest and 
slenderest body form. No intergradation has been detected here, 
and I doubt that it occurs, the two forms being so radically different 
in size and shape. 

I hope that someone having the opportunity for extensive studies in 
the Great Smokies will be able to work out the relationships of the two 
local forms of Cherokia there, particularly in the region between New- 
found Gap and Cades Cove, and along the main ridge between Cling- 
man's Dome and Gregory Bald. 

Despite having collected ducilla at several places and different times, 
I have learned very little of its life history and activity. The mating 
season is somewhat later than that of georgiana) no mated pairs were 
collected until August 4, 1958, when some were taken at Indian Gap. 
Here specimens taken singly paired up while being carried in my hand, 
and remained clasped in a jar of humus overnight. No doubt the 
brevity of the warm season at such high elevations influences the 
maturation of individuals and postpones the mating activities. 

Confinement of energetic males from Indian Gap with females of 
georgiana taken near Toccoa, Georgia, resulted in nothing. The males 
were about 2 mm. narrower, and probably would have been unable to 
secure a suitable grip even had pairing been attempted.

Distribution: The Great Smokies and perhaps also the Unicois 
along the boundary of North Carolina and Tennessee, generally above 
an elevation of 3,000 feet. The northern known locality is Mount 
Sterling; the easternmost, Soco Gap. Whether ducilla occurs north of 
the Pigeon River remains to be determined. Approximate!}' 72 pre- 
served specimens, representing 14 collections, have been studied, as 
well as several dozen observed in the field but not retained. All of

Type specimens: Male holotype and two paratypes, USNM Myria- 
pod type No. 2532, (Diplopod No. D-512),from a bluff on the Caney 
Fork River, one mile northeast of Rock Island, Warren County, Ten- 
nessee, collected on May 9, 1951, by Leslie Hubricht. 

Diagnosis: A subspecies of Cherokia georgiana in which the scapu- 
lorae are completely marginal, concealing the anterior surface of the 
paranota when seen in dorsal aspect (fig. 3, a). In details of structure 
agreeing almost completely with the detailed description given for the 
nominate subspecies. 

Variation: The material examined shows very little structural var- 
iation. The size is remarkably uniform, the length ranging from 32 to 
35 mm. in most of the specimens and the width from 8.0 to 9.5 mm. 
The largest male seen is from Campbell County, Tennessee: 37.5 mm. 



258 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

long and 9.5 mm. wide. The largest female is from Talladega County, 
Alabama: 35.0 by 10.0 mm. 

The coloration is somewhat variable, the specimens from Kentucky 
and Tennessee generally trimaculate with broad median spots. A 
tendency for crossbanding increases southward, where the collum also 
develops an anterior yellow border. In northern Alabama (e.g., Jack- 
son County), the transition from trimaculate to banded patterns may 
often be noted on a single specimen, the bands being on the anterior 
half of the body and lunate spots being on the posterior half. Two 
females from Cheatham County, Tennessee, seem to have been cross- 
banded with chestnut in life; a male from directly south in Perry 
County, Tennessee, is typically trimaculate with yellow. 

Alabama specimens likewise tend toward development of somewhat 
more acute sternal spines, and in many males the 7th segment is pro- 
vided with two small conical sternal lobes at the base of the 8th legs. 
This occurrence can be traced as far north as Mountain View, Grundy 
County, Tennessee. With the available material, this structural vari- 
ation cannot be regarded other than as clinal, and even so is of a very 
low order of magnitude. 

The solenomerite of the male gonopod becomes, on the average, 
slightly more elongated from north to south, but without sufficient 
constancy to indicate more than a gradual trend. All the variants 
noted for the species proceed in a north to south direction, but there 
seems to be no point where an abrupt change occurs in any of them. 

Distribution: Extreme southeastern Kentucky, west and south 
through most of the Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee as far as the 
Western Highland Rim, south through Alabama to the general 
vicinity of Tuscaloosa; not yet known from the Coastal Plain of this 
state. In Tennessee it occurs abundantly in the Cumberland Plateau 
but apparently only west of the Sequatchie Valley, the form occur- 
ring on Walden Ridge being C. g. georgiaria. Specimens have been

In addition, latassa has been reported in the literature, under the 
name georgiana, from Monte Sano State Park, Madison County, 
Alabama, Hubricht, by Loomis (1943, p. 402); from Haleyville, 
Winston County, Alabama, V. E. Shelford, by Loomis (1944, p. 173); 
and from Pelham, Shelby County, Alabama, C. J. and M. Goodnight, 
by Loomis and Hoffman (1948, p. 52). 

I.xtekgradation: Throughout its wide range, Cherokia g. latassa is 
remarkably stable as regards its principal diagnostic character. In 
Pact, this structural integrity, coupled with the quality level of its 
difference from typical georgiana, led me to consider latassa as a dis- 
tinet species for some time. This opinion gradually altered as a re- 
sult of the realization that other equally important taxonomic characters 
were distributed without regard to the two paranotal types, and with 
the discovery of several specimens which, while clearly referable to 
latassa, indicate the probability of intergradation with georgiana. 

A male from Steele, St. Clair County, Alabama (H. E. Evans), is 
of interest in two respects: First, the scapulorae are completely mar- 
ginal but become somewhat crenulated in outline toward the body; 
they resemble the form taken in georgiana. Second, the sternal spines 
are much longer than normal for latassa and also appear as distinct 
subcoxal conicles on the 7th segment. 

A male from 3.5 miles northeast of Brent, Bibb County, Alabama 
(L. Hubricht), does not have distinct subcoxal cones on the 7th 
segment, but the scapulorae are almost directly transverse instead of 
convex anteriorly, and thereby nearly subniarginal. While these 
two specimens alone do not constitute direct evidence of intergrada- 
tion, they show that the two paranotal types can be joined by inter- 
mediate forms. 



260 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Phylogenetic Relationships 

To the best of my knowledge no one has yet expressed an opinion 
concerning the systematic position of Cherokia or its relationships 
to other genera, aside from a remark in my 1950 treatment that: 
"The disparity in sizes of the [cyphopod] valves suggests relation- 
ships with Zinaria, as does the nature of the sternites and male 
gonopods." Since then I have found no reason to revise this state- 
ment, but have come to recognize other genera as perhaps even more 
closely related to Cherokia. These form a discrete natural group 
worthy of formal tribal recognition: 

Rhysodesniini, new tribe 

I propose this tribe for xystodesmid genera hi which the coxae of 
the gonopods are attached to a distinct slender sternite and join the 
prefemora at a right angle and in which the postcoxal division of the 
telopodite is typically nearly straight and the prefemur elongate and 
not globosely enlarged basally. When present, the prefemoral process 
is simple, slender, and acicular. These genera include polymorphic 
species of very variable form, in which the general form of the male 
gonopod is subject to little, if any, specific modifications. 

The following genera (the validity of some of which seems not to be 
beyond challenge) at present constitute the tribe: 

Rhysodesmus Cook, 1895 Howellaria Hoffman, 1950 

Cruzodesmus Chamberlin, 1943 Cherokia Chamberlin, 1949 

Acenlronus Chamberlin, 1943 Pleuroloma Rafinesque, 1820 2 
Boraria Chamberlin, 1943 

The first five names of the list represent closely allied species groups, 
which some authors might prefer to unite in a single genus. The last 
two are much more strongly differentiated, to the extent that probably 
no one would question their claim to generic rank. Rhysodesmus, in 
particular, is highly variable and about 80 species have so far been 
described. The others are less extensive, and their rate of evolution 
seems to be more moderate. 

With the recognition of but a single species in this genus, attention 
need be paid only to the status of the three geographic races of C. 
georgiana. 

That these three groups are conspecific is, I believe, obvious. While 
remarkably dissimilar in appearance and probably unable to inter- 
mate, C. g. georgiana and C. g. ducilla are nonetheless connected by a 
broad zone of intermediate populations which bridge by small grada- 
tions the gaps in all the diagnostic characters. The two named sub- 
species are fairly constant over their ranges — as defined by the sum of 
several characters taken in combination — but it has been sometimes

loma as the correct one for the genus. 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA — HOFFMAN 261 

difficult to determine whether a certain local population should be 
considered as part of a subspecies or of the intergrading series. This 
fact seems a common and entirely reasonable consequence of geograph- 
ically induced speciation. 

On the other hand, C. g. georgiana and C. g. lalassa differ mainly in 
but a single character, but in such a profound one that it separates all 
the material examined into one group or the other. The reasons for 
considering these two groups as conspecific have already been set 
forth: The virtual identity in all other structural details; separate 
distributions; the occurrence of some specimens of latassa which 
presage the appearance of intergradient characters; and the sharing 
by the two groups of sternal knobs on segment 7, in the region w here 
intergradation is presumed to occur. 

The inference L draw from the relationship of latassa lo georgiana 
is one of a division of the parent population into two parts, with the 
barrier subsequently withdrawn before specific divergence had been 
achieved. Judged from present distributions, the Tennessee River 
seems entirely possible as the isolating mechanism because of the 
change in course to the southwest through eastern Alabama. That 
such a diversion occurred is contended by numerous zoologists, 
although there is by no means complete agreement. Reestablishment 
of the river in its present course curving westward through northern 
Alabama would permit an eastward migration of the subspecifically 
differentiated latassa and eventual contact and intergradation with 
georgiana in the region where, today, the evidence suggests it occurs. 

The relationship of ducilla to georgiana seems more intimate and 
suggests virtually uninterrupted contact between the two, with <hu ilia 
representing a recent terminal race of the migration northward into 
the mountains. So far as I know, georgiana does not cross the French 
Broad River, whereas latassa ranges much farther north, into Ken- 
tucky. From the great variability of georgiana in western North 
Carolina, and its relatively narrow distribution there, I judge that the 
species' occupation of the mountains is a fairly recent event. Pre- 
sumably the roughness of the terrain enhances or imposes localized 
variability; latassa varies less over a range thirty times as great. 

It therefore seems reasonable to assume that georgiana and latassa 
diverged first, and in only one character. The race ducilla is a younger 
offshoot of georgiana, and differs in several characters because of the 
opportunities afforded by the invasion by its parental stock of a strong- 
ly dissected country with different climatic conditions. The relation- 
ship may be expressed thus: 

ducilla 
latassa / 

\ georgiana 

parental georgiana 



262 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

In recent years several opponents of the subspecies category have, 
most correctly, pointed out that many workers have erected subspecies 
on the basis of a single character in a limited region, without con- 
sideration of the total variability within the entire species involved. 
In such cases, whenever another (and perhaps equally important) 
character is emphasized as the basis for separation, an entirely differ- 
ent pattern of "subspecies" emerges. The present work has been 
done in complete cognizance and appreciation of such circumstances, 
but although all the populations in the genus Cherokia are held to be 
conspecific, three of them appear to be so distinctive and so constant 
throughout their ranges that recognition as subspecies seems to be 
warranted and actually desireable. Those who wish to discard 
trinomials may refer to latassa as the Cumberland Plateau population, 
to georgiana as the Georgia population, and to ducilla as the Great 
Smokies population, of Cherokia georgiana, but I do not see what is 
to be gained by the substitution of polynomial vernacular names in 
place of short Latin designations carrying the same implication. 

Summary 

A number of local populations within the genus Cherokia have been 
given specific names in the past, in many cases the diagnostic charac- 
ters being more apparent than real. A restudy of the genus, based 
upon more than 400 specimens and typical material of most of the 
names, shows that most of these species are merely local populations 
of one variable species. The gonopods are remarkably similar in 
all the material examined, and the external body form is equally vari- 
able. It is concluded that the most extreme variants in the genus are 
eventually connected by intergradient populations, and that Cherokia 
is mono ty pic. 

The importance of this conclusion rests in its presumable effect on 
the definition of species in the family Xystodesmidae. Common 
practice of the past decade has resulted in the erection of numerous 
specific names for millipeds from single localities, differing solely in 
color pattern or other minor features. Such forms have been 
apparently proposed in a sort of taxonomic vacuum which presupposed 
that any difference must be of specific value. One paper (Causey, 
1951), attempted to justify such an approach with the philosophical 
suggestion that in some genera, specific differences obtain only in 
nonsexual features, with the gonopods remaining identical or nearly 
so in the different forms. Such species were designated by the special 
term "isogenitive." 

It must be obvious that the validity of the idea of "isogenitive 
species" rests entirely upon what was never proved, that the named 
forms involved are actually different species. Presumably, as long 



MILLIPED GENUS CHEROKIA HOFFMAN 263 

as one examined only small samples of specimens, from widely sepa- 
rated localities, such reasoning might have some appeal. It seems more 
reasonable to me, however, to assume that such local variants are 
nothing more than populations, perhaps sometimes subspecifically 
distinct, of widespread polymorphic species. The phenomenon of 
geographic variability in most species has been recognized and under- 
stood for quite a long time. 

In disposing of "isogenitive species" as doubtlessly only the results 
of localized microevolution, which is far from reaching the species 
level, I note that even the term appears to be incorrectly formed, 
presumably from the Greek "isos" (equal) and the Latin "genitivus" 
(possessive case). From the usage of the word, the meaning iso- 
genital was implied — "isos" + "genitalis" (of the sexual organs)— but 
even this usage is objectionable because of its hybridity. 

The present study has shown that populations of one species may 
be so divergent that, given only specimens of the t}'pical forms, one 
would be justified in considering them specifically different. This 
discovery should be of considerable aid in the evaluation of species 
in large genera such as Rhysodesmus, in which the gonopods are re- 
markably similar, and in which species have been erected on characters 
such as size and color, and even then only by overlooking previously 
named species from the same general regions.

REEXAMINATION OF SPECIES OF PROTURA 
DESCRIBED BY H. E. EWING 



By F. Bonet AND S. L. Tuxen 1 



In 1948 F. Bonet went to Washington on a Guggenheim Memorial 
Scholarship to study the Ewing collection of Protura. He redescribed 
three of Ewing's species of Eosentomon in 1950 without, however, 
giving figures. In 1956 S. L. Tuxen, supported by the Carlsberg 
Foundation, Copenhagen, also went to Washington for the same 
purpose, after having discussed matters with Bonet in Mexico. They 
arranged to publish the redescriptions of Ewing collection jointly. 
Tuxen took Bonet's notes to Washington and limited himself to a 
study of the characters which Bonet had not taken into consideration. 
All figures in the present paper were made by Tuxen when it is not 
expressly stated "drawn by Bonet." The present paper was com- 
pleted in 1957 and submitted for publication in November of that 
year. 

The authors wish to express their sincerest thanks to the foundations 
which have supported their studies, and extend special thanks to 
Grace Glance without whose kind help they could not have made the 
studies.

For the systematics of the Protura it seems of paramount importance 
to be able to define with certainty which species the first describers 
had before them. In his redescriptions of the species described by 
Berlese and Silvestri, Tuxen (1956) stressed characters not known 
by these authors: The setae and sensillae of the foretarsus, the female 
genital squama, and the chaetotaxy. In 1958 Tuxen did the same for 
a species described by Stach. In the present paper a similar study has 
been made of the species which were described by Ewing and are now 
kept in the U.S. National Museum, Washington. 

Ewing described his species in several papers. In 1921 he described 
Acerentulus barberi, the first American proturan to be identified since 
Silvestri's specimen, collected in the vicinity of New York in 1909 
and called Eosentomon wheeleri. The type specimen of wheeleri was 
supposed lost, until its rediscovery was reported by Tuxen (1960). 

In 1921 Ewing also described 10 more species from the United 
States. They were placed in three old and three new genera. The 
specimens were all found near Washington, D.C. The next year he 
briefly mentioned the then known distribution of Protura in the United 
States. In 1924 he described a new species from Florida, and in 1927 
a new species from the western states. In 1936 he compiled a "syn- 
onymy and synopsis" of the genera then known. A larger paper in 
1940 summed up all the knowledge of the North American Protura and 
contained the descriptions of six new species. Thus 19 species were 
described by Ewing, besides the redescription of E. wheeleri Silvestri. 
Of these species, he identified A. tenuiceps as a synonym of A. barberi 
and, erroneously, E. minimum as a synonym of E. pallidum in 1940. 
The types of the remaining species will be discussed in the present 
paper. 

The 1940 paper by Ewing is based on much more material than the 
types, in all about 200 slides. Part of this material is incorrectly deter- 
mined and part of it probably comprises new, hitherto undescribed 
species, but it does not seem advisable to describe more species as long 
as the species of Ionescu and Womersley have not been reexamined. 
In 1960 Tuxen finished this task. 

A small, ridiculous difficulty in describing arose. In 1949 both of us 
invented systems of numbering the dorsal abdominal setae, but 
unfortunately in opposite directions, Tuxen made the median setae 
No. 1 , while Bonet made the lateral ones No. 1 . Bonet used his system 
in 1949 and 1950. Tuxen used his system in 1949 and in the papers 
since 1955. Among the latter were the redescriptions of Berlese's and 
Silvestri's species. Since it is easier to define the position of the median 
setae than that of the lateral ones (the pleura are not always distin- 
guishable from the terga), the "Tuxen-system" of numbering will be 



EWING'S PROTURAN SPECIES — BONET AND TUXEN 267 

used in this and all future papers by us. The setae and sensillae of the 
foretarsus are numbered on the figures according to the system de- 
scribed by Tuxen in 1955 and 1958. Readers of the Bonet papers of 
1949 and 1950 should be aware of this difference. 
The 18 species whose types we shall deal with here are the following: 

Genus Eosenlomon Berlese: A. conurus Ewing 

E. vermiforme Ewing A. andrei Ewing 

E. pallidum Ewing A. chrislensoni Ewing 

E. minimum Ewing A. occidentalis Ewing 
E. yosemitense Ewing Genus Acerentulus Berlese: 

E. rostratum Ewing A. barberi Ewing (=A. tenui- 
E. pusillum Ewing ceps Ewing) 

Genus Protentomon Ewing: A. oculatus Ewing 

P. transitans Ewing A. bicolor Ewing ( = Aceren- 

Genus Microentomon Ewing: iuloides bicolor) 

M. minutum Ewing A. floridanus Ewing ( = Aceren- 

Genus Acerentomon Silvestri: tornon floridanum) 

A. americanum Ewing A. aureilarsus Ewing 

A neotype of Acerentomon calijornicum (Hilton) (= Acerentulus 
californicus Hilton) is described and a redescription is given of Eosen- 
tomon wheeleri Silvestri on the basis of Ewing's specimens. 

Of Ewing's genera only Protentomon is valid, and of his 19 species 
only the following are valid: Eosentomon vermiforme, E. pallidum, E. 
yosemitense, E. rostratum, E. pusillum, Protentomon transitans, 
Acerentomon andrei, Acerentulus americanus, A. barberi, A. floridanus, 
and A. aureitarsus. 

The concept of Acerentomon and Acerentulus used in this paper is 
based on the labrum and the maxillary palpi, and holds good in 
extreme cases, but transitional forms may be found. The justification 
of the two genera needs reexamination.

The species described by Silvestri in 1909 as wheeleri was collected 
in humus in woods around New York. The type was said (Tuxen 
1956b, p. 719) to be missing from Silvestri's collection of Protura 
in Portici. 

In 1940 Ewing described a species as wheeleri from material collected 
in Maryland, Virginia, and Texas. He had not seen the type specimen. 

In 1942 Bonet described a species as wheeleri from several localities 
in Mexico. In 1956 Tuxen decided to make a specimen of this latter 
species the neotype of wheeleri, since the holotype was supposedly

lost. However, as Bonet bad stated that his wheeleri had never been 
found outside Mexico, and as it was specifically different from Ewing's 
wheeleri, which was found in the eastern United States, it then seemed 
preferable to choose a specimen of Ewing's wheeleri for the neotype. 
Therefore, in his paper on Silvestri's types of Protura, Tuxen changed 
the name of Bonet's wheeleri to boneti, new name, and postponed the 
redescription of wheeleri until he had examined Ewing's material. 
In preparing the present paper we chose from this material for our 
description a female bearing the data Mount Rogers, Virginia, eleva- 
tion 5,000 ft., under dead chestnut bark, Sept. 19, 1938, Ewing and 
Gurney collectors. Now that the actual holotype has been recovered, 
we find that our redescription agrees with it (see Tuxen, 1960, p. 298). 

Some of the drawings were made from another slide containing 3 
males, 3 females, and 2 maturi juniores labeled, under bark of logs, 
Elk Garden Ridge, Jefferson National Forest, Virginia, Sept. 18, 1938, 
Ewing and Gurney collectors. 

On the foretarsus (figs. 1-2), compared with the drawings of E. 
armatum StSLch(—E. transitorium Berlese) by Tuxen (1958), the follow- 
ing differences are noticed : The t 1 has a very characteristic thicken- 
ing along one margin, in some cases making it appear to be a twined 
sensilla, the disc being more or less invisible. The a, c 1, e, and g 
are longer; d and f 2 are shorter in wheeleri than in transitorium; t 1 is 
nearer a 3' in wheeleri, a fact especially important inasmuch as the 
relation of the part of the foretarsus outside t 1 to the one inside t 1 
will thus be 8:7 (=1.15), while in transitorium it is 8:8 ( = 1.00), the 
part outside t 1 being measured to the beginning of the pretarsus. We 
propose to denote this relation by the sign d:p (distal part: proximal 
part), and state that d:p = 1.15 in wheeleri Silvestri and d:p=1.00 
in transitorium Berlese. On the interior side of the foretarsus, a' is 
shorter than in transitorium; it just reaches the tip of t 1. 

The female squama genitalis is shown in figure 3 from the dorsal 
side. It is very different from that of transitorium. The head of 
processus sternales is slightly rounded, rather like the squama of E. 
mexicanum Silvestri and boneti Tuxen (1956b).

'3" are missing. 























• "3a" is extremely short, not much longer than its pit. 

The most remarkable features are the following: 1. s VIII %. 
Bonet (1949-50) divided the species of Eosentomon into groups ac- 
cording to the number of setae in s VIII. The mexicanum group has 
two anterior setae and no central posterior seta. The pallidum group 
has no anterior setae; E. transitorium belongs to this group. E. 
wheeleri, which has two anterior setae and a central posterior seta, 
belongs to a third group. We may call this the wheeleri group. Tuxen 
(1956b) shows that E. boneti belongs to the last group. 

2. The presence of "3" in the anterior row of t III-IV, making 
a row of 12 setae. In boneti and mexicanum there are only 10 ante- 
rior setae. In transitorium 12 anterior setae are present in t III-IV 
as well as in V and VI, but these latter ones are missing in wheeleri. 

The accessory setae are longer than the principal ones, as is also 
the case in mexicanum and especially boneti, but in transitorium they 
are equal. Figure 10 shows this as well as the shape of the lamina, 
anterior to the anterior apodeme. Figure 11 shows the sternal part 
of the same segment. 

Tarsus III is provided with a distinct spine (fig. 12). 

The mouth parts are shown in figures 13-14. Until now the mouth 
parts have not been used in the systematics of Eosentomon, but from 
the description of the next species it is apparent that they may differ 
widely within the genus. Those of wheeleri do not differ very much 
from those of transitorium (Berlese 1909). 

Eosentomon vermiforme Ewing

We have examined and drawn figures from the holotype and a 
paratype slide of this species. The holotype was collected from decay- 
ing leaves in Takoma Park, Maryland, by H. E. Ewing, February 14, 
1921, and the paratypes in dead leaves from Plummers Island, 
Maryland, by R. C. Shannon, March 18, 1924. The paratype slide 
contains 1 male and 2 females; only the male has foretarsi. The 
holotype specimen is a female.

On the foretarsus (figs. 15-16), t 1 resembles to some degree sensilla 
t 1 of wheeleri in having the thickening along one margin of the disc; 
the disc itself is often quite invisible. The a is very short, c 2 longer, 
and c 1 shorter than in E. wheeleri; they are nearly alike in size; e and 
especially g are shorter. The t 1 is located very near the base of 
a 3'; d:p is 8:11 (=0.75). The empodium is longer in relation to 
the claw than in wheeleri; the relation is 8:9 ( = 0.9). We will call 
this relation e:u, empodium: unguis; in wheeleri it is 3:5 (=0.6). 

The female squama genitalis (fig. 17) resembles that of wheeleri, 
only the outer angles of the well-sclerotized part are longer and 
proceed proximally to a larger degree. Processus sternalis is as it is 
in wheeleri.

Figures 18-19 show the chaetotaxy of abd. V. It is apparent that 
the accessor} 7 setae in the terga are a little shorter than the principal 
ones, "la" in VII being as usual very much shorter. The shape of 
the anterior tergal lamina is also shown. 

On the basis of the chaetotaxy of s VIII, the species belongs to the 
wheeleri group; it is apparent that the chaetotaxy exhibits no difference 
at all from this species. 

Tarsus III has a spine which is weaker than that usually found in 
the genus, although it is distinctly stronger than even the strongest of 
the setae. Figure 20 shows that the setae on the tarsus are of 
extremely different development. 

The most significant characters are found in the mouth parts and in 
the slender shape of the head (fig. 21). The mouth parts (fig. 22) 
exceed the forcmargin of the head so that the tip of the mandibles, 
which is equipped with distinct striae, is easily seen. The galea and 
outer lacinia (La 2) are nearly as long as the maxillary palpus. Both 
laciniae have a very characteristic appearance different from that of 
E. wheeleri and E. transitorium.

Eosentomon pallidum Ewing, 1921b, p. 194; 1940, p. 525.— Bonet, 1950, p. 116. 

This species, especially the chaetotaxy, was redescribed in 1950 by 
Bonet, but without figures. In 1940 Ewing supposed E. minimum 



274 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Ewing (1921b) to be synonymous with this species; however, a reex- 
amination of the holotype of minimum showed it to be E. vermiforme 
Ewing. 

The holotype, a female, was collected from decaying leaves at 
Takoma Park, Maryland, by H. E. Ewing, April 3, 1921. 

The drawings were all made from the holotype except figures 25-26 
and 28, which were made from a female collected in Fayette County, 
Kentucky, by Ritcher and Sanderson on May 6, 1947, and determined 
by Bonet. 

No foretarsus (see fig. 23) was found lying in a position suited for 
drawing it from the interior side. The t 1 is remarkable in its pointed 
shape, without the thickening along the margin as seen in the two 
former species. In other respects the shape and size of the sensillae 
are equal to those of vermiforme; however, b is stouter, and a and f 1 
are much longer in E. pallidum. The t 1 is placed rather near a 3 
and away from a 3'; d:p=75:80 (=0.95); e:u = 22:24(=0.9). 

The female squama genitalis (fig. 24) is of a peculiar shape, different 
from that of the two former species. The processus sternales have no 
sharp edges as in E. transitorium nor any beak-shaped rounding as in 
wheeleri and vermiforme. 

The chaetotaxy is described by Bonet (1950, note that for denoting 
the setae he uses other numbers than we do). Schematically it is 
given as follows:

' missing 





















The most remarkable facts are the missing anterior row of sVIII 
(Bonet, 1950, built the pallidum group on this character), and the 
missing six interior setae in the anterior row of t VII; only the lateral 
one and the two "pleural" ones on each side are present. In the first 
character pallidum resembles transitorium; in the second one it does 
not. 

Figures 25-26 show the position of the ventral and tergal setae in 
abd. vTII-XII from the specimen determined by Bonet. 

Figure 27 is of the holot} r pe and shows tlV; it is apparent that the 
accessory setae are much longer than the principal ones. The lamina 
anterior to the anterior apodeme is nearly invisible. 

Tarsus III (fig. 28) shows a very distinct spine. It is further re- 
markable in its long empodium. The drawing is from the specimen 
determined by Bonet.

Eosentomon minimum Ewing 

Eosentomon minimum Ewing, 1921b, p. 195. 

In 1940 Ewing abandoned E. minimum and stated that it is a 
synonym of E. 'pallidum Ewing (1940, p. 525). He made a mistake; 
an examination of his holotype in the U.S. National Museum has 
shown that it is a specimen of E. vermiforme Ewing. Therefore, 
E. minimum Ewing is a synonym of E. vermiforme Ewing.

Figures 29-32 
Eosentomon yosemitensis Ewing, 1927, p. 146; 1940, p. 528. — Bonet, 1950, p. 123 

According to grammatical rules the spelling should be yosemitense 
since Eosentomon is neuter. 

The species was redescribed, especially in respect to the chaetotaxy, 
by Bonet (1950) without figures. 

The holotype is the only specimen of the species known, and bears 
the label, floor of Yosemite Valley, California, in decaying leaves and 
twigs, H. E. Ewing collector, April 15, 1927. It is impossible to give 
a complete description of all characters. 

Only one of the foretarsi (see fig. 29) is present on the holotype 
and is somewhat damaged. The sensillae on the interior side as well 
as some of the exterior ones are not visible. The t 1 has the same 
thickened rim as in E. vermiforme, but is situated more proximally to 
a 3'; d:p = 7:6(=1.15). The a could not be seen, and c 2 seems to 
be broken off; b is situated distally to c 1-c 2, not in a row as in 
vermiforme; e:u=10:12(=0.85). 

In 1940 Ewing remarked that "the dorsal setae of tarsus I arise 
from tubercles." This statement is incorrect; we can see no difference 
in this respect from the other Eosentomon species. 

The female squama genitalis (fig. 30) is very different from that of 
the other species, the processus sternales forming a kind of ring, open 
at two sides, surrounding the opening of the oviduct. It must be 
pointed out that the squama in the drawing is seen from the ventral 
side, but in the drawings of the other American species, from the dorsal 
side. However, this change cannot account for the great difference 
(see also the drawings of the squama of E. armatum (=E. transitorium) 
from both sides in Tuxen, 1958). The "ring" is not horizontal but 
somewhat oblique. 

The chaetotaxy schematically is as follows:

*> "2" and "3" are missing. 

















" "1-3" are missing. 

The missing anterior row of sVIII places the species in the pallidum 
group of Bonet; characteristic are the missing No. 2 in the anterior 
row of tlV and Nos. 2-3 in the anterior row of tV-VI; in other cases 
the setae will be lacking in the following order (from abd. IV- VII) : 
"3," "1," and "2." Also the small number of setae in sIX-X is 
characteristic. 



278 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Generally speaking the accessory setae are longer than the principal 
ones; no drawing has been made to show this. Bonet (1950) states 
that the principal setae are very short. 

Tarsus III (fig. 31) bears a distinct spine and a short em podium. 

The mouth parts (fig. 32) were only roughly sketched during the 
stay in Washington and could not be checked at a later time. They 
resemble those of vermiforme, in exceeding the foremargin of the head 
and in having mandibular striae. 

Eosentomon rostratum Ewing 

Figures 33-36 
Eosentomon rostratum Ewing, 1940, p. 520. 

This species was described by Ewing as having a very long labrum, 
unique in the genus Eosentomon. Curiously, Ewing (1940) 
stated that formerly he "doubtless confused this labrum with the 
mandibles." In fact the species does not have a labrum. 

There are two specimens on the holotype slide, and the data are, 
Highlands, North Carolina, on molding hemlock and deciduous tree 
leaves, May 8, 1936, V. R. Watson collector. These specimens were 
mentioned by Brimley (1938, p. 502) as E. vermiforme. 

Only one other specimen of this species is known, collected at 
Ganntown, Illinois, December 29, 1932, by B. Harper and determined 
by Bonet. This specimen also has been used for the present descrip- 
tion. It is a male. 

Only one foretarsus (see fig. 33) was present on the holotype slide, 
and it was clearly visible only from the exterior side. The t 1 has a 
thickened rim, a is very short, c 2 extremely short, and c 1 long; b, c 1, 
and c 2 are in a line just as they are in E. wheeleri and vermiforme. 
The t 2 is short and d long; e and g are insignificantly broadened; a' 
is very long, t 1 just at the base of a 3'; d:p=58:90( = 0.65), a very 
unusual proportion probably due to some degree to the foretarsus not 
lying horizontally in the mount; e:u = 20:26 (=0.75). 

The chaetotaxy in every respect is equal to that of vermiforme, 
with the exception that s IX-X=4, not 6. Figure 34 of tV shows 
that the accessory setae are shorter than the principal ones, as they 
are in vermiforme. 

Tarsus III has a distinct spine. 

The mouth parts (figs. 35-36) are characterized by the very long 
and slender mandibles, which proceed very far in front of the fore- 
margin of the head; in the holotype they even exceed the maxillary 
palpi. The galea and laciniae resemble in shape the corresponding 
ones in vermiforme. The mandibles are striated as in vermiforme.

EWING' S PROTURAN SPECIES — BONET AND TUXEN 281 

We have given figures of the mouth parts of both the holotype and 
the specimen determined by Bonet. 

The female squama genitalis could not be drawn from the holotype 
as the tip of the abdomen is bent downwards; so far as could be seen 
it resembles that of vermiforme. 

Although this species has very many features in common with 
vermiforme, we think that it is a different species because of the very 
curious mandibles, the different sizes of the sensillae a' and especially 
the proportion c 2:c 1, and the difference in the number of setae in 
sIX-X. 

Eosentomon pusilluni Ewing

Eosentomon pusillum Ewing, 1940, p. 527. — Bonet, 1950, p. 111. 

Bonet redescribed pusillum in 1950 without figures. There are 
only two slides present of this species, a female holotype in good 
condition and three paratypes in poor condition. Data for holotype 
and paratypes are, Orlando, Florida, in decaying leaves and twigs, 
H. E. Ewing collector, May 26, 1922. 

On the fore tarsus (figs. 37-38), t 1 is without a thickened rim; a is 
very small; the other sensillae are as they are in E. wheeleri. The 
em podium is nearly as long as the claw; e:u = 15:17( = 0.9). The 
t 1 is near a 3, not a 3'; d:p = 55:45(=1.2). The c' and t 3 were not 
visible on the only foretarsus present on the four specimens. 

The female squama genitalis (fig. 39) is very different from that of 
the other species; the processus stcrnales has pointed edges. 

The chaetotaxy as given by Bonet schcmaticalh 7 is as follows:

■ "1" and "3" are missing. 



The most important points in the chaetotaxy are the presence of 
all anterior setae on t V-VI and the fact that only four setae are miss- 
ing on tVII. Having two anterior setae on sVIII and a central 
posterior one, the species belongs to the wheeleri group.

Figure 40 shows the accessary setae to be much longer than the 
principal ones. It also shows the shape of the lamina before the 
anterior apodeme. 

Tarsus III possesses only a very insignificant spine (fig. 41), the 
existence of which one would deny if he were not prepared to find it. 

The pseudoculi (fig. 42) are extraordinarily large. The mouth parts 
have not been examined, but must resemble those of wheeleri. 

Protentotnon transitans Ewing 

Figures 43-44 

Protcntomon transitans Ewing, 1921b, p. 196. — Ewing, 1940, p. 532. 

Ewing mentions only one specimen, the holotype, of this tiny 
species, but in fact two more are present in his collection. Data for 
the holotype are, Takoma Park, Maryland, in decaying leaves, H. E. 
Ewing collector, April 24, 1921. Data for the other two specimens 
are Jasper County, Georgia, in peach orchard soil, William F. Turner 
collector, July 24, 1936. They were determined by Ewing as Protento- 
mon and Proturentomon respectively, but the abdominal comb being 
without teeth indicates that they belong to Protentotnon (see Tuxen 
1956a). 

We have drawn the foretarsus from the exterior side and the ab- 
dominal comb of the holotype (figs. 43-44) to show the likeness with 
Protentomon perpusillum Berlese as described by Tuxen (1956a, 
pp. 247-252) ; in fact there is no difference at all in these characters. 
The only difference is found in the chaetotaxy, and it is very slight. 
Tuxen (1956a) did not venture to decide whether Protentomon per- 
pusillum Berlese and Protentomon thienemanni Strenzke were in fact 
different species on account of the small chaetotactical differences. 
The chaetotaxy of Protentomon transitans is in accordance with neither 
of them. 

Thus the difference is stated schematically as follows: 

perpusillum thienemanni transitans 
t VIII ant. 4 6 4 

t X 8 6 10 

s XI 4 6 6 

We should warn, however, against placing to much stress on these 
differences in chaetotaxy. For instance, it is worth noticing that in

the two specimens of transitans? from Jasper County, only the two 
long setae on either side of XI are present, in perpusillum the long 
and the short setae on either side and in one specimen of thiene- 
manni all three setae are present. Probably the number of setae may 
vary to some degree, as was already shown by Tuxen (1955); so until 
a larger series of the three "species" is available, we cannot decide 
whether to give them specific rank. 

Microentomon minutum Ewing 

Microentomon minutum Ewing, 1921b, p. 200. 
Microentomon perpusillum Ewing, 1940, p. 533. 

The history of this species is a curious one (Tuxen 1956a, p. 249). 
Ewing described it in 1921 from three immature specimens, although 
he said that he had often seen specimens (supposedly adult) alive. In 
1936 he stated that the tarsi are without sensillae, that the second ab- 
dominal legs are one segmented, and that the genus should be included 
in the subfamily Protentomoninae (with 2-segmented second abdom- 
inal leg). In 1940 he even synonymized it with Berlese's Acerentulus 
perpusillus. 

All three slides were originally labeled Microentomon minutum, but 
two were later changed to perpusillum. Two slides including the 
holotype bear the data, Takoma Park, Maryland, in decaying leaves 
and twigs, H. E. Ewing collector, April 10, 1921; the third one, 
Takoma Park, Maryland, under bark of decaying twig, H. E. Ewing 
collector, April 24, 1921. All three specimens are immature and have 
only 10 abdominal segments; all very distinctly possess one-segmented 
second abdominal legs and furthermore have a distinct comb on the 
eighth abdominal tergum. They are evidently young specimens of an 
acerentomid, and very probably of Ewing's Acerentomon conurus, with 
which they were found. 

The genus Microentomon should therefore be entirely abandoned, 
and the species minutum considered as identical with Acerentomon 
conurus, a junior synonym of Acerentulus americanus (Ewing). 

Acerentomon americanum Ewing 

Figures 45-54 
Acerentomon americanum Ewing, 1921b, p. 197. — Ewing, 1940, p. 536. 

Two slides are labeled as this species, but they probably belong to 
two different species, one of them undescribed. We shall here confine 
ourselves to describing and drawing the holotype, a female. Data 
for the holotype are Takoma Park, Maryland, from decaying leaves, 
March 27, 1921, H. E. Ewing collector. 

The foretarsus (figs. 45-46) is typically acerentomid (Tuxen 1955). 
The t 1 is placed proximally on the tarsus; d:p = 70:35( = 2). The 



EWING'S PROTTJRAN SPECIES — BONET AND TUXEN 285 

em podium is short; e:u = 8:28( = 0.3); a is long, c longer than b, 
d very long, and f much longer than g. The t 3 is long, lancetlike, 
t 1 long, claviform. The b' and c' are longer than a'. 

The chaetotaxy (figs. 47-50) schematically is as follows (pleurals as 
usual included in the tcrgals) :

It is characteristic that la in the posterior row of the terga is 
situated anteriorly to the other setae of the row (fig. 47) ; also charac- 
teristic are the setae missing in the anterior and posterior rows of the 
terga. The s VIII has two posterior setae. Ewing drew t VII and 
made a point of the next to lateral seta in the anterior row being 
situated "in front of and out of line with the other setae of the row." 
He did not realize, however, that the next to lateral seta in t VII is 
No. 4, while in the first six terga it is No. 3, which as usual is situated 
out of line, but behind the other setae of the row. 

The drawings of the chaetotaxy were made from two specimens 
determined by Bonct with the label Luray Cavern, Virginia, June 4, 
1948, E. W. Baker and F. Bonet collectors. The anterior apodeme 
is only slightly branched, not as much as shown by Ewing. 

The comb on abd. VIII (fig. 51) has about 10 equally long teeth. 
There is no other comb or row of teeth either on abd. V or VIII-X. 

The mouth parts of the holotype are drawn in figure 52. A short 
labrum is present, a mandible with a small split, pointed maxilla lobes, 
and a rather slender maxillary palpus. The whole as seen from the 
side and showing the chaetotaxy is drawn in figure 53 by Bonet. 

The filamento di sostegno is shown in figure 54 from the holotype and 
therefore from the side; it is short and without remarkable features. 

Because of the shape of the maxillary palpus (3-segmcnted, accord- 
ing to Berlese, i.e., without a limit between the outermost segment and 
the tusk of hairs on its tip) and the very small labrum, we are inclined 
to put the species in the genus Acerentulm without, however, having 
made up our minds as to the justification of keeping Acerentulus and 
Acerentomon apart, or even perhaps dividing them into more genera. 
In extreme cases there seems to be no doubt that the species belongs to 
one or the other genus, but some cases are doubtful. Therefore, for 
the present, the species should be called Acerentulus americanus 
(Ewing).

Acerentomon conurus Ewing 

Acerentomon conurus Ewing, 1921b, p. 197. — Ewing, 1940, p. 541. 

There are several slides determined by Ewing as conurus, among 
them the holotype, with the label, Takoma Park, Maryland, 
in decaying leaves and twigs, April 10, 1921, H. E. Ewing collector. 
The holotype specimen lies on this slide in such a way that the fore- 
tarsus appears to be very greatly shortened. The mutual size and 
placement of the sensillae therefore look different from those of 
Acerentulus americanus. It would be misleading to print the drawing 
of this foretarsus, as in fact there is no difference between the fore- 
tarsus of the other specimens of conurus and americanus. They are 
alike in every feature. 

The chaetotaxy, the comb of abd. VIII, the shape of the head, and 
the filamento di sostegno are also the same in every respect as they are 
in americanus. A small difference might be found in the placement of 
the. two small setae anteriorly and posteriorly to the pseudoculus. In 
americanus the distance of the two setae from the pseudoculus is the 
same ; in conurus the postocular seta is nearer to the pseudoculus than 
the preocular one. We should not like to make this difference, which 
might even be subject to individual variation, a specific character, 
however, and so we feel justified in stating that Acerentomon conurus 
Ewing is a synonym of Acerentulus americanus (Ewing), the latter 
name having priority.

The holotype female is the only specimen present, with the label, 
Utah, Salt Lake, dead leaves, Aug. 3, 1937, F. Andre collector. 

On the foretarus (figs. 55-56), t 1 has a curious shape, clavate but 
pointed; d:p = 99:34(=3.0); t 3 is long, lancetlike. All sensillae are 
long, including probably also d, which is broken; b and c are of the 
samel ength; f is much longer than g; f reaches halfway out on the claw. 
The a', b', and c' are also very long. The empodium is short; e:u = 
10:45(=0.2).

EWING'S PROTURAN SPECIES — BONET AND TUXEN 289 

Figure 57 gives the tergal chaetotaxy of the head and figure 58 that 
of the thorax; figures 59-60 give that of abd. II and VII; all were 
drawn by Bonet. 

The presence of a posterior row of setae in s VIII and a central seta 
in the posterior row of t VIII is important. 

A row of teeth is found on the hind margin of terga IX and X; 
about 20 small teeth are on t IX, and about 40 larger ones are on t X 
(fig. 61). The hind margins of the pleura and sterna of these segments 
also show rows of teeth (fig. 62). No row of teeth is present on the 
pleuron of abd. VIII or V. 

The comb of abd. VIII (fig. 63) consists of 7-8 long teeth. As is 
well known, this comb marks the lower border of the opening of the 
large abdominal glands. A row of quite small teeth is also present on 
the upper lid of this opening in the present species. 

There is a well developed labrum, nearly one-fourth the length of 
the head (fig. 64). The maxillary palpi are long and the outermost 
tusk of each seta is clearly defined as a fourth segment. All long 
setae of the head are extremely long. 

The filamento di sostegno (fig. 65) is short. 

The species belongs, without doubt, to the genus Acerentomon as 
defined by Berlese (1909). 

Acerentomon christensoni Ewing 

Figures 66-69 
Acerentomon chrislensoni Ewing, 1940, p. 537. 

Several slides of this species are present. We have made descrip- 
tions and drawings from the type slide which contains 4 females, and 
a paratype slide with 3 females. Data of the type slide are, Brigham, 
Utah, in peach orchard soil, April 20, 1938, L. D. Christenson collector. 
The paratype slide bears the data, Medford, Oregon, in peach orchard 
soil, Sept. 12, 1938, L. D. Christenson collector. 

The exterior side of the foretarsus (figs. 66-67) was drawn from a 
specimen on the type slide, of one of the paratypes. The t 1 is clavate, 
t 3 long, lancetlike. The difference from Acerentulus americanvs is 
seen in b being longer than c, g longer than f, d short; and what is very 
remarkable, a' is broad and long, and a small a" (=/31) is present. 
In all these characters the foretarsus resembles that of Acerentulus

confinis Berlese as reexamined by Tuxen (1956a). The broad a' 
seems to be very characteristic of this species. 

The chaetotaxy is exactly like that of confinis; therefore, we shall 
not give it in detail. Also the shape of the apodemes is the same. 

The comb of abd. VIII (fig. 68) is drawn from one of the specimens 
on the type slide, because it seems to be a little different from that of 
confinis. There are the same number of teeth, about 12, but Tuxen 
(1956a, p. 232) states that one of the central teeth of confinis is longer 
than the rest; this condition is not so in christensoni. We do not, 
however, consider this difference important. 

The head (fig. 69) is drawn by Bonet from a specimen on the type 
slide; it is a typical Acerentulus head. 

The filamento di sostegno is exactly like that of confinis. 

Thus we conclude that Acerentomon christensoni is identical with 
Acerentulus confinis Berlese and should be lowered to the rank of a 
synonym. 

Acerentomon occidentalis Ewing 

Figures 70-76 
Acerentomon occidentalis Ewing, 1940, p. 540. 

There are three slides present of this species, the holotype and two 
paratypes. All three specimens are females and bear the data, 
floor of Yosemite Valley, California, in decaying leaves and twigs, 
April 15, 1927, H. E. Ewing collector. Our drawings are from the 
holotype and one paratype. 

The foretarsus (figs. 70-71) is extremely broad and short compared 
with the foretarsi of other acerentomids known to us. The ratio of 
the claw to the rest of the tarsus is 53: 150, i.e., nearly 1 :3; in Aceren- 
tulus americanus, for instance, it is 32:105, i.e., 1:3.5; this ratio is 
more common. Also the ratio of breadth to length of foretarsus 
(without pretarsus) is 45:140, about 1:3; in americanus it is 20:100 
or 1:5, as is more or less the case in the other species. This ratio, 
however, is only discernible if the specimen is seen from the side, not 
from above or below. The t 1 is long and slender, not clavate, placed 
exactly in the middle of the tarsus; d:p = 70:70. The t 3 is long, 
lancet shaped; b is much longer than c; d and f are long, e and g short. 
On the interior side a' is missing; b' is a little broader and shorter 
than c'.

The chaetotaxy (figs. 72-73) schematically is as follows:

•> "3" Is missing. 

• "4" in the paratype, "5" In the holotype; both are probably abnormal. 

d "4" in the paratype, probably abnormal; "5" in the holotype. 

There is some difference between the holotype and one of the para- 
types, due, no doubt, to individual variation. 

Very characteristic are several rows of small teeth on the hind margin 
of abd. IX-XI, as follows: 

s IX: about 6 small teeth dispersed outside the outer setae. 

s X: teeth dispersed all along the hind margin. 

t IX: about 6 teeth dispersed between the inner setae. 

t X-XI : closely set teeth all along the hind margin. 

The comb of abd. VIII (fig. 74) possesses about 12 rather long teeth 
of equal length. The upper lid of the opening of the abdominal 
glands bears small teeth like those in Acerentomon andrei. 

The species has a small labrum (fig. 75). The maxillary palpi are 
not distinct either in the holotype or in the paratype. 

The filamento di sostegno (fig. 76) is very small. 

The presence of a labrum, though short, and the many teeth on the 
hindmost segments, we think, justify retaining this species in the 
genus Acerentomon, where it is a junior synonym of A. californicum 
(Hilton). 

Acerentulus californicus Hilton 

Acerentulus californicus Hilton, 1929, p. 132. 
Acerentulus ba?beri californicus, Ewing, 1940, p. 550. 

In 1929 Hilton described Acerentulus californicus and gave two 
figures. These figures, however, give only the general shape and 
numerous setae, which are often wrongly placed and far too few to be 
of any value in identifying the species. The description is short and 
does not contain anything which would not fit any acerentomid. 
The type is said to be in the Pomona College collection. 

Ewing (1940) made a new description based on a female specimen 
sent to him by Hilton and part of some material from the type locality. 

We both independently wrote to Professor Hilton asking him 
about his types. He replied that he had been unable to locate the 
types, but that he had sent some specimens to the U.S. National 
Museum, and that he did not possess any more material. Hilton's 
types of Acerentulus americanus (Tuxen 1955, p. 125) and A. cali- 



EWING'S PROTURAN SPECIES — BONET AND TUXEN 295 

fornicus are not in the U.S. National Museum, as we both had the 
opportunity of ascertaining when we were in Washington. They 
must therefore be regarded as lost. 

The californicus slide on which Ewing based his short redescription, 
however, is present. It bears the label in Hilton's writing, A. calif. 
9 Cobell's Canyon, Calif., Jan. 1938. As this seems to be the only 
known specimen of the species, and as it was determined by Hilton, 
we designate it as a neotype. It is a well preserved female, cleared 
and stained. 

Now it appears that this specimen is exactly identical with the type 
of Acerentomon occidentalis Ewing. The foretarsi are visible from 
above and therefore do not appear to be as broad as those in the type 
specimen of this species, but all sensillae are visible and of the same 
length and position as in occidentalis. The chaetotaxy is exactly alike, 
the only differences being within the range of variability (see above), 
viz., s II-III = %, s VI = %. The teeth on t IX-XI and s IX-X 
are exactly alike, as are the labrum and the filamento di sostegno. 
It is impossible for us to see any difference, and so we must state that 
Acerentulus californicus Hilton is a synonym of Acerentomon occi- 
dentalis Ewing. As californicus is the older name, it has priority in 
spite of the poor description given by Hilton. Thus, the species should 
be called Acerentomon californicum (Hilton). 

Acerentulus barberi Ewing 

Figures 77-83 

Acerentulus barberi Ewing, 1921a, p. 240. 
Acerentulus tenuiceps Ewing, 1921b, p. 198. 
Acerentulus barberi barberi Ewing, 1940, p. 549. 

This was the first American proturan to be described after Sil- 
vestri's E. wheeleri. There are many slides in the collection, some of 
them marked barberi and others tenuiceps. Ewing realized in 1940 
that these two species described by him were identical. Then he 
called the species barberi barberi, as he thought Hilton's californicus 
was a variety of it. It has been shown above, however, that this 
is correct; so the species should keep its binary name. 

The holotype bears the label, Takoma Park, Maryland, Feb. 14, 
1921, from decaying leaves, H. E. Ewing collector. In addition to the 
holotype, we examined a male and a female determined as barberi 
and labeled, Chesterville, Illinois, Oct. 18, 1921, in decaying leaves 
and twigs, killed Nov. 7, 1921, H. E. Ewing collector (we will call 
these "specimens 2 and 3"), and also a male and a female determined 
as tenuiceps, but corrected by Ewing to barberi and bearing the label, 
Takoma Park, Maryland, April 3, 1921, from decaying leaves, H. E. 
Ewing collector (we, will call these "specimens 4 and 5").

The foretarsus (figs. 77-78) is characterized by 1 1 being long and 
slender, not clavate, and placed proximally on the tarsus; d:p = 
85:45(=2); t 2 is longer and more slender than t 1; t 3 short, lancet- 
like. Exteriorly the long and broadly spindle-shaped a is noticeable; 
interiorly the very long a' (erroneously, b' on fig. 88) is also noticeable; 
b' is missing; e is placed in the middle between d and f; f and g are 
near each other. Also peculiar is the very long seta 5 4. The empo- 
dium is a little more than half the claw; e:u = 35:G5. 

The chaetotaxy schematically is as follows (the pleurals as usual are 
included in the tergals; the dorsal chaetotaxy of head and thorax are 
shown in fig. 79, of the holot3^pe; figs. 80-81 were made from speci- 
men 2) :

There is a small variability among the five specimens. In the 
anterior row of t VI, one specimen has only nine setae, one even eight. 
In t VII, two specimens have nine setae. Two specimens have only 
two setae in the posterior row of s I. 

Unfortunately in all specimens the outermost segments (IX-XII) 
were pulled so closely together, that it was impossible to make clear 
drawings of them. 

The comb of abd. VIII (fig. 82) consists of 10 rather long and 
irregular teeth. 

The filamento di sostegno (fig. 83) is very short. 

The species is without a labrum and has short, blunt, three-seg- 
mented maxillary palpi. It belongs without doubt to Berlese's genus 
Acerentulus. 

Acerentulus oculatus Ewing 

Figures 84-85 
Acerentulus oculatus Ewing, 1921b, p. 198;1940, p. 545. 

Only a few specimens arc present. We have examined the holotype, 
a female labeled, Takoma Park, Maryland, from decaying leaves, 
March 6, 1921, H. E. Ewing collector; and another specimen labeled, 
male, taken in copula in breeding cell, March 4, 1922. 

It appears that in nearly all characters the specimens are identical 
with the specimens of Acerentulus barberi. In the foretarsus the char- 
acteristic spindle-shaped a, the long and slender 1 1, the extraordinarily 



EWING'S PROTURAN SPECIES — BONET AND TUXEN 299 

long 6 4 show the identity with barberi. Jn tho chaetotaxy the only 
difference from the scheme given for barberi is that only 2 setae are 
found in the posterior row of s I, but this variation was also found in 
specimens of barberi. 

The only other difference is found in the shape of the comb of abd. 
Y!II (fig. 84). The innermost pari is separated as a small lobe with 
4-5 very small teeth. We have never seen this feature before in any 
acerentomid and cannot say if it is an individual variation, which we 
think most probable, or a specific character. It was found in both 
specimens examined. 

The specimen taken in copula has a distended copulatory apparatus, 
which we have drawn (fig. 85), as it shows the shape and chaetota.\\ of 
this organ very distinctly. 

Thus we conclude that Acerentulus oculatus Ewing is synonymous 
with A. barberi Ewing, the latter name having priority. 

Acerentulus bicolor Ewing 

Figure 86 

Acerentitloides bicolor Ewing, 1921b, p. 199. 
Acerentulus bicolor Ewing, 1940, p. 543. 

Four slides are present in the series of this species, but two of 
them (from Florida) are Acerentulus floridanus Ewing. The holotype 
of bicolor is labeled, Takoma Park, Maryland, in decaying leaves and 
twigs, April 10, 1921, II. E. Ewing collector. It is a male preimago. 
The paratype, with the same label but only dated 1921, is a maturus 
junior. We have examined these two specimens. 

Tho foretarsus is exactly like that of Acerentulus americanu s, except 
that in the holotype b is a little longer than c; in americanus the oppo- 
site is the case. The chaetotaxy, abdominal comb, and filamento di 
sostegno are all alike. 

Womersley in 1927 abandoned the genus Acerentuloides as based on 
immature specimens. Ewing in 1936 kept the genus, saying that it 
was based on a female, but abandoned it in 1940 as based upon 
variable characters. In fact the holotype is not a female, but a 
preimaginal male (fig. 86), a mistake which even Berlese made 
{Acerentulus cephalotes, see Tuxen, 1956a, p. 234). 

Unfortunately Bonet did not give the setae in his drawing of the 
squama genitalis, and Tuxen forgot to correct this when in Washington. 

It is therefore concluded that not only the genus Acerentuloides 
should be abandoned, but also the specific name bicolor Ewing, due 
to the following synonymy : Acerentuloides bicolor Ytv;'mg= Acerentulus 
americanus (Ewing).

We have examined and made drawings of two specimens of this 
species, the holotype, a female, and a paratype with extended female 
genitalia; both specimens are labeled, Orlando, Florida, May 26, 1922, 
in decaying leaves and twigs, H. E. Ewing collector. 

The foretarsus (figs. 87-88) has a clavate t 1 and a small, rather 
blunt, lancetlike t3; d:p=84:40(=2.10). The most characteristic 
features are the very long sensillae b and c, and the short f and g; f and 
g are rather close; e is in the middle between d and f; b' is missing 
(a' given erroneously as b' in fig. 88). The empodium is short; 
e:u=4:27(=0.15).

The comb of abd. VIII (fig. 92) is very peculiar, having teeth which 
appear to be coalesced nearly to the tip. There are about 8-10 teeth, 
and only the outermost tips of them are free, but their borders seem 
to be visible within the lamina. 

The filamento di sostegno (fig. 93) is very short. 

The characters mentioned are identical in the two specimens and 
there seems to be no doubt about the specific rank of the species on 
account of the large sensillae b and c of the foretarsus and the very 
characteristic comb. The species belongs to the genus Acerentulus. 

Acerentulus aureitarsus Ewing

near Prospect Hill, Virginia, Sept. 25, 1921, in decaying leaves and 
twigs, H. E. Ewing collector. We have also examined four specimens 
determined by Bonet with the label, Dead Run, Virginia, May 29,

The specimens determined by Bonet agree with the holotype in 
every character (sensillae of foretarsus, comb, filamento di sostegno, 
teeth on hind border of terga X and XI), except in the chaetotaxy; 
as they are mature specimens, however, we shall give the chaetotaxy 
on the basis of them, and show afterward the deviation from the 
holotype. 

On the foretarus (figs. 94-95), t 1 is long and slender, not clavate; 
t3 long, lancetlike; d:p = 75:50(=1.5). The e is rather short and 
situated extraordinarily near d; f is much longer than g. The a' is 
missing. The empodium is small; e:u=9:46(=0.2). 

The chaetotaxy (figs. 96-97) schematically is as follows:

b "3a" is missing. 





















The chaetotaxy of the holotype differs in the following points: 
s I posterior row, 2 setae (in all other specimens, including the para- 
type, 4 setae); s III-V anterior row, 3 setae (also in the paratype; in 
the other specimens, 5 setae) ; s VI anterior row, 4 setae (which must 
be abnormal). 

It is remarkable that the microchaeta "3a" is present in t II-VI 
(fig. 99). Another unique feature is the difference between the 
number of setae in the anterior row of sll and sill, a difference which 
does not seem to develop until the adult stage. 

On the hind margin of t X and t XI there is a row of fine teeth which 
are smaller in the maturi juniores and larger in the adults (fig. 100). 
No teeth are visible on the sterna. 

The comb of abd. VIII (fig. 101) is remarkable in that its median 
tooth is broad and has a small secondary tooth in the middle; there 
are 7-8 teeth. 

The filamento di sostegno (fig. 102) is rather long, with a large 
spherical bulb at the end; the swelling is not smooth but verrucous. 

The head (fig. 103) shows a very small labrum; however, this condi- 
tion does not justify transferring the species to Acerentomon. The 
palpi maxillarcs are distinctly like those of Acerentulus.

STUDIES IN NEOTROPICAL MALLOPHAGA, XVII: A NEW 

FAMILY (TROCHILIP1IAGIDAE) AND A NEW GENUS 

OF THE LICE OF HUMMINGBIRDS 



By M. A. Carriker, Jr. 



I wish to express my thanks to Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke and other 
members of the Division of Entomology of the U.S. National Museum 
for having reviewed a preliminary draft of parts of the present paper. 
My thanks are also due to Colonel K. C. Emerson for the loan of 
material and other assistance. All measurements are in millimeters. 
I drew all illustrations accurately to scale by means of an eye-piece 
micrometer with a No. 10 eye piece, Nos. 16 and 4 objectives. 

On the basis of the nomenclature now currently applied to the 
Mallophaga of the Trochilidae, two genera of the suborder Amblycera 
are normally but not abundantly found on the Trochilidae: Tro- 
chiloecetes and Ricinus. The former are known only from the Tro- 
chilidae, but the latter are common parasites of many species of passer- 
ine birds. Any other genus of Mallophaga which may have been 
recorded from the hummingbirds are patently stragglers and should 
be disregarded. 

The genus Trochiloecetes is the more abundant of the two. I 
have specimens of it from 32 species of hosts ranging from Mexico 
to Bolivia, whereas I have taken Ricinus-\ike forms from only 20 
species of hosts. Only 4 species of hummingbirds have yielded both 
genera of lice, and only once have both genera been taken on the

same individual host. Specimens of the males of both genera are 
extremely rare. There are in my collection only 7 species of Tro- 
chiloecetes represented by males, and only 1 species of the Ricinus-like 
form, it being represented by two males (from Selasphorus flammula) . 

Generally speaking, Trochiloecetes and Ricinus are not strikingly 
different in appearance, except in the shape of the head and pro- 
thorax, and in the male genitalia. In overall appearance the species 
of Ricinus which parasitize the hummingbirds resemble closely a 
few species of the genus found on other families of hosts. The 
mouth parts, however, are entirely different and resemble those of 
Trochiloecetes. 

The first species of Trochiloecetes to be described was prominens, 
under the old generic term of Physostomum, from Calypte costae. In 
1903 doratophorus was described by the present author from Selaspho- 
rus flammula. In 1913 Paine and Mann described a third species, 
emiliae, and placed it in the new genus Trochiloecetes. They desig- 
nated Physostomum prominens Kellogg and Chapman the type of this 
new genus. A fourth species, ochoterenai, was described by Zavaleta 
in 1943, from Selasphorus rufus of Mexico, but the status of this 
species is in doubt, as will be explained below. 

Meanwhile, none of the various authors who had worked with 
the genus seem to have noted that the mouth parts were entirely 
different from those of all other Mallophaga. In 1949 Clay published 
a short article which briefly described the differences and showed 
that the mandibles are not of the ordinary chewing type, but of a 
piercing character. 1 This condition would seem to be ample proof 
that this insect feeds on blood instead of feathers and scales of skin; 
however, the theory was further substantiated by the presence of a 
long, slender tube lying between the mandibles, the tube apparently 
used for sucking blood from the punctures or scarifications made by 
the pointed mandibles (see fig. la). Clay has elaborated somewhat 
on the details of these structures and has advanced theories as to their 
origin. 

As stated above, the species of Ricinus (auct.) found on the Tro- 
chilidae possess mouth parts similar to those of Trochiloecetes (see 
fig. 1/), but quite different from those of the species of Ricinus 
(auct.) found on other families of birds. These mouth parts are of 
a somewhat different type than those of other genera of Amblycera, 
the differences being in the tj^pe of articulation and in the absence 
of "teeth" on the inner side of the mandibles in Ricinus. 

Some forms of Ricinus (auct.) have mandibles that are exceedingly 
minute (Dysthamnus mentalis, fig. 16), but not more so than in some 
other genera of Amblycera, and others (Phlerjopsis n. nigromaculatus,

fig. lc and Thraupis virens episcopus, fig. le) have fairly large 
mandibles, but none possess the serrated inner surfaces. 

In Trochiloecetes the mandibles are without visible condyles. The 
anterior portion, at the angle of the "L," is fused with a small pro- 
jection on the inner side of the marginal carina, just in front of the 
palpi. The long, posterior tip seems to be without support; it moves 
transversely along a short band projecting from the premarginal nodus, 
but it probably has a muscular attachment to the band, a condition 
that would allow a forward and backward movement of the pointed, 
anterior portion of the "L." 

In species of Ricinus (auct.) the mandibular condyles differ 
greatly in the amount of their development. Those from Phlegopsis 
have well developed articulations (see fig. lc), especially of the 
anterior condyle, while those from Dysthamnus (typical of the small 
mandible type) have the articulation rudimentary, but nevertheless 
present. 

In all the species of Trochiloecetes that I have examined there is a great 
similarity in the shape and situation of the mandibles, as may be 
seen from the figures of the species described on succeeding pages. 

Although Clay asserts that the tip of the left mandible is bipartite, 
I have not been able to confirm this statement. It is true that the 
tip of the left mandible in Ricinus (auct.) is bipartite, but apparently 
it is not in Trochiloecetes. 

Clay states further: "There are three closely associated stylet- 
like structures, almost certainly of hypopharyngeal origin, which are 
joined by a common membrane, only the distal ends being free." 
Actually, the median stylet is the sucking tube, while the two lateral 
ones form the sheath that supports and shields it. This structure is 
not always clearly visible, but in some specimens all details are clearly 
defined. There is considerable variation in the details of these struc- 
tures, but generally speaking the same pattern is found throughout 
the genus. 

Clay mentions the outgrowths from the dorsal wall of the preoral 
cavity as forming a groove to hold and guide the hypopharyngeal 
apparatus, but this is slightly misleading. These outgrowths are the 
anchorages to which are fused the sides of the collarlike structure, 
and it is through this structure that the hypopharyngeal apparatus 
is protruded and retracted. Clay also states: "The mandibles are 
lightly sclerotized and the piercing blades lie parallel to the median 
structure." The long, posterior portion of the mandibles does lie 
parallel to the sucking apparatus, but the actual piercing blades are 
at the anterior end, pointing inward, at right angles to the median 
structure. The mandibles are L-shaped, the long arm pointing back- 
ward and the short, piercing blade pointing inward. 



LOUSE FAMILY TROCHILIPHAGIDAE — CARRIKER 311 

Undoubtedly the genus Ricinus is the progenitor of the abnormal, 
Ricinus-likc form found on the Trochilidae, as well as the more dis- 
similar Trochiloecetes, since both of these forms are unquestionably 
blood-sucking parasites and hence degenerates. Further support for 
this theory is found in the presence of Ricinus on such a large and 
varied number of hosts, while the blood-sucking degenerates are 
found only on the Trochilidae. 

In my own collection I have specimens of Ricinus from 16 passerine 
families embracing 101 genera and 136 species. Three records from 
nonpasserine hosts have been discarded as being probable stragglers. 

The original Ricinus-like form must have been parasitic on the 
progenitor of the hummingbirds at a very early stage of its existence, 
and, not finding their type of feathers suitable food, must have gradu- 
ally developed the present type of piercing mandibles and the very 
complicated sucking apparatus, an evolutionary process which must 
have been extremely slow. 

Such a difference in the most basic anatomical character of these 
insects certainly entitles the group to special nomenclatural distinction. 
I therefore propose a new family for the two groups parasitic on the 
Trochilidae, viz., the genus Trichiloecetes and those species which are 
now called (incorrectly) Ricinus but which should be given generic 
distinction. 

Suborder Amblycera Kellogg, 1896 

Family Trochiliphagidae, new family 

Type genus: Trochiloecetes Paine and Mann. 

The outstanding characters of this family are the minute, more or 
less fixed, piercing or scarifying mandibles and the complicated 
sucking apparatus lying between them. The mandibles of Tro- 
chiloecetes are L-shaped, with their attachment at the angle of the 
L, the short piercing arm pointing inward and the long arm backward 
(for further details see under the genus, below) . 

The mandibles of the new genus, Trochiliphagus are minute, roughly 
cone-shaped, with irregular outline and usually blunt points and with 
bases fused to the nodi, to which are attached the palpi (see also fig. 2). 

The sucking apparatus is supported by a very complicated frame- 
work, differing considerably from species to species. The sucking 
portion consists of a needlelike tube, tapering slightly to a slender 
point and lying within a sheath open at the apical end. The sheath 
is composed of two portions separated distally and ending in very 
slender tips, so that there seems to be three stylets. 

The sucking apparatus bears a certain resemblance to that found in 
Anoplura. In the new family, however, the sucking apparatus lies 
completely within the head, is accompanied by a pair of piercing

Trochiloecetes prominens (Kellogg andChapman), 1899 

Physostomum prominens Kellogg and Chapman, Occ. Pap. California Acad. Sci., 
vol. 6, p. 137, pi. 9, fig. 5, 1899. Host: Calyple cosine (Bourcier). 

With a transverse frons and length of 2.00, this species falls in the 
key between sections A and B, and could be included in either. 
Placed under section A, it would go with angustifrons under a', but 
it differs decidedly from that species in the much wider frons, the 
sides of which are rounded, not divergent; temples moderately convex 
laterally, occiput only slightly sinuate. I have examined the type, 
which is almost adult, but recently molted. The authors 
attribute the fading out of the submarginal, abdominal carinae 
posteriorly to immaturity, but this assumption is incorrect, the 
fading out being a universal character.

of sucking apparatus, with basal support, measures 0.26; head at 
temples 0.52X0.61; Irons 0.40. The type, a female, is in the collec- 
tion of the author; also 1 9 paratype. When this species was de- 
scribed, the author remarked that it was being provisionally placed in 
the genus Physostomum, since a closely related species (prominens) 
had been placed there by Dr. Kellogg, but in the opinion of the 
author, further collecting from hummingbirds would produce addi- 
tional species upon which a new genus could be safely erected. Ten 
years later this new genus was described by Paine and Mann. 

Trochiloecetes emiliae Paine and Mann, 1913 

Trochiloeceles emiliae Paine and Mann, Psyche, vol. 20, p. 21, fig. 5, 1913. Host: 
Thalurania (furcala) furcatoides Gould. 

Without seeing the type it is difficult to place this species in the 
key. However, it falls into Section B, c' , with doratophorum, but 
has a smaller head than this species (0.52X0.56 against 0.55X 
0.61). The head is longer at the occiput than at the temples; the 
transverse frontal carina is very short (if the figure given is correct) ; 
it falls far short of the lateral margins of the head (a very unusual 
condition if true). The author gives incorrect measurements for 
doratophorum, perhaps because he compared emiliae with some 
species wrongly identified as that form.

Trochiloecetes ochoternai Zavaleta, Tesis Univ. Mexico, Fac. Sci., Dept. Biol.,

I have been unable to secure a copy of the description of this 
species. Colonel Emerson sent me from its host a pair of specimens 
that he supposed were the Trochiloecetes in question, but unfortu- 
nately they proved to be species of the Ricinus-like genus described 
on succeeding pages of this paper. It is not impossible that both 
Trochiloecetes and Trochilophagus (the new genus) would be found 
on the same host, since I have them both from Selasphorus flammula. 
Until further information can be secured concerning the species, it 
may be provisionally left in Trochiloecetes.

TrochiliphagiiSi new genus 

Type species: Trochiliphagus lazulus, new species. 

Diagnosis : Similar to certain species of Ricinus in general shape and 
structure of the head, thorax, and abdomen, but with the same type 
of sucking mouth parts as in Trochiloecetes. The mandibles, instead 
of being L-shaped, as in Trochiloecetes, consist of minute, tapering 
sclerites, often of irregular shape and with the distal end varying 
between a point and a rounded tip. Their bases are attached to the 
inner edge of the premarginal carinae, the attachment apparently 
being flexible (see figs. 1/ and 2). 

The sucking apparatus is smaller than in Trochiloecetes and with 
certain differences in structure clearly illustrated in figure 1, a and/. 
There is a generic conformity in the general shape of the head and in 
the absence of darker markings, following the type of Ricinus micro- 
cephalum Kellogg, except that the head is longer and usually narrower 
at the temples. 

The thoracic and abdominal structure is similiar to the genus 
Ricinus. I have two males of this genus from Selasphorus Jlammula, 
the same individual host from which was taken the type of Trochiloe- 
cetes doratophorus. These genitalia are very similiar to those of 
Trochiloecetes columbianus, and not at all like those of Ricinus, of 
which I have examined numerous specimens, and of which a figure is 
presented (see fig. 12c-e). 

The labral lobes are alwa} T s well developed, often enormously ex- 
panded, curving forward to the line of the frons. Even those of lesser 
development protrude noticeably beyond the lateral margins of the 
head.

I have examined two females of a Troehiliphagus from Selasphorus 
rufus from the collection of Col. Emerson. One is fully adult, the 
other slightly immature. They are extremely close to T. irazuensis 
(Carriker), from S. flammula, the actual differences being too small 
to merit nomenclatural recognition.

Body length 2.54 against 2.57; head (temples) 0.62X0.58 against 
0.63X0.64; frons 0.29 against 0.29; prothorax 0.40X0.58 against 
0.36X0.62; pterothorax 0.43X0.78 against 0.43X0.80; abdomen 
1.32X0.91 against 1.39X0.95. There are but two differences of 
any importance — viz, width of head at temples (0.58 against 0.64) 
and the prothorax, which is longer and narrower. The details of the 
sucking apparatus are not clearly defined either in the type of 
irazuensis or in the specimens from S. rufus, but those visible seem 
to be identical, as well as the transverse, frontal carina, the pleurites, 
and the submarginal abdominal carinae. The two hosts are closely 
related, and it would serve no useful purpose to attempt their 
separation. 

The uncertainty surrounding the generic position of T. ochoterenai 
makes it impossible for me to allocate that species genericalty. I 
have not been able to see a copy of the description, and while the 
species was placed under Trochiloecetes in the 1952 "Checklist of 
Genera and Species of Mallophaga" (Hopkins and Clay) ; there is some 
doubt of its correctness. If it is actually a Trochiloecetes, it may 
well be a synonym of T. doratophorum (Carriker), from Selasphorus 
flammula, since the species of Trochiliphagus from these two hosts 
are practically the same. If it is a Trochiliphagus, it would then 
probably be a synonym of T. irazuensis (Carriker) 

Physostomum lineatum Osborn, 1896 

Physostomum lineatum. Osborn, Bull. U.S. Bur. Ent., n.s., p. 248, 1896. Host: 
Trochilvs colubris Linne. 

This species was placed under the genus Ricinus in Hopkins' and 
Clay's 1952 checklist. Dr. Osborn says that three specimens were 
sent to him for identification from Cornell University. I communi- 
cated with Dr. Dietrich, Curator of Entomology of the Museum of 
Zoology at Cornell, and he informed me that he has not been able 
to find any of Osborn's types described in the 1896 paper, and has 
no idea where they may be located. Osborn stated that the specimens 
had been returned to Cornell. 

A careful scrutiny of Osborn's description of this species shows 
that it could not have been a Trochiloecetes and that it was either a Tro- 
chiliphagus or else a true Ricinus, with a wrongly labelled host. He 
says: "Front rounded, with a few short hairs; palettes small; lateral 
angles of temples produced; prothorax widening a little behind and 
posterior margin concave." None of these characters would apply 
to Trochiloecetes. 1 suggest that it was a Trochiliphagus, since no 
mention was made of any darker markings on the sides of the head, 
a common character in many species of Ricinus.

THE PELAGIC AMPIIIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO 

(HYPERIIDEA : HYPERIIDAE) IN THE 
NORTH PACIFIC AND ADJACENT ARCTIC OCEAN 



By Thomas E. Bowman 



Among the marine planktonic Crustacea, the amphipods frequently 
play an important role in the economy of the sea. In general they 
rank third in numerical abundance; they are far exceeded by the cope- 
pods and euphausiids. In tropical and subtropical regions pelagic 
amphipods are not usually found in large numbers, but in the cooler 
parts of the oceans they are often extremely abundant. Members of 
the genus Parathemisto (=Themisto auct.) overwhelmingly dominate 
the cool-water epipelagic amphipod fauna, and their importance in 
the north Atlantic (including the Arctic Atlantic) has been pointed 
out by Bigelow (1926), Bigelow and Sears (1939), Stephensen (1923, 
1924), and Dunbar (1946, 1957). Only cursory attention has been 
given to north Pacific representatives. The present paper is an at- 
tempt to fill in a few gaps in our knowledge of the distribution and 
life history of species of Parathemisto in the north Pacific and the 
Arctic Ocean north of Alaska and western Canada. 

The amphipods upon which this report is based were obtained from 
plankton collections from several sources: (1) Off the Pacific coast 
of the United States from the latitude of the Columbia River to that 
of Punta Eugenia in middle Baja California, in connection with the 
California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CCOFI). (2)

The Northern Holiday Expedition of the Scripps Institution of Ocean- 
ography, August and September 1951. (3) Cruises of the United 
States Fisheries steamer Albatross in the northern Pacific. (4) Cruises 
of the U.S.S. Burton Island to the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas during 
August 1950 and August and September 1951, and to Amundsen Gulf 
and Prince of Wales Strait during August 1953. (5) Northern Pacific 
stations of cruise VII of the Carnegie, 1928-29. (6) Samples from 
Japanese waters, sent to me by Dr. Sigeru Motoda and Mr. Zinziro 
Nakai. (7) Samples from Korean waters provided by Mr. Won Tack 
Yang. 

Five species of Parathemisto were obtained from these collections. 
Each species is considered separately below with respect to its tax- 
onomy, distribution, and ecolog} 7 . A sixth species, doubtfully identi- 
fied from the Yellow Sea by Yamada, is also considered. 

Much of the work reported herein was carried out under the super- 
vision of Dr. Martin W. Johnson, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
to whom I am grateful for many valuable suggestions and for for- 
warding to me the amphipods from the 1951 Burton Island Cruise. 
Dr. Robert Bieri, Antioch College, kindly sent me the amphipods from 
the 1953 Burton Island Cruise. I also wish to thank Dr. Sigeru 
Motoda, Hokkaido University, and Mr. Zinziro Nakai, Tokai Re- 
gional Research Laboratory, for sending me specimens of Parathemisto 
from Japanese waters. Mr. Won Tack Yang, Central Fisheries Ex- 
periment Station, Pusan, obligingly sent me specimens from several 
localities around Korea. Dr. Isabella Gordon, British Museum (Nat- 
ural History), made it possible for me to examine Challenger specimens 
of Parathemisto pacifica Stebbing.

diagnosis (family characters omitted): Head moderately large, 
globular. Pi (pereopod 1) simple. P2 chelate; carpal process narrow, 
concave on anterior margin. Carpus of P3 and P4 more or less di- 
lated, forming a prehensile organ with propodus. P5-7 longer than 
P3 and P4. Uropods narrow, elongate. Type species, by monotypy, 
Themisto gaudichaudii Guerin. 

In 1870 Boeck established the genus Parathemisto, which was to be 
distinguished from Themisto Guerin by P5 not being much longer than 
P6 or P7. Noting that Themisto had been preoccupied in 1815 by a 
nudibranch mollusk, Bovallius (1887) changed the amphipod name to 
Euthemisto. Stephensen (1924) combined the two genera, since the 
relative lengths of P5-7 of the male of Themisto gracilipes Norman 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 345 

placed it in Euthemisto, while the female had to be referred to Para- 
themisto. In combining the two genera, Stephensen returned to the 
oldest generic name, apparently not realizing that it had been pre- 
occupied. K. H. Barnard (1930) pointed out that Themisto was not 
available and that Bocck's name had to be used. In spite of this, 
some authors continue to refer to the genus as Themisto. 

K. H. Barnard (1930) retains Parathemisto and Euthemisto as sub- 
genera of Parathemisto, a course which is followed by Hurley (1955) 
and Vinogradov (1956). I believe this is the most satisfactory way 
to deal with this group of amphipods. Although the differences 
between Euthemisto and Parathemisto are sufficiently clear cut so that 
there is no difficulty in assigning all the known species to one or the 
other, they are not as great as those which separate the other genera 
of the family Hyperiidae. 

Keys to species of Parathemisto have been given by Barnard (1930, 
p. 420), Stephensen (1923, p. 19, European species), and Hurley 
(1955, New Zealand species).

Diagnosis: Total length of adult 9, excluding antennae, 4.5-8.5 
mm. Body more chunky in appearance than in most species of 
Parathemisto. Dorsal to antennal groove head is less roundly pro- 
duced in lateral view than in P. abyssorum, i.e., slope of this part of 
head is directed more posteriad than in P. abyssorum. Pleonites with 
a few minute teeth along ventral margins, posterior lateral corners 
produced into small points. Female antenna 2 about as long as 
antenna 1, slightly shorter than head plus first 2 pereonites. Molar 
process of mandible about twice as long as incisor process. Max- 
illiped with row of long spines at distal end of basal pJate. Propodus 
of Pi serrate but not spinous on posterior margin. In length 
P6>P7>P5. Posterior distal corners of carpus of P6-7, but not 
of P5, with conspicuous spines. Dactyls of P5-6 pectinate at base. 
Peduncle of uropod 3 from 2 to 2.5 times as long as telson. 

Kemarks: K. H. Barnard (1930, p. 419) suggested that Stebbing's 
P. pacifica was a synonym of P. japonica. Barnard did not have 
specimens of either species, and his conclusion was a reasonable one 
to draw from a comparison of the descriptions by Bovallius and 
Stebbing. I suspect that Stebbing would have reached the same 
conclusion, for at the time he described P. pacifica, Bovallius had 
published only a brief, unillustrated description of P. japonica. If 
Bovallius' more detailed and illustrated description published in 1889 
had been available to Stebbing, he might not have described P. pa- 
cifica as a separate species, for the differences emphasized by Stebbing 
and listed below are actually not valid for distinguishing the two 
species : 

1. The propodus of P3 of P. pacifica is longer than the carpus and 
is pectinate rather than smooth on the posterior margin. While 
Bovallius (1889) states that the propodus is a little shorter than the 
carpus, he also says that the propodus is finely pectinated, and in 
his figure 35, plate 12, it is shown as pectinate and slightly longer 
than the carpus. 

2. In P. pacifica, the outer ramus of uropod 3 is shorter than the 
inner ramus. Although Bovallius (1889) states that the two rami 
are of equal length in P. japonica, his figure 43, plate 12, shows the 
outer one to be slightly shorter. Stebbing does not say how much 
shorter the outer ramus of P. pacifica is, and provides no figures. In 
my specimens of P. japonica and P. pacifica, the outer ramus is slightly 
shorter. 

Although the above criteria are worthless for distinguishing between 
P. pacifica and P. japonica, I nevertheless consider them as distinct

but very closely related species, which may be told apart by the larger 
size, greater development of the pereopodal setae, and unequal anten- 
nae of P. japonica. In addition to the small morphological differ- 
ences, the two species have different geographical distributions. P. 
japonica occurs in the Japan and Okhotsk Seas and in a limited region 
east of Japan and the southern Kuriles; P. pacifica inhabits sub- 
arctic water in the rest of the Pacific. 

The type material of P. pacifica consisted of 7 specimens, 3 females 
and 4 males, taken at the surface at Challenger station 240 (32°20 / N., 
153°39 / E.). Stebbing's description was based on a male which seems 
not to be extant, for I am informed by Dr. Isabella Gordon (in litt.) 
that the collections of the British Museum (Natural History) contain 
3 females and 3 males but no dissected male. Through her kindness 
I have been able to examine a male and a female with ova from the 
Challenger material. The female, 6.7 mm. in length, has fully devel- 
oped oostegites and subequal antennae 1 and 2. The male, measur- 
ing 6.5 mm., is not fully mature, for the antennae are only slightly 
longer than the height of the head. Since Stebbing did not select a 
holotype, the Challenger specimens are all syntypes. The above ma- 
ture female is herewith designated as the lectotype of P. pacifica. 

Color: Eyes red, with black centers. General body color purplish 
red due to rather large, dark-red chromatophores, which are visible 
through the transparent cuticle. The chromatophores are most abun- 
dant on the pereon, and make it quite dark. Food in the gut may 
add to the darkness of the pereon. On the pleon the chromatophores 
occur slightly less than halfway down the sides of the pleonites and 
on the middle of the dorsal surface of the third and sometimes also 
the second pleonite. One or two chromatophores are located on the 
dorsal surface of the peduncle of uropod 3. The mouthparts have a 
reddish appearance. Pl-2 have a few chromatophores, and P3-4 may 
have chromatophores at the distal end of the basipods. P5-7 are 
without chromatophores. 

Distribution: The distribution of P. pacifica will be considered in 
three sections: (1) in the area surveyed by CCOFI, off the coasts of 
California and Baja California; (2) in the northwestern Pacific Ocean 
adjacent to Japan and the Kurile Islands; (3) in the north Pacific 
Ocean as a whole. 

1. CCOFI Area: Figures 4 to 7 show the distribution of P. pacifica 
encountered during four CCOFI cruises. At the stations shown, ob- 
lique hauls of 20 minutes duration were made with one-meter plankton 
nets from a depth of about 70 m. (140 m. in cruise 20 except for the 
northernmost line of stations) to the surface. Details of net construc- 
tion and methods by which the hauls were made are given by Ahlstrom 
(1948, 1952). The volume of water strained during a haul was meas-

ured with an Atlas-type current meter fastened in the center of the 
mouth of the net. This measure has been used to correct the counts 
of the numbers of amphipods in the samples studied to numbers per 
1 ,000 cubic m. of water. 

In the CCOFI area P. pacifica is by far the most abundant amphi- 
pod. The southern extent of its range lies within the CCOFI area, 
and by comparing the southern boundaries with the superimposed 
isotherms at a depth of 30 m., it is possible to estimate the limiting 
temperatures. In cruise 1 this temperature is estimated to be about

15° C, and for cruises 5 and 9 about 17°. The data of cruise 20 are 
very limited, but here the 18° isotherm may be limiting. 

The numbers found at the different stations of a cruise vary con- 
siderably. Near the southern limits the numbers decrease somewhat, 
but elsewhere the variation appears to be random and not related to 
available measurements of oceanographic conditions. An unsuccess- 
ful attempt was made to determine the causes behind this variation 
in numbers in cruise 5. Using the northern four lines of stations in 
order to eliminate the limiting effect of higher temperatures to the

south, it was not possible to find any relation between the numbers 
taken at a station and the temperature, salinity, depth of haul, depth 
of thermocline, or the percent of the haul which was made below the 
thermocline. 

The seasonal variation in numbers is of considerable interest. The 
average number per 1,000 cubic m. at the positive stations in 1949 
increased from 165 in March to 445 in July, and then decreased to 
only 67 in November. Fart of the March-July increase may be at-

tributed to the fact that in March the four northernmost lines of sta- 
tions were not occupied, and the average number is more heavily 
affected by the small numbers in the southernmost lines. But even 
if we consider only lines 5-8 of cruise 1, the mean number per station 
is increased only to 229, which still falls far short of the mean number 
for July, 445, or the mean number for lines 5-8 in July, 404. In No- 
vember not only is there a notable decrease in numbers, but the range 
is slightly more restricted because of the higher temperatures of off- 
shore waters. 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 355 

Part of the variation in numbers may be caused by seasonal changes 
in the intensity of breeding. However, females with ova or embryos 
in the brood pouch were abundant at all but the southernmost sta- 
tions on all three cruises. Juveniles which had recently left the brood 
pouch were also widespread, and it is apparent that breeding goes on 
during most if not all of the year. 

Another possible explanation for the seasonal change in catch is 
that the population inhabited deeper water in March and November 
than in July. Some evidence for this is found in a comparison of day 
and night hauls. In both March and November the mean number per 
positive haul was much greater for the night hauls than for the day 
hauls, nearly five times as great in March and more than three times 
as great in November. These differences suggest that diurnal vertical 
movements were occurring during these months, and that during the 
day part of the population was below the level of the net hauls. In 
July, however, there was almost no difference between the mean num- 
ber per station for the day hauls and that for the night hauls. Here 
diurnal vertical migrations were very limited or lacking, and probably 
at least most of the populations were living at depths not greater than 
70 meters. 

2. Northwestern Pacific: I have been able to examine a limited 
number of plankton samples from the northwestern Pacific. In addi- 
tion to Albatross samples, principally from the Sea of Japan, I have 
studied specimens from Carnegie stations, material sent to me by 
Motoda, Nakai, and Yang, and a few specimens from salmon stomachs 
forwarded to me by William Aaron of the University of Washington. 

All the samples from the Japan and Okhotsk Seas contained P. 
japonica. In addition P. japonica was found at Albatross stations 
4805 (east of Iturup Island, Kuriles) and 4806 (east of Cape Yerimo, 
Hokkaido), and in one of Motoda's samples from east of Cape Esan, 
Hokkaido. In these latter three samples P. pacifica also occurred, 
but in much smaller numbers than P. japonica. 

Further east only P. pacifica occurs. Detailed planktonic surveys 
are needed to establish the eastern boundary of P. japonica. P. paci- 
fica extends to Japanese coastal waters, but does not occur in the Japan 
Sea and probably not in the Sea of Okhotsk, where it is replaced by the 
larger P. japonica. 

In 1948 Irio reported on the distribution of a number of pelagic 
amphipods in waters adjacent to Japan, including a species of Para- 
themisto which was listed as "Parathemisto sp. A." In a later paper 
(1957b) this species is illustrated under the name Themisto gracilipes 
Norman, but the illustrations are clearly of Parathemisto japonica. 
Probably both P. japonica and P. pacifica were present in Irie's col- 
lections, and possibly P. gracilipes in the stations south of Japan. 



356 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

In figure 8 I have plotted the distribution of Parathemisto in the 
vicinity of Japan from Irie's data. To these data I have added some 
Albatross and Carnegie stations as well as the localities reported by 
Nakai (1955). While the occurrences in the Japan and Okhotsk Seas 
are undoubtedly P. japonica, those east of Japan probably include both 
P. japonica and P. pacifica. Since the temperatures limiting south- 
ward penetration are similar for P . japonica in the Japan Sea (see p. 366) 
and for P. pacifica along the California coast, Irie's data on the occur- 
rence of Parathemisto east of Japan can be applied to both P. japonica 
and P. pacifica. His data show that these species are most abundant 
north of Japan. Irie (1948) states that Parathemisto is abundant 
between 40° and 50° N., common between 35° and 40° N., but very 
rare between 25° and 35° N. Figure 8 indicates that the southern 
boundary falls at about 36° N. 

P. pacifica inhabits cold water, and the extent of its southern pene- 
tration along the eastern coast of Japan must depend on the relative 
influences of the Kuroshio and the Oyashio. The warm Kuroshio 
leaves the coast of Japan and turns east or northeast at Cape Inubozaki 
(35°40' N.), with a variable amount of north-south meandering 
(Masuzawa, 1955). Koizumi (1953) reported on the temperature 
variations at 39° N., 153° E., a locality which is sometimes covered 
with water of Kuroshio origin, at other times with cold water of Oya- 
shio origin. Here the temperature at a depth of 25 m. in 1948 varied 
from 10.80° C. in March to 21.64° C. in September. Clearly the 
southern boundary of the Oyashio and of its inhabitants, including 
P. japonica and P. pacifica, is subject to fluctuation. 

In the region where the two current systems meet, the Oyashio may 
underlie the Kuroshio to a limited extent. Tanaka (1953) observed 
that in the waters near the Izu Peninsula the warm-water copepod 
species of the Kuroshio were confined to the upper 200 m., while the 
cold-water species of the Oyashio were obtained chiefly from below 
200 m. 

Recently several Russian biologists of plankton have set up faunal 
zones and zoogeographic boundaries in the region east of Japan and 
southeast of the Kurile Islands. This work is summarized by Beklem- 
ishev and Semina (1956) and by Bogorov (1958). P. japonica (=P. 
japonica + P. pacifica) is listed by Bogorov and Vinogradov (1955) 
as an inhabitant of their boreal epipelagic zone, extending south to 
about 40-42° N. and having surface temperatures of from 9-15° C. 
This zone is also characterized by the copepods Calanus tonsus and the 
chaetognaths Sagitta elegans and Eukrohnia hamata. Brodsky (1955a) 
refers to it as the "Calanus tonsus Zone," and it undoubtedly corre- 
sponds to Hida's (1957) "Subarctic Zone" in the mid-Pacific.

Carnegie stations. 

3. North Pacific Ocean: In figure 9 I have attempted to show the 
probable limits of distribution of P. 'pacifica across the entire North 
Pacific. The approximate southern boundary east of about 160° W. 
is based not only on CCOFI material, but also on samples from cruise 
VII of the Carnegie and the Northern Holiday Expedition of the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography. In the region between 170° E. and 
160° W., no collections have been made available to me, but exten- 
sions of the boundaries in the CCOFI area and in the northwestern

imate southern limit of distribution shown by hachured line. 



Pacific gives us a boundary line in the north central Pacific between 
latitudes 42° and 43° N. On the basis of an analysis of the distribu- 
tion of chaetognaths and pteropods in about the same region (22°-50° 
N., 170° E.-145° W.), Hida (1957) established the Subarctic Zone, 
the southern limit of which was defined by the occurrence in abun- 
dance of the chaetognaths Sagitta elegans and Eukrohnia hamata. 
Hida found this boundary to lie between 43° and 45° N.; this finding 
agrees reasonably well with my suggested boundary for Parathemisto 
pacifica. It has already been mentioned that Bogorov and Vino- 
gradov (1955) cited P. japonica as well as the above-mentioned 
chaetognaths as characteristic species of a faunal zone corresponding 
to Hida's Subarctic Zone. In Brodsky's (1955b) scheme for dividing 
the north Pacific into zoogeographical provinces according to the 
copepod faunas, P. pacifica fits roughly into his epipelagic temperate 
province. However, P. pacifica extends somewhat farther south and 
not so far to the north, for Brodsky's temperate province includes the 
southern part of the Chukchi Sea. 

The northern limits of the area inhabitated by P. pacifica are not 
known in detail. The species has not been reported from the Arctic 
Ocean, and I have not found it in any of the plankton samples which 
I have examined from the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Three investi- 
gators have reported it from the Bering Sea as P. japonica (Behning, 
1939; Bulycheva, 1955, Vinogradov, 1956). Further collections in the 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 359 

Bering Sea are needed to determine its northern boundary. The 
investigations of Johnson (1934, 1953, 1956) and Stepanova (1937) 
show that certain zooplanktonic species characteristic of the Bering 
Sea and north Pacific Ocean may be carried into the Chukchi Sea by 
the northward drift through the Bering Strait. P. pacifica does not 
seem to undergo such transport. 

The boundaries of the area inhabited by P. pacifica, described 
above and shown in figure 9, are in fairly close agreement with the 
boundaries of north Pacific Subarctic Water as described and illus- 
trated by Sverdrup et al (1946, p. 712, figures 202, 209a). It is 
apparent that P. pacifica, like Sagitta elegans and Eukrohnia hamata, 
is hy virtue of its temperature requirements an inhabitant of sub- 
Arctic Water, and like these chaetognaths can serve as a biological 
indicator of this cold water of low salinity. However, its distribution 
differs from that Sagitta elegans, recently charted by Bieri (1959), in 
that it penetrates farther to the south and does not enter the Arctic 
Ocean, where S. elegans is common. The euphausiid, Euphausia 
pacifica Hansen, judging from the details given by Boden, Johnson, 
and Brinton (1955), has a distribution more nearly like that of P. 
pacifica than does S. elegans. 

Temperature and body size: It is well known that the size of 
marine poikilotherms is related to the temperature of the water in 
which they develop (Sverdrup et al., 1946, pp. 855-857; Marshall and 
Orr, 1955, pp. 81-89). This relationship has been investigated for 
P. pacifica, and is summarized in figure 10. The mean length of the 
adult females was determined for each station and plotted against 
the temperature at a depth of 30 meters. 

The results show a slight trend toward greater size at lower tem- 
peratures. Coefficients of correlation for cruises 1, 5, and 9 are 
respectively —0.526, —0.571 and —0.582. For the numbers of pairs 
of observations, 14, 20, and 19, the values of r required at the 5 
percent level of significance are 0.532, 0.444, and 0.456. On this 
basis the correlation between Parathemisto body length and 30-meter 
temperature is significant for cruises 5 and 9, and nearly significant 
for cruise 1. 

It can be seen from figure 10 that in July (cruise 5) Parathemisto 
averaged somewhat larger than in March or November. The mean 
length of adult female Parathemisto from all stations of a cruise was 
5.07 mm. in March, 6.22 mm. in July, and 5.25 mm. in November. 
Several explanations are possible for this seasonable variation in 
length : 

1. The Parathemisto populations sampled during the three cruises 
may belong to successive generations, the July generation having 
developed under conditions which resulted in greater size at maturity 

540580—60 2

than the March or November generations. If this explanation is 
correct, it means that several generations are produced each year, 
with each generation living only a few months or less. In contrast, 
Dunbar (1957) proposes a life cycle of 18 months to 2 years for P. 
libellula in the eastern Canadian Arctic, and Bogorov (1940) gives evi- 
dence for a 2-year life cycle for P. abyssorum in the Barents Sea.

ture at a depth of 30 meters. Plus signs, cruise 1, March 1949; circles, cruise 5, July,

ol the adult females from one station. 



However, there is considerable evidence, much of it summarized by 
Dunbar, that marine poikilotherms from warm water grow to maturity 
more rapidly than do those from cold water. It is reasonable to 
suppose that P. pacifica passes through its life cycle more quickly 
than its Arctic relatives. 

2. The Parathemisto population sampled in July may be older, 
hence larger individuals of the generation sampled in March. The 
November population, composed of smaller individuals than the July 
population, must represent a different generation. This interpretation 
requires that an individual breed more than once during its lifetime. 
Dunbar concluded that P. libellula breeds only once and then dies, but 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 361 

this finding is not necessarily true for P. pacifica. On the contrary, 
examination of the ovaries of females with eggs or young in the brood 
pouch provides strong evidence that more than one generation of 
offspring is produced by the individual female. The ovaries can be 
readily seen through the transparent ventral body wall of the pereon; 
they lie on either side of the posterior midgut and anterior hindgut, 
above and in close association with the digestive diverticulae. In 
the ovigerous females that I examined, I saw new groups of eggs 
developing in the ovaries. The presence of a second group of eggs 
indicated that another clutch of eggs would be laid. 

The above evidence indicates that the individual P. pacifica, in con- 
trast to P. libelluia, produces at least two and perhaps more sets of 
offspring during its lifetime. It is therefore possible that the July- 
breeding females are the older and larger members of the generation 
sampled in March, and that they have already produced one or 
more litters. 

3. Because of a seasonal difference in vertical distribution, larger 
specimens, which lived in deeper water in March, were within the 
range of the nets in July. Earlier in this paper it was deduced from 
a comparison of da}* and night hauls that the Parathemisto population 
lives nearer the surface in July than in March or September. This 
habit would account for the larger average length as well as the larger 
numbers of the specimens collected in July. It is well established 
that in most, but not all zooplankters, the adults live at greater depths 
than the juveniles, and adults from deeper water average larger than 
those nearer the surface. Bogorov (1940) found that the young of P. 
abytssorum in the Barents Sea prefer the upper water layers, but accord- 
ing to Dunbar (1946), P. libelluia has a marked phototropism and sta3 T s 
near the surface, especially on sunny days. In the Gulf of Maine the 
young P. gaudichaudii are most numerous near the surface, while 
adults occur mainly in net hauls made below the surface (Bigelow, 
1926, p. 163). 

4. The larger individuals collected in July lived in colder waters 
to the north in March and were carried south by the California 
Current. This hypothesis would not account for the smaller size of 
the November specimens, which would have to belong to a different 
generation. The California Current is slow and meandering, and has 
numerous eddies. It seems unlikely that any considerable segment 
of the Parathemisto population that inhabits the California Current 
is unable to maintain itself latitudinally against the southward flow. 
I regard this explanation as highly improbable. 

It is improbable that any of the above explanations can, by itself, 
fully account for the observed seasonal variation in size of P. pacifica. 
The cruises from which I have studied material are too widely sepa-

rated in time to provide the details needed for a satisfactory 
explanation. 

Development: As in almost all amphipods, the eggs and early 
juveniles are carried loosely in the marsupium between the ventral 
wall of the pereon and the oostegites. Counts made of the number of 
eggs ranged from 20 to 60, with an average number of about 35. 
Behning (1939) found up to 200 eggs per female in the much larger 
(8.5-17 mm.) P. japonica. 

When the young leave the marsupium there is almost no difference 
between the sexes. The young are miniature editions of the adults, 
except that there are fewer setae on the pereopods, and the flagella 
of antennae 1 and 2 are unisegmental in both sexes. Of course the 
oostegites are entirely absent from the female. 

Even at this early stage it is possible to distinguish males from 
females in almost all cases by the shapes of the antennal flagellae, 
especially those of antennae 1. In the early juvenile male the 
flagellum of antenna 1 is longer and broader; the portion distal to the 
sensory filaments, which in the female is shorter and sharply pointed, 
tapers more gradually and is half the length of the whole flagellum. 
The flagellum of antenna 2 is also longer and heavier in the male. 

As development proceeds, the male flagellum becomes segmented. 
In males about to molt, the segmentation which the flagellum will 
have during the following instar can be seen through the cuticle. 
Consequently it has been possible to estimate the number of instars 
from the last stage characterized by a unisegmental flagellum to the 
adult male stage. 

The instars may be defined as follows : 

1. Flagellum of antenna 1 short, unisegmental. 

2. Flagellum slightly shorter than height of head, 8-10 segmented. 

3. Flagellum about as long as pereonites 1-5 combined, 11-12 

segmented. 

4. Adult male, flagellum about as long as pereon, 13-15 segmented. 

The additional segments are added from the distal end of the long 
first flagellar segment. In the male about to molt, it can be seen that 
two or three segments are formed here. The segments distal to the 
first one apparently do not divide further after being formed. 

This method of forming additional segments differs from that of the 
gammarids Pontoporeia affinis Lindstrom (Segerstrale, 1937) and 
Oammarus chevreuxi Sexton (Sexton, 1924). In Pontoporeia males, 
new segments are formed, as in Parathemisto, by division of the 
proximal segment. At first this is the only method, but later the 
remaining segments begin to divide into two, after which the} 7- do not 
divide again. In the female the distal segments do not divide, and 
the process is essentially similar to that in Parathemisto. In 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO — BOWMAN 363 

Gammarus new segments are formed by division of the two (or three 
in older animals) proximal flagellar segments with the result that two 
(or three) new segments are added at each molt. Segerstrale found 
that the antennal segments of the male Pontoporeia become greatly 
lengthened at the last molt; lengthening at this time must also occur 
in Parathemisto (compare figs. 2a and 3a). 

It is apparent that after an unknown number of instars during 
which the antennal flagellum remains unisegmental, the male Para- 
themisto passes through a minimum of three additional instars. 
According to Mogk (1926), the male Phronima sedentaria (Forskal) 
passes through five instars with an unsegmented flagellum. Segments 
first appear in the sixth instar, and the male reaches maturity in the 
seventh instar. In Phronima atlantica Guerin segmentation is also 
first apparent in the sixth instar, but the adult condition is not reached 
until the eighth instar. 

In the first stage after leaving the marsupium, the flagellum of 
antenna 1 of Gammarus chevreuxi Sexton (Sexton, 1924), G. fasciatus 
Say (Clemens, 1950), and Pontoporeia affinis Lindstrom (Segerstrale, 
1937) consists of four segments. By the fourth stage the segments 
number 8 for G. chevreuxi and 9 for G. fasciatus; and in the fifth post- 
marsupial instar there are 10 and 9 segments, respectively. On the 
assumption that the first instar of P. pacijica with segmented flagella 
corresponds to the fourth or fifth instar of Gammarus, we can postulate 
that there are 3 or 4 postmarsupial instars of Parathemisto with 
unsegmented flagellae, or a total of 5 to 6 postmarsupial molts required 
to attain sexual maturit}*. In gammarideans which have been 
studied, from 7-14 molts are required (Sexton, 1924, 1928; Roux, 
1933; Clemens, 1950; Kinne, 1953, 1959). 

Oostegites first appear in the female when she is quitesmall (3.1 mm. in 
the earliest stage illustrated). At this stage, the oostegites are very 
small lobes arising mediad to the gills and only about one-third the 
length of the gills. During subsequent molts the oostegites increase in 
size, and in the adult they are transparent, membranous and much 
larger than the gills. No marginal setae are present. Development 
of the oostegites in P. libellula is identical (Dunbar, 1957). 

The size at which maturity is reached varies widely. As an example, 
382 females and 491 males from station 702, cruise 1, were examined 
for maturity, judged in the males by the elongate antennae and in the 
females by the presence of fully developed oostegites. The results are 
given in table 1 . 

The males attain maturity at a slightly smaller size than the females, 
though not necessarily at a younger age. 

Food: Reports of the food habits of P. gavdichavdii and P. libellula 
have been given by Bigelow (1926, p. 107) and Dunbar (1946) respec-

tively. Both species are predominately carnivorous, sometimes can- 
nibalistic, but also ingest some vegetable matter. 

I have examined the midgut contents of a few specimens of P. pacijica. 
Consisting of minute greenish or brownish particles, much of the ma- 
terial was unrecognizable, but some fragments of diatoms and crusta- 
ceans were identified. The crustacean parts included copepod swim- 
ming legs and mouthparts (one mandible was recognizable), spines of 
undetermined origin, and crystalline cones from compound eyes. It 
seems reasonable to conclude that the food habits of P. pacijica are 
similar to those of P. gaudichaudii and P. libellula. 

Anatomy of digestive tract: The structure of the alimentary 
canal of P. libellula is considered briefly by Dunbar (1946). He de- 
scribes an interesting "gastric apparatus" formed of dorsolateral and 
ventral sheets projecting backward in the midgut, which he compares 
with the peritrophic membrane of insects and onychophorans. Dun- 
bar also states that there are no caeca or diverticula of any kind. On 
this point my findings do not agree with his. 

In P. pacijica a pair of caecae arise laterally from the midgut near 
its anterior end. They extend posteriorly along the entire length of 
the pereon and run along in close association with the lateral parts of 
the midgut and with the gonads which lie dorsal to them. The caecae 
usually have a coarsely vesicular appearance; in section the vesicles 
are seen to be large vacuolate cells. The vacuoles are filled with an oily 
or fatty material, and vary greatly in size. In some individuals the vac- 
uolate cells are so large that the lumena of the caecae are nearly obliter- 
ated; in others the vacuoles are small and the lumena well defined. 

Contrary to Dunbar's statement, a pair of caecae is also present in 
P. libellula. Because they are closely applied to and partially fused 
with the gut wall, their true nature is not obvious in dissected speci- 
mens, and if the lumen is sufficiently encroached on by the large 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO — BOWMAN 365 

vacuolate cells, it may be difficult to interpret the caecae correctly in 
sectioned material. I have also found the same caecae in P. gaudi- 
chaudii from the Gulf of Maine, and they are probably characteristic 
of all species of Parathemisto. 

Although I have not made a detailed study of the histologj" of the 
digestive caecae, it seems reasonable to suppose that their principal 
function is the storage of reserve food supplies. The large fat cells 
can scarcely be interpreted otherwise. In some specimens of P. gaudi- 
chaudii which had been stored in alcohol for a long period, the caecae 
have the appearance of a foamy network, and must be made up almost 
completely of fat cells. I have found no structure in Parathemisto 
comparable to the fat body of gammarids, and the storage of reserve 
food in this genus is probably carried out by the digestive diverticula. 
It is interesting to note that Xakai (1955) found the crude fat content 
of P. japonica from Korean waters to be nearly 40 percent of the dry 
weight.

Diagnosis: Total length of adult 9, excluding antennae, 9-17 mm. 
Identical with P. pacijica in almost all characters except size, but 
female antenna 2 much longer than antenna 1, slightly longer than 
head plus first 3 pereonites. Setae of pereopods more conspicuous, 
more numerous on gnathopods. 

Remarks: While I am not unalterably convinced that P. japonica 
and P. pacijica are distinct species, all the evidence at my disposal 
leads to this conclusion. Except for mutilated specimens, I have 
had almost no difficulty in assigning specimens to one or the other 
species. The geographic ranges are different, with some overlap east 
of northern Japan and the southern Kuriles. In the three samples 
where both species occurred, I have found no intergrades, and thus no 
evidence of interbreeding. 

Since the number of pereopodal setae increases with age in some 
species of hyperiids (unpublished observation), it may be argued that 
P. japonica is an older and larger form of P. pacijica. However, it is 
possible to distinguish the young stages of the two species. Antenna 
2 is longer than antenna 1 even in very young specimens of P. 
japonica. The difference in the development of setae on pereopod 6, 



366 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

especially on the posterior margin of the propodus, is shown in figure 
2j of a 7.0 mm. adult female P. pacijica and figure 2e of a 6.7 mm. 
juvenile P. japonicus, both of which were taken in the same net tow off 
Cape Esan, Hokkaido, Japan. 

The correlation between temperature and body length in P. pacijica 
raises the possibility that the large size of P. japonica is attributable to 
the low temperatures at which it lives. P. pacijica is abundant in 
the Gulf of Alaska, where adult females commonly measure 6.0-7.0 
mm. in length. This size is much smaller than the size of P. japonica, 
and yet surface temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska are similar to those 
in the colder parts of the Sea of Japan (compare Kobinson, 1957, 
fig. 18, and Uda, 1934, figs. 5 and 9). 

With this evidence, the best course is to treat P. japonica and P. 
pacijica as closely related, but distinct, species. If intensive collec- 
tions from the region of overlapping distributions should reveal exten- 
sive intergradation, it would then be necessary to reduce their status 
to that of subspecies. In the limited number of samples at my 
disposal, however, there is no indication of such intergradation. 

The Japanese zoologist Zinziro Nakai believes that the hyperiid 
which I have described as P. japonica Bovallius is an undescribed 
species of Parathemisto. He has assigned to it the Japanese name 
"Usumurasaki-uminomi" (light purple sea flea) and intends to describe 
it as a new species (Nakai, 1955). Nakai states (in litt., Oct. 23, 1954) 
that his decision is based on many discrepancies between Bovallius' 
descriptions and the structure of specimens from Japanese waters, and 
on Bovallius' statement (1889) that P. japonica occurs in the sub- 
tropical region as well as in the northern temperate region of the Pacific. 
Nakai believes that P. japonica is distributed south of Japan and has 
not been discovered since Bovallius' description of 1889, while "usumu- 
rasaki-uminomi" is the common species found north of Japan. 

In my opinion, Nakai places too much confidence in the detailed 
accuracy of Bovallius' descriptions and illustrations. I believe the 
differences that Nakai finds between Bovallius' account of P. japonica 
and "usumurasaki-uminomi" can be explained as inaccuracies of 
Bovallius or as variations in the structure of P. japonica. 

Distribution: Okhotsk Sea, Sea of Japan, western north Pacific 
off the east coasts of northern Japan and the southern Kuriles. 

East of Japan and the southern Kuriles, P. japonica, like P. pacijica, 
inhabits Subarctic Water and penetrates about as far south along the 
Japanese coast as the cold Oyashio. The extent of its eastward 
distribution is unknown, but at some distance it is replaced by P. 
pacijica. 

In the Sea of Japan the scattered records from Albatross stations 
show that P. japonica extends south nearly to the Straits of Korea. 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 367 

The findings of Yamada (1933) are more instructive. In his report on 
plankton collected from a series of stations off both coasts of Korea, he 
found P. japonica present off the east coast south to nearly 38°, but 
absent from the Tusima Straits and the Yellow Sea. This distribution 
correlates well with the hydrography of the Sea of Japan. As Uda 
(1934) has shown, the water on the Asiatic mainland side is much 
colder than that on the Japanese side. The cold water flows south 
along the mainland coast (Liman Current) to the latitude of about 
36°-38° N. and forms several counterclockwise eddies as it flows. Only 
a small amount of mixing occurs between this cold water, presumably 
formed by excessive cooling in winter, and the warm, north-flowing 
water of the Tusima Current, a branch of the Kuroshio. 

Yamada's findings suggest that P. japonica is distributed in the Sea 
of Japan according to the extent of the cold water, as Tokioka (1940) 
found for the chaetognath, Sagitta elegans. The occurrence of P. 
japonica at Albatross stations along the west coast of Honshu makes 
this hypothesis improbable. Uda's (1934) isotherm charts show that 
in June most of the Sea of Japan is characterized by temperatures at 
least as low as those of the southern boundary of the Ctyashio. The 
Oyashio boundary temperatures in Uda's charts are 17°-19° C. at the 
surface and at 25 m., about 17° at 50 m., and about 15° at 100 m. 
Most of the water of the Sea of Japan at these depths is as cold or 
colder, while the water of the southward-flowing current in the west is 
considerably colder. Hence a wide distribution of P. japonica in the 
Sea of Japan is to be expected from our knowledge of its distribution 
off the east coast of Japan. 

It is reasonable to believe that P. japonica evolved from P. pacifica 
or from a common ancestor of both species as a result of geographical 
isolation. The current patterns in the Japan Sea provide little oppor- 
tunity for P. pacifica to enter from the Pacific Ocean. Almost all the 
water entering the Sea of Japan is warm water derived from the Kuro- 
shio; only a very small quantit}' of cold water enters through Tartary 
Strait between the Asiatic coast and Sakhalin Island. Water leaves 
the Japan Sea by way of the Straits of Soya (La Perouse) and Tsugaru, 
north and south of Hokkaido, respectively. Information concerning 
water movements in the Okhotsk Sea is still scanty. According to 
Brims (1958) there is some exchange of water with the Pacific Ocean 
through the Kuriles. The very limited collections available to me 
indicate that this exchange of water has been insufficient to allow P. 
pacifica to become established in the Okhotsk Sea. 

Actually, therefore, the P. japonica population in the Okhotsk Sea 
and especially in the Sea of Japan is effectively isolated from extensive 
gene flow from the P. pacifica population. The three northwestern 
Pacific occurrences of P. japonica reported in this paper may be ex- 



368 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

plained as being derived from the Japan or Okhotsk Seas. For some 
as yet unknown reason, P. japonica has not been able to extend its 
range far beyond the immediate vicinity of its site of origin.

Diagnosis: Length of adult 10-21 mm. Larger and more slender 
than P. pacijica, and head more roundly produced. Maxilliped with- 
out a distal row of setae on the basal plate. Pi -4 with more surface 
setae than in P. pacijica; posterior margin of propodus of Pi serrate 
and bearing several long setae. Carpal process of P2 with long end 
spine. In length P5>P7>P6; no long spines at posterior distal 
corners of carpi; dactyls not pectinate. Peduncle of uropod 3 about 
3 times as long as telson. 

Distribution: Ekman (1953, p. 340) mentions P. abyssorum as 
an example of an "arctic-bathy-subarctic" species. In this category 
he includes plankters which live primarily in Arctic waters, but are 
also found in deep water in lower latitudes. A detailed discussion of 
the distribution of P. abyssorum in the Atlantic is given by Stephensen 
(1923, pp. 22-24, chart 4). Found throughout the Arctic and Sub- 
Arctic Atlantic, it is very common in the vicinity of Greenland 
and between Norway and Iceland. Stephensen believes that 
Bonnier 's (1896) record of 9 mm. ovigerous P. oblivia taken at a depth 
of 950 m. in the Bay of Biscay should be referred to this species. On 
the western side of the Atlantic it occurs occasionally in the Gulf of 
Maine (Bigelow, 1926) and is widely distributed in and around the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence (Shoemaker, 1930; Bousfield, 1951). Bousfield 
believes that the permanent deep layer of very cold water in the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence enables the species to breed there successfully, as 
evidenced by the large numbers of young and immature stages taken 
near the surface. 

I have not found P. abyssorum in any plankton collections from the 
Pacific Ocean. It was, however, the most commonly collected amphi- 
pod during the 1950 and 1951 expeditions of the Burton Island to the 
Beaufort Sea and in the 1953 expedition to Amundsen Gulf and Prince 
of Wales Strait. Station positions and locality records for P. abys- 
sorum are shown in figure 12. Plankton hauls were made vertically 
with a one-half-meter Nansen type plankton net. In 1950 the hauls 
were made from various depths, usually 100-0 m., and in 1951 all

hauls were 100-0 m. except where the depth of the water was less 
than 100 m. In 1953 hauls were made from the bottom (usually less 
than 100 m.) to the surface. 

In both 1950 and 1951 P. abyssorum occurred at about half the sta- 
tions occupied and in about the same numbers. The average number 
per station (adjusted to 100 m. vertical tow) was 2.3 in 1950 and 2.6 
in 1951 . Distribution in the Beaufort Sea appeared not to be associated 
with variations in temperature or salinity. 

P. abyssorum was somewhat less numerous in the 1953 Burton Island 
samples, and was captured at only 4 of the 25 stations in the Prince of

Wales Strait. The average number per station was 0.75; the average 
number per positive station, 1.50. 

All the specimens of P. abyssorum collected on the Burton Island 
cruises were juvenile, with the exception of one ovigerous female, 
14 mm. in length, taken at station 3, off Cape Parry, hi a tow from 
420 m. to the surface, August 8, 1953. 

Little is known about the life history of P. abyssorum. Bogorov 
(1940) studied the life cycle in the Barents Sea and concluded that 
spawning occurs in "the second half of the winter season (about Febru- 
ary)." He further concluded that the individual requires 2 years 
to grow to maturity, breeds once, and dies. The breeding season 
appears to be more prolonged than indicated by Bogorov, since at 
least some breeding occurs in the Beaufort Sea in August (see above), 
and Stephensen (1933) reported ovigerous females taken June 12 and 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 371 

July 14 in waters west of Greenland. In the collections of the U.S. 
National Museum is a lot consisting of three adult males, 13, 14, and 
14.5 mm. in length, and a female 14.8 mm., with fully developed ooste- 
gites, taken on May 18, 1902, between the Shetland and Faroe Islands. 

Several records of P. abyssorum or P. oblivia in the Pacific Ocean 
are probably erroneous, since the authors almost certainly had P. 
pacifica or P. japonica. These include the records of Shoemaker 
(1930) and Thorsteinson (1941) from near Nanaimo, British Columbia, 
and that of Holmes (1904) from Humboldt Bay, Popof Island, Alaska 
(about 55° N., 161° W.). Possibly the specimens of "P. oblivia" 
from stations 13 and 14 of the Canadian Arctic Expedition (Shoe- 
maker, 1920) were P. japonica, and those from stations 21 and 27 
were P. abyssorum. Irie's (1957a) record from the Tusima Straits 
is probably P. japonica. 

The puzzling thing about the distribution of P. abyssorum is that 
it has not been able to establish itself in the Pacific (fig. 13). This 
absence cannot be simply a matter of temperature, since the Okhotsk 
Sea and the western Bering Sea are regions of very low temperatures. 
In fact P. libellula, an Arctic species which does not penetrate as far 
to the south in the Atlantic as P. abyssorum, occurs in the Bering and 
Okhotsk Seas. 

Three possible explanations may be given for the absence of P. 
abyssorum from the Pacific: 

1 . The current flow through the Bering Strait has made it mechani- 
cally impossible for P. abyssorum to enter the Pacific Ocean. The 
hydrographic evidence for a northward flow of water from the Bering 
Sea into the Chukchi Sea (Barnes and Thompson, 1938; LaFond and 
Pritchard, 1952) is corroborated by Johnson's (1956) report of the 
presence of characteristic Bering Sea copepods in the Chukchi Sea 
(Eucalanus bungii bungii Johnson, Metridia lucens Boeck). While 
the penetration of Arctic plankters into the Pacific would be retarded 
by this northward current, it is unreasonable to suppose that it 
would be completely inhibited. On the extreme west of Bering 
Strait there appears to be some movement of water southward, and 
Sewell (1948, pp. 399-401) believes that this movement has carried 
certain Arctic planktonic copepods into the north Pacific. 

2. P. abyssorum is unable to compete successfully with the closely 
related north Pacific species, P. japonica and P. pacifica. All three 
species are very similar in structure and probably occupy similar if 
not identical ecologic niches. Possibly the Pacific species evolved 
during a time of isolation of the Pacific from the Arctic by emergence 
of Bering Strait. Bering Strait has been above sea level during much 
of geologic history. Hopkins (1959) has recently reviewed the 
Cenozoic history of the Bering Land Bridge. Evidence of the

interchange of land mammals strongly suggests that the bridge was 
submerged during middle Eocene time (Simpson, 1947a, 1947b), 
although physical evidence in support of this submergence has not yet 
been found in Alaska or the islands of the Bering Sea. During most 
of the remainder of the Tertiary Period the bridge was above sea level. 
After middle Pleiocene time but before the beginning of the Pleisto- 
cene epoch, the bridge was again submerged. The bridge emerged 
during each glacial interval and submerged during each interglacial 
interval of the Pleistocene; it sank below sea level for the last time 
between 11,000 and 12,000 years ago. There has thus been ample 
opportunity for the evolution of species in the north Pacific differing 
from their arctic relatives. If the northward flow of the current in the 
Bering Strait severely limits the numbers of P. abyssorum entering the 
Bering Sea, it is evident that this species would be markedly handi- 
capped in establishing itself in competition with the abundant P. 
pacijica. 

3. P. abyssorum avoids shallow water, hence does not enter the 
shallow Bering Strait. As suggested b}^ the specific name, P. abys- 
sorum, according to Stephensen (1923, p. 23), is found, as a rule, where 
the depth of the sea is considerable, 400-3,127 meters. It occurs in 
shallower water, as in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where Bousfield 
(1951) reports it from stations where the water was less than 100 m. 
deep, though it was rare in the shallow water inside the Belle Isle 
Strait. Curiously, Bousfield found that P. abyssorum was an indica- 
tor of the relatively warm Gulf of St. Lawrence water, rather than, 
as might be expected of an Arctic species, of the cold water of the 
Labrador Current, which (Miters the gulf on the north side of the 
Belle Isle Strait. It is most abundant at the deep water stations of 
the gulf, which do not happen to be in the region influenced by the 
Labrador Current. It probably enters the gulf through ( 1 al>ot Strait, 
rather than through the shallow Belle Isle Strait; this entrance also 
accounts for the larger numbers at the stations in the southern part of 
the gulf. 

The depths of the sea at the stations in the Beaufort and Chukchi 
Seas occupied by the U.S.S. Burton Island ranged from 18 to 4,050 m. 
The depths at which P. abyssorum occurred are summarized in table 2. 

The shallowest station at which P. abyssorum was taken was 53 m. 
The entire Bering Strait is less than 50 m. deep, much of it considerably 
less, and this shallowness may be an important factor in preventing 
P. abyssorum from gaining entrance to the Pacific Ocean. The com- 
parative scarcity of P. abyssorum in the Prince of Wales Strait may be 
related to the shallowness of the water there; the deepest station was 
150 m., and only five stations were more than 100 m.

Probably none of the three explanations given above can by itself 
account for the absence of P. abyssorum from the Pacific Ocean. A 
combination of them may, however, be effective, the shallowness of the 
Bering Strait and the northward set of the currents preventing all but 
a small number from entering the Bering Sea, while competition with 
P. pacifica prevents those that do enter from establishing themselves.

Parathemisto. P5 much longer than P6-7 (except in some females 
of P. (E.) gracilipes). Peduncle of uropod 3 only slightly produced 
at inner distal end.

Hurley (1955) discusses in detail the difficulties in distinguishing 
between australis, gracilipes, and gaudichaudii in collections from New 
Zealand waters. The three species show clear differences in general 
appearances, but these are very difficult to set down in words. Hurley 
notes that P. australis is shorter and stockier than the other species, 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 375 

with no sign of dorsal spines, and with coarse serrations on the inner 
ramus of uropod 3. P. gaudichaudii is characterized by larger size (up 
to 18 mm.), very distinct dorsal spination in adults, and the lack of 
serration along the inner margin of uropod 3 inner ramus aud peduncle. 
In P. gracilipes the peduncle of uropod 3 of the very largest specimens 
appears serrulate when viewed under very high power, but is not at all 
comparable to that of P. australis. The serration of uropod 3 inner 
ramus is poorly developed in the female of P. gracilipes.

Diagnosis: Total length of adult, excluding antennae, 4-7 mm., 
rarely up to 9 mm. (Stephensen, Mediterranean and Atlantic speci- 
mens); 6.5-14 mm. (Hurley, New Zealand specimens); 4.1-5.6 mm. 
(specimens from Tusima Straits and Eastern Sea). Only slight ten- 
dency to dorsal spination. Carpus of P2 extends about two-thirds 
along propodus, has one stout end spine. Uropod 3, inner ramus 
pectinate on both margins; inner margin of peduncle finely toothed 
in male (teeth very inconspicuous or absent in female). 

Remarks: The above diagnosis is based largely on that of Hurley 
(1955, p. 153), who has studied abundant material of P. gracilipes, 
P. gaudichaudii, and P. australis from New Zealand waters. I have had 
at my disposal a limited number of specimens from two surface- 
plankton tows— one made in Tusima Straits (34°20.7' N., 130°47.3' 
E.) and the other in the East China Sea west of Kyusyu, Japan 
(32°06.4' N., 128°57.0' E.), kindly sent to me by Zinziro Nakai. In 
addition, Won Tack Yang sent me three lots from off the southern 
coast of Korea. The characters which Hurley regards as diagnostic 
for P. gracilipes are found in these specimens. The Japanese speci- 
mens are small; two adult females measure 4.8 and 5.4 mm., and 
eight adult males range in length from 4.1-5.6 mm. and average 4.9 
mm. The setal armature of the pereopods resembles Stephensen's 
(1924, figs. 39-41) rather than Hurley's drawings (1955, text-figs. 8-9). 
This fact may be attributed to the larger size of the New Zealand 
specimens. 

In the Japanese specimens the serrulations of the inner margin of 
the male and female uropod 3 peduncle are barely discernible under 
high (X440) magnification, even less evident than that figured by 

O405S0— 60 3

Hurley. This near absence of serrulations is also probably due to the 
small size of the Japanese specimens. As in Hurley's description, the 
inner margin of uropod 3 inner ramus is more finely serrate in the fe- 
male than in the male. In the female P5 and P7 are subequal, slightly 
longer than P6. In the male, P5 is relatively longer; the distal end of 
P6 propodus reaches about three-fourths to the distal end of P5 
propodus. 

The Korean specimens agree in general with the Japanese ones, 
which appear to represent Stephensen's (1924) "short-legged" form, 
but one lot collected west of Mok Po (34°30' N., 125°0' E.), consisting 
of an adult female and a juvenile, agrees with Stephensen's "long- 
legged" form, except in the shape of the carpus of P3-4. In the adult 
female, P6 extends one-fourth the distance down the propodus of P5 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 377 

and has a high comb of setae on its anterior margin. P3-4 carpus 
(fig. 6) arc of the form typical for P. gaudichaudii forma bispinosa 
(=antarctica), in which the carpus is wide proximally and narrows 
distally; the posterior margin is convex in the proximal part and be- 
comes straight or slightly concave distally. A tendency toward (his 
form is evident in the New Zealand specimens illustrated by Hurley 
(1955, text-fig. 9, Nos. 155-156). According to Stephensen, there 
are no fine teeth along the posterior margin between the long setae in 
the female, hut these are present in both the New Zealand and Korean 
specimens. 

Yamada (1933) illustrates a "Parathemisto sp. (12)" which he found 
to be widely distributed in the Yellow Sea. Although he did not 
identify it specifically, he stated that using Barnard's key (1930) the 
specimens keyed out to P. gaudichaudii. This statement implies that 
the inner margin of the inner ramus of uropod 3 appeared smooth to 
him. In my Korean "long-legged" P. gracUipes, the serrations of this 
margin are quite weak, and it is possible that they escaped Yamada's 
notice. If so, his "Parathemisto sp. (12)'' is P. gracUipes rather than 
P. gaudichaudii, for in other respects "Parathemisto sp. (12)" agrees 
reasonably well with my" long-legged" P. gracUipes. Yamada's speci- 
mens attained a length of 7-8 mm.; this length is short for P. gaudi- 
chaudii, but about right for P. gracUipes. Moreover, on the basis of 
the temperatures at which they live in other regions, P. gracUipes, 
rather than P. gaudichaudii, would be expected to occur in the East 
China and Yellow Seas. 

Although it thus seems probable that Yamada's "Parathemisto sp. 
(12)" is P. gracUipes, the possibility remains that his tentative identi- 
fication of it as P. gaudichaudii was correct. This problem cannot be 
solved until extensive collections from the Yellow Sea are available. 

Distribution: Figure 15 shows the known distribution oiP.gracvr 
lipes. It is evident that much remains to be learned about its distri- 
bution, especially in the southern hemisphere. The record of Stewart 
(1913) from off Brazil is probably erroneous, since members of the 
genus Parathemisto are not known to inhabit tropical waters. Steph- 
ensen (1949) regarded his identification of specimens from Tristan da 
Cunha as doubtful. 

The collections of the U.S. National Museum contain 7 specimens 
of P. gracUipes collected in the vicinity of the Juan Fernandez Islands 
by the yacht Vagabondia. Comparable in size to Hurley's New Zea- 
land specimens, these specimens range from 7.9-8.5 mm. in length 
and agree well with Hurley's description. 

P. gracUipes lives in warmer water than P. gaudichaudii. This 
preference is clearly shown in the distribution of the two species in 
the north Atlantic (see figs. 15 and 17; see also Stephensen, 1923 and

1924 and Pirlot, 1939). Bary (1959) showed a similar difference in tem- 
perature preference in southern New Zealand waters. The absence 
of P. gracilipes from the Atlantic coast of the United States results 
from the rapid change of temperature over the range inhabited by 
P. gracilipes so that it literally has no living room. Hurley (1955) 
pointed out that P. gracilipes inhabits more neritic water than P. 
gaudichaudii in the New Zealand area, and Bary's (1959) detailed 
analysis confirms this view. In the north Pacific the occurrence of 
P. gracilipes in the east China and Yellow Seas may reflect its pref- 
erence for coastal waters. Both of these seas are shallow and subject 
to much runoff from rivers. 

In the vicinity of Plymouth, England, P. gracilipes undergoes a 
diurnal vertical migration; it moves close to the surface at night and 
descends during the day (Russell, 1925). Bary's data show evidence 
of a similar migration in New Zealand waters.

Diagnosis (slightly altered from hurley, 1955): Length of 
adult, 7-25 mm. Strong dorsal spines in animals of more than 10 mm. 
total length. Carpus of P2 extends three-fourths along propodus. 
P3 male carpus widest proximally, width nearly one-half the length; 
like P. gracilipes, but rather more spines on surface and margin; 
carpus and propodus subequal. P4 male carpus oblong-ovate, width 
slightly more than one-half the length, fringe of small even bristles 
on posterior margin; about 12 strong spines. Uropod 2 outer ramus 
about three-fifths length of inner. Uropod 3 outer ramus two-thirds 
length of inner; inner ramus with smooth inner margin; inner margin 
of peduncle entirely smooth. P3 female carpus oblong-ovate and 
widest proximally, width about two-thirds the length; numerous fine 
surface spines, 10 marginal spines, marginal bristles throughout. 
P4 female has about 18 surface spines on carpus. 

Remarks: As Hurley has pointed out, the most dependable cri- 
terion by which P. gaudichaudii can be identified is the completely 
smooth inner margins of the peduncle and inner ramus of uropod 3.

Some care must be exercised, since Hurley observed that some female 
P. gracilipes have nearly smooth inner margins on the inner rami of 
uropod 3; these margins are nearly smooth in North Pacific specimens 
also. 

According to Hurley's diagnoses, the carpal process of P. gaudi- 
chaudii P2 has several end spines, while that of P. gracilipes has one 
stout end spine. The carpal processes of these species are shown 
in figures lQa-b, looking down on the concave surface. Each 
has one large, stout spine inserted near the distal end, and a series 
of shorter, more slender spines distributed along the margins. The 
carpal process of the large specimen of P. gaudichaudii has about twice 
as many marginal spines as that of the small P. gracilipes, and the 
process is longer in relation to its breadth. 

I have not seen any specimens of P. gaudichaudii from the North 
Pacific, and it is included in this paper because of the possibility, 
discussed under P. gracilipes, that Yamada's "Parathemisto sp. (12)" 
may belong here. 

Distribution: As shown in figure 17, P. gaudichaudii is widely 
distributed in the cooler part of the north Atlantic with a few scattered 
records from warm water. Records in the southern hemisphere 
are less complete than in the north Atlantic, but it probably occurs 
throughout the Antarctic Ocean; i.e., the area between the Antarctic 
Continent and the Antarctic Convergence (Sverdrup, Johnson, and 
Fleming, 1942).

Diagnosis: The largest species of Parathemisto, reaching a length 
of 60 mm. Body segments not produced into spines dorsally. Fe- 
male antennae 1 and 2 subequal; antenna 1 slender, straight, lower 
margin of flagellum serrate. First segment of mandibular palp 
setiferous. Maxilliped with distal row of long setae on basal plate 
and several long setae on lateral margins of outer plates. Carpal 
process of P2 with short end-spine and rounded lobes behind the 
spines on the lateral margins. P5 much longer than P6; P7 slightly 
shorter than P6; dactyls of P5-7 strongly pectinate at their bases. 
Inner ramus of uropod 3 serrate on both margins; peduncle strongly 
produced at inner distal corner. 



AMPHIPOD GENUS PARATHEMISTO BOWMAN 383 

Remarks: The straight antenna 1 and the produced inner distal 
corner of uropod 3 are characteristic of subgenus Parathemislo, but 
the elongate P5 places P. libellula in subgenus Euthemisto. The 
species is easily recognized by the pectinate dactyls of P5-7. 

Although Mandt has always been cited as the author of this species, 
Mandt expressly states that the name and description were prepared 
by Lichtenstein. The name "libellula" must therefore be attributed 
to Lichtenstein rather than to Mandt. 

Distribution (figures 18, 19): Circumpolar in the Arctic Ocean. 
Its distribution in the eastern part of the north Atlantic is given in 
detail by Stephenscn (1923). He reports it from many localities near 
Greenland and Iceland. In the Norwegian Sea it is not found below 
70° N. In the western North Atlantic the southernmost records are 
from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the east coast of Newfoundland. 
In the Pacific Ocean Behning (1939) records it from the Bering Sea 
and from the Okhotsk Sea as far south as about 46° N. (southeast of 
Sakhalin Island). Bulychcva (1955) also reports it from the Bering 
and Okhotsk Seas. I have identified specimens taken in September 
1958 at four stations in the vicinity of Afognak Island, Alaska, by 
the University of Washington M/V Brown Bear. No other records 
from the Gulf of Alaska are known to me. Vinogradov (1956) sum- 
marizes the known distributional records in his figure 10. 

Aside from P. abyssorum, P. libellula was the only commonly 
collected amphipod in the 1950, 1951, and 1953 expeditions of the 
Burton Island. In 1950 it occurred at about one-third and in 1951 at 
about one-fifth of the stations occupied. The average number per 
station (100 m. vertical tow) was 0.66 in 1950 and 0.30 in 1951. The 
average number per positive station was 2.2 in 1950 and 1.5 in 1951. 
No correlation with variations in temperature or salinity was found. 

P. libellula was taken at 5 of the 25 Burton Island stations in the 
Prince of Wales Strait in 1953. The average number per station was 
1.13; the average number per positive station was 1.80. 

Life history: The life history has been studied in some detail 
by Dunbar (1946, 1957), who points out the importance of P. libellula 
in the ecology of the eastern Canadian Arctic. It is fed on heavily 
by the Arctic char and especially by the ringed seal. Dunbar 
postulates a life cycle of 2 years, with spawning beginning in Sep- 
tember of the second year and extending through the winter until 
some time in May or June. The individual is believed to breed 
once and then to die. If this alternating or 2-phase breeding 
cycle remained undisturbed, adjacent year classes would be repro- 
ductively isolated. There is evidence that a few juveniles of each 
year breed the following winter, so reproductive isolation of the two 
coexisting year classes is not complete.

maturing females are all present, and at Station 3518 (60°22' N., 
171°42' W., August 3, 1893) an ovigerous female, 30 mm. in length, 
was collected. Evidently some breeding takes place during early 
August in the Bering Sea. 

Dunbar's work on the life history of P. libellula and his proposed 
breeding cycle are of considerable interest. Much additional col- 
lecting, especially in the winter months, is needed before the validity 
of his conclusions can be adequately assessed.

ASSASSIN BUGS OF THE GENUS GHILIANELLA 

IN THE AMERICAS 

(IIEMIPTERA, REDUYIIDAE, EMESINAE) 



By J. Maldonado-Capriles 1 



This paper brings together and summarizes available data on the 
genus Ghilianella in the Americas. Descriptions of the genus and 
subgenera are given, as well as a checklist of the 88 known species. 
The keys differentiate the 80 species of which specimens were available 
for study; they are expansions of those published in 1925 by McAtee 
and Malloch (the fine work of these authors has aided me greatly in 
the completion of this paper). Among the species treated in the 
following pages, 15 are described as new, 1 is redescribed, and the 
''hypotypes" of 7 others are described. For 32 previously described 
species, notes are given on specimens examined, and the paper closes 
with notes on the 8 species not included in the keys. In the illustra- 
tions (see pp. 407-421) I have tried to keep together similar structures 
from the various species so that a comparison of them could be made. 

In this paper, the term "hypotype" is used to refer to a specimen 
herein described and belonging to the opposite sex of the corresponding 
holotype described by another author. Additional specimens of the 
hypotype are called "parahypotypes." Thus, I have followed the 
terminology suggested by Frizzell (1933).

Dr. Reece I. Sailer, U.S. Department of Agriculture, especially 
for loaning unidentified material and permitting me to examine the 
type material deposited in the U.S. National Museum (USNM), and 
for his detailed review of the manuscript of this paper. 

Dr. George Wallace, Carnigie Museum (CM) at Pittsburgh, 
Pennyslvania. 

Dr. Petr Wygodzinsky (PW), Instituto de Medicina Regional, 
Universidad Nacional, Tucuman, Argentina, especially for loaning 
me abundant material from his collection and other material under his 
temporary care, especially that from the Vienna Museum (VM). 

Genus Ghilianella Spinola 

Ghilianella Spinola, 1850, p. 102. 

The following descriptions are abstracted from McAtee and Malloch 
(1925): 

Genus Ghilianella Spinola: foretarsi without distinguishable seg- 
mentation under the highest power (even when cleared), consisting 
of but one heavily chitinized segment, with an unequal pair of claws, 
a single claw, or without distinct claws. Foretarsus with two longi- 
tudinal series of angularly deflected spines, which under high power 
appear like elongate knifelike teeth on its ventral surface. Head 
with a more or less pronounced spine or tubercle between bases of 
antenna, labrum closely adherent to base of rostrum, not projecting 
spine-like. Adults never winged. Head and thorax more or less 
granulate, the former with a profound constriction anterior of eyes. 
Mesothorax and metathorax each tricarinate or with a median carina 
and lateral rows of tubercles above and usually unicarinate below. 



GHILIANELLA ASSASSIN BUGS — MALDONADO-CAPRILES 



395 



Abdomen more or less carinate or keeled below. Front tibia with 
a patch of short pale golden hairs on inner side apically and a tuft 
of longer ones at the apex inferiorly. Middle and hind legs and 
antenna much longer than body. When the legs have pale markings, 
they arc almost invariably as follows: middle and hind femora with 
two postmedian bands and a subapical spot, and tibiae with a sub- 
basal spot; in the pale species, dark markings tend to appear at these 
same places; frontal and femoral spines mostly pale. 

Subgenus Ghilianella Spinola, 1850: claws of forctarsi two, the inner 
short, closely applied to the base of outer. 

Subgenus Ploeodonyx McAtee and Malloch, 1925: claw of foretarsus 
single; claw separated from tarsus by a suture; forefemur rather 
slender as a whole, but notably thicker near base than at first strong 
spine. 

Subgenus Lissonyx McAtee and Malloch, 1925: claw of foretarsus 
single; claw entirely fused with tarsus; forefemur rather stout, little 
if any thicker at base than at first strong spine. 

Table I, below, is the checklist of the known species of Ghilianella 
in the Americas. Included are 88 species of which the males of 56 
and the females of GO are known. The origin of the holotype is also 
given. The keys to both sexes follow the table.

Head conspicuously granulate; eyes small. Interantennal spine 
almost straight. 

Thoracic segments conspicuously granulate; lengths of segments: 
3.5. 2.9, 1.4 mm. Armature of forefemur with inner row consisting 
of short setae arising from small warts. Claws of foretarsi two, the 
inner very short, closely appressed to base of outer. First spine of 
forefemur at slightly over three times its length from tip of trochanter. 
Basal half of forefemur gradually thickened to first spine. 

Abdomen without bulbous swelling, parallel sided. The lateral 
margins of terga shallowly concave. Sixth tergum three-fourths as 
long as fifth, narrower at midlength than fifth; this constriction makes 
the abdomen narrower at base of second segment and at middle of 
sixth. Sterna easily seen from above on each side of terga. Seventh 
tergum abruptly narrowed after basal fifth, thence parallel sided to 
broadly rounded apex, subequal in length to fifth. Hind margins of 
second to sixth sterna straight. Hind margin of seventh and eighth 
sterna shallowly concave medianly. Seventh sternum shorter than 
sixth and longer than eighth, swollen before hind margin on either 
side of median line (fig. 13). Eighth sternum visible on its entire 
width. Spiracle short. Hypopygium at right angle to rest of ab- 
domen; with a quadrate projection on the outside of the upper margin, 
this projection reaching to about midlength of margin; basal half of 
margin raised and reaching to upper margin of clasper: clasper fitting 
between these two raised structures. Apical process of hypopygium 
developed into a long, broad at base, tapering point, most of it hidden 
by the broad claspers. Claspers large, rectangular in lateral aspect, 
upper margin shallowly concave about middle, apical half bent mesad; 
on inner surface near upper margin with a lanceolate appendix parallel 
to and pointing to the base of the clasper (figs. 14, 40). 

Length 20.0 mm. to apex of seventh sternum; 0.3 mm. from the 
latter to apex of hypopygium. 

The vertical position of the hypop}'gium in this species is most 
striking and unique. On account of its unusual position the hypopyg- 
ium, its apical process, and the caudal end of the claspers can be seen 
from a dorsal view of the insect. The shape of the hypopygial struc- 
tures and specially the appendix of the clasper suffice to separate this 
species.

Abdomen on dorsal aspect slender and almost parallel-sided to base 
of fourth segment. Fourth segment expanding apically, apical half 
forming part of bulbosity. Fifth segment the widest, with sub- 
angulate, ridged very slightly produced elevation on apical two- 
thirds close to lateral margins. Sixth segment forming part of 
bulbosity, slightly shorter than fifth, narrower apically. Seventh 
tergum slightly narrower apically than basally, slightly shorter than 
sixth, apical margin very shallowly concave, apical angles slightly 
rounded, with a small inconspicuous median projection (fig. 107). 
Eighth tergum basally slightly over twice as wide as long, one-half 
times as long as ninth, corrugated. Ninth tergum corrugated on basal 
half; apical half narrower, lateral margins depressed, making it more 
convex than basal half, shiny, apical margin concave (fig. 124). 
Hind margin of sixth sternum U-shaped, longer on lateral margins 
than medially. Seventh sternum slightly over twice as long as sixth, 
apical margin broadly produced medially (fig. 50). 

Overall body length 25.0 mm. 

This species is close to approximata but can be easily separated from 
it by the characters in the key and also by having the bulbosity longer 
than wide, while this character is shorter in approximata. 0. pendula 
and gladiator also have the bulbosity longer than wide but otherwise 
they are very different from clavellata.

The shape of the hook o( the hypopygium of this species as well as 
the combination of characters separate this species from others with 
such a hook. The shape o( the basal half of the hypopygial hook is 
slightly different in the paratype; in the paratype it is stouter and 
shorter than in the holotype; otherwise, the two specimens are quite 
similar.

GhUianeUa gibbiventris Champion, 1898, p. 172. 

Some material at hand agree very closely with Champion's descrip- 
tion. A redescription of the species follows: 

Male: Blackish. Legs, beak, and antenna blackish brown. Legs 
inconspicuously annulate. 

Body and legs with short, appressed, scarce yellowish pilosity. 

Head sparsely but distinctly granulosc; eyes moderately large. In- 
terantennal spine long, decurved. 

Thoracic segments sparsely but conspicuously granulate; lengths of 
segments: 3.0, 2.8, 1.5 mm. Armature of forefemur with inner row 
consisting of long and short spines and alternating longer fine setae, the 
setae arising from wartlike bases. Claws of foretarsi two, the inner 
very short and closely appressed to base of outer. First spine of fore- 
femur at nearly twice its length from tip of trochanter. Basal half of 
forefemur gradually thickened to first spine. 

Abdomen with bulbous swelling (fig. 46). Second and third ab- 
dominal segments relatively short, the bulbosity thus strikingly close 
to the thorax. Abdomen gradually widening to middle of fourth 
segment, apical half of fourth segment forming part of bulbosity. 
Fifth segment forming widest part of bulbosity, the margins of the 
tergum produced as lateral carinae and over margin of segment, the 
elevations nearer to posterior margin, gibbous above. Basal half of 
sixth segment forming part of bulbosity, equal in length to fifth. 
Seventh tergum bent upward, narrowed portion beginning at basal 
two-fifths, one and two-thirds times as long as sixth, apical half trans- 
versely corrugate, apex ending in a sharp point, slightly surpassing 
apex of claspers. Hind margins of second to fifth sterna straight, of 
sixth shallowly concave medianly and before lateral margin. Hind 
margin of seventh sternum with a broad V-shaped indentation and 
of eighth shallowly concave. Sixth sternum one and one-half times as 
long as seventh. Seventh sternum with conspicuous lateral basal 
depressions. Eighth sternum visible its entire width, shorter near 
spiracle. Clasper broad to near midlength and narrower apically, 
apical upper angle pointing cephalad. Upper lateral margin of 
hvpopygium bisinuate; with a large apical hook standing clear of the 
sternum, its apex hidden under elaspers (fig. 21). 

Overall body length 20.0 mm. 

The lateral aspect of the hypopygial portion of this species closely 
resembles uncinate. In gibbiventris, the mesothorax is shorter than 
the prothorax, the claspers are narrower apically, and the bulbous 
swelling is strikingly close to the thorax.

G. globifera is the only species having the fourth tergum the widest 
part of the bulbosity. The genitalia of the other three females at 
hand show slight variations from the hypotype. In one the eighth 
tergum is nearly semicircular, but the details of its surface agree with 
those of the hypotype. In another the ninth tergum is relatively 
shorter and broader but otherwise is similar. In the third the ninth 
tergum has a small notch on either side before apex. The hypotype 
was collected in coitu with a specimen that agrees closely with McAtee 
and Malloch's description.

The backward sloping tubercle on the sixth tergum, the projecting 
posterolateral angles of the terga, and the heavily granulated body 
will separate this species from the other short ones; additional infor-

This male specimen has been considered to be longula because the 
thoracic segments very closely agree with those of a female at hand 
identified by McAtee & Malloch as longula. This species is very 
close to simillima and to signoreti. 0. simillima and longula can be 
separated by the characters given in the key; besides, the hind margin 
of the eighth sternum in simillima is undulated medianly while that 
of longula is straight. 0. signoreti has the head and thoracic segments 
granulose instead of smooth as in longula. The females of these 
species can readily be separated by the shape of the seventh sternum. 

Types: Hypotype, male, from Santiago de Cuba, no other data, 
AMNH; two parahypotypes, same data as hypotype, one in AMNH 
and other in author's collection.

This species is very close to productilis, but both sexes can be 
separated from productilis by the characters in the keys. Examina- 
tion of additional males demonstrate the presence of small wartlike 
elevations on the hind margins of the abdominal terga. It should be 
added that the hind margins of the seventh and eighth sterna are 
convex and with a small median semicircular concavity. All the type 
material was collected from a very small extension of Sporobolus 
virginicus growing in the shade of white mangrove and Australian 
pine trees ; this place is probably covered with water during the rainy 
season.

The short projections of the posterolateral angles of the terga of 
nanna may pass unnoticed ; otherwise, the characters in the key will 
easily separate it from rhabdita, galapagensis , mariae, calva, haitiana,

The lengths of the thoracic segments have been used to associate 
the male specimens with the females. This species is very close to 
simillima and longula; it can be distinguished from them by the 
shorter thoracic segments, the slightly greater length of the prothorax 
compared with the mesothorax, the granulation of the head and 
thorax, and the shape of the hind margin of the seventh and eighth 
sterna. The ninth tergum of the female (figs. 73, 140) has a close 
resemblance to that of bicaudata, but otherwise these two species 
are very different. This species seems to be very variable. 

Types: Hypotype, male, Portland Ridge, Clarendon, Jamaica, 
July 22, 1955, T. H. Farr collector, I J. Parahypotypes, seven males, 
from different localities in Jamaica, one in USNM and another in 
author's collection. Five females were also identified, all from 
Jamaica, one in author's collection. These females agree very 
closely with the description given by Wygodzinsky (1951).

Overall body length 23-24 mm. 

The striking appearance of the apical process of the hypopygium 
easily separates the males of this species from all the others. Only 
borincana has a somewhat similar process. The similarity of the 
length of the thoracic segments to those of the female has been used 
to associate the sexes. Figures 51, 86, and 138 show three aspects of 
the end of the abdomen of the female of this species. The ninth 
tergum in profile can be as in figure 2 or straight to the apex.

Previously Described Species Not Included in tbe Keys 

Ghilianella analis (Dohrn) 

Emesa analis Dohrn, 1860, pp. 229-230, fig. 5 (Surinam). 
Ghilianella analis (Dohrn), McAtee and Malloch, 1925, p. 96. 

Tbis species runs to couplet 25 of tbe key to tbe males, as Dobrn's 
illustration sbows tbat tbe hypopygium is not inflated. Tbis condi- 
tion places it close to ica and pachitea. Tbe seventh tergum of tbese 
two species scarcely surpasses the hypopygium while in analis, the 
seventh tergum seems to surpass the claspers by twice their length. 

Ghilianella angulata (Uhler) 

Emesa angulata Uhler, 1893, pp. 717-718. 

Ghilianella angulata (Uhler), McAtee and Malloch, 1925, pp. 128-129. 

This species was not included in the key to females because one 
female deposited in USNM described as this species by McAtee and 
Malloch may well be another species. The specimen runs to couplet 
29 of the key. These characters place it close to insidiatrix and 
amicula. Since these two species belong to the subgenus Ploeodonyx, 
they can be easily separated from angulata, which is in subgenus 
Lissonyx. 

Ghilianella annulata (Dohrn) 

Emesa annulata Dohrn, 1863, pp. 65-66 (South America ?). 
Ghilianella annulata (Dohrn), McAtee and Malloch, 1925, p. 96. 

McAtee and Malloch state: "Closely related to analis, 'last dorsal 
segment scarcely petiolate'. This indicates that the species is to be 
compared with aracataca and may possibly be identical." 

Ghilianella gerstaeckeri (Dohrn) 

Emesa gerstaeckeri Dohrn, 1860, pp. 223-224 (Haiti). 

Ghilianella gerstaeckeri (Dohrn), McAtee and Malloch, 1925, p. 97. 

McAtee and Malloch state: "The present species is said to have the 
sixth (that is seventh) segment bispinose apicalry." 



GHILIANELLA ASSASSIN BUGS — MALDONADO-CAPRILES 449 

Chilianclla gramiltita Champion 

Ghilianella granulata Champion, 1898, pp. 171-172, pi. 10., fig. 19 (British 
Honduras). 

As the terminal segments of the type are missing, this species is 
therefore unidentifiable. 

Chilianclla imbecilla (Dohrn) 

Emesa imbecilla Dohrn, 1860, pp. 228-229 (Para). 

Ghilianella imbecilla (Dohrn), McAtec and Malloch, 1925, p. 97. 

According to McAtee and Malloch, this species may not be identi- 
fiable. "Mid and hind femora each with three pale rings; described 
from a specimen with collapsed abdomen." 

Ghilianella servillei (Spinola) 

Emesa servillei Spinola, 1837, pp. 90-95. 

Ghilianella servillei (Spinola), Wygodzinsky, 1949, p. 29. 

According to Wygodzinsky, this species belongs to Ghilianella. The 
male described by Spinola is insufficiently characterized to be run in 
the key. The prothorax is the longest thoracic region, and the abdo- 
men is parallel sided. 

Ghilianella spinolae Dohrn 

Ghilianella spinolae Dohrn, 1860, p. 238 (Amazon River). 

According to McAtee and Malloch (1925, p. 97): "Abdominal seg- 
ments 1-3 yellow and longer even than mjiliventris indicates a species 
distinct from any here described."

WELCOME MOUND AND THE EFFIGY PIPES 
OF THE ADENA PEOPLE 



By Frank M. Setzler 



The expansion of the Columbia-Southern Chemical Corporation's 
Natrium Plant near New Martinsville, West Virginia, required remov- 
ing two Adena Indian burial mounds on their property. The first, 
known as "Natrium Mound" (46Mr-2), was carefully excavated in 
1948 by Ralph S. Solecki (Solecki, 1953); the second, "Welcome 
Mound" (named after the community "Welcome," 46Mr-3), was 
excavated by me in 1957. 

Appreciating the need to preserve a detailed record of the contents 
of such prehistoric burial sites, Mr. C. E. Wolf, Plant Manager, noti- 
fied the West Virginia Archeological Society and, through it, the 
Smithsonian Institution of the impending program of expansion. In 
addition, the Columbia-Southern Chemical Corporation, a subsidiary 
of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, in 1948 and again in 1957 pro- 
vided laborers, heavy and light machinery, and tools. The Smith- 
sonian Institution provided the archeologists.

Adena People 

Adena burial mounds are common in the Ohio River Valley region. 
It was not, however, until 1901 that the first Adena mound was 
excavated for historical purposes by William C. Mills of the Ohio 
State Museum (Mills, 1902). This mound was on the estate of 
Thomas Worthington (Governor of Ohio, 1814-18) in Ross County, a 
mile northwest of Chillicothe, Ohio. Governor Worthington gave the 
name "Adena" (probably from the Hebrew "Adinah") to his acreage 
on the west side of the Scioto River. Presumably he meant to imply 
"nothing lacking" or, freely translated, "paradise." The name 
"Adena" was adopted by archeologists to refer to the prehistoric 
Indians who built such mounds. 

The middle section of the Ohio River flows through narrow, steep- 
sided valleys with hills rising 600 to 700 feet above the river. Level 
areas occur at various bends in the river, known as bottoms, one such 
being Grave Creek where one of the highest mounds in the United 
States is located, the famous Grave Creek Mound in the center of 
Moundsville, West Virginia. 

The relatively wide, level areas periodically flooded by the Ohio 
River served as ideal village sites for these prehistoric people. The 
environment consisted of a river well-stocked with fish and mollusks, 
and with plenty of fresh water; heavily wooded hills that even now 
support deer, bear, and many other meat-producing animals; and 
sites for garden plots that were annually enriched by flood waters. 
Such an environment was probably an important factor in the tran- 
sition of a nomadic group to a semisedentary one. 

These ecological factors probably enabled a gathering, gardening, 
and hunting people to plant, cultivate, and store vegetables. They 
probably also depended on animals, fish, berries, and wild plants to 
supplement their diet. The large mounds that they built over the 
bodies of their dead are evidence that they remained in one place for a 
considerable time. It is not known how long it took them to build 
Welcome, Natrium, Cresap, or Grave Creek Mounds, which are all 
within a few miles of each other, for we do not know how many people 
worked on these mounds or what kinds of implements they used. 

The prevalence of Adena mounds along the Ohio River and its 
tributaries in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and 
Maryland suggests that this area (fig. 1) became one of the favored 
locations of these people between 800 B.C. and A.D. 800. Here many 
family groups apparently found an environment conducive to settle 
in and built a compact social organization. The mounds that they 
built probably honored certain deceased members of their tribe and 
served as protection for their remains. 



WELCOME MOUND — SETZLER 



453 



The bodies were usually interred extended on their backs with per- 
sonal belongings and ceremonial and political paraphernalia, and were 
surrounded by log and bark structures. The ceremonial objects 
buried with the deceased individual were probably regarded as con- 
tributing to his welfare in after life.

Welcome Mound 

Erecting a tumulus as large as Welcome Mound was a considerable 
undertaking for these people. It measured about 110 feet in diameter 
and 14 feet at the highest point (plate 1). The hundreds of tons of 
dirt were composed of both the thin mantle of topsoil and surrounding 
humus and a loose gravelly soil, interspersed with water-worn pebbles 
ranging in size from a marble to elliptical biconvex pebbles 4 to 5 
inches across. The composition was comparable to that found in 
the Natrium Mound, a mile to the south (Solecki, 1953, pp. 327, 
382, 390). Such a mixture made it difficult for us to dig with shovels 
and trowels. 

In contrast to some of the other large Adena mounds which con- 
tained the remains of many more bodies (Bache and Satterthwaite, 



454 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

1930; Greenman, 1932; Webb and Snow, 1945; and Webb and Baby, 
1957), Welcome Mound contained only three adult human skeletons. 
Two of the bodies were placed on the base near center. There were 
no pits or clay-lined tombs beneath the original surface of the ground 
as were found in the other mounds. The stratum of glacial gravels 
underlying the base probably discouraged such an operation by people 
limited to primitive tools of wood or stone. The badly decomposed 
skeletons were surrounded with the usual channels or molds, caused 
by decayed logs lying in various directions. Layers of bark and the 
residue of perishable things lay both beneath and over the skeletons. 

A mass of thick, coarse, grit-tempered potsherds and a handful 
of fresh-water mollusk shells were found on the same level within a 
few feet of the skeletons. After much effort to restore these hundreds 
of sherds, I was able to construct a large (over 1-foot high) barrel- 
shaped vessel with no neck or constriction and with a flat undecorated 
rim. The rim is % 6 inch thick, and the wall thickens down the side 
to % inch near the rounded base. The outside surface, especially 
near the top, gives the appearance of smoothed-out cord marks. 
In color, it varies from a dark brownish grey at the top, through a 
pinkish tinge, to an off-white base. It is tempered with relatively 
large and coarse water-worn gravelly pebbles. It is not as heavy and 
crude as earlier Adena Fayette Thick pottery, but is in no way 
comparable to the decorated pottery of the contemporaneous Hope- 
well Indians, whose burial mounds are in the same general area. I 
am inclined to place the pottery somewhere between Early and Middle 
Adena periods. 

In the mouth of skeleton No. 3 was found a large tooth (plate 1), 
subsequently identified as the canine tooth of the mountain lion, or 
cougar, Felis concolor. The tooth in this position would seem to 
be of little significance, but this finding must be correlated with 
a previous discovery. W. S. Webb and R. S. Baby in 1949 (Webb 
and Baby, 1957, pp. 61-71) found the front portion of the upper jaw 
of a wolf, cut in the form of a spatula, associated with a human skull 
in the Ayres Mound near New Liberty, Kentucky. This jaw, together 
with the six other known associations of bear, cougar, and wolf 
teeth, establishes an important ceremonial trait among these Adena 
people. Thanks to the meticulous work of Webb and Baby, we now 
know that the Adena people had men who served their society in a 
capacity comparable to that of a shaman, medicine man, or witch 
doctor. 

The mountain lion tooth in the mouth of skeleton No. 3 therefore 
supports the belief that this skeleton is the remains of an important 
religious leader. He was probably buried in a costume that included 
an animal mask. If the bark and other discolorations surrounding

this skeleton could be identified, we would have more specific evidence 
of the paraphernalia and garments— probably the skin of a cougar — 
worn by this intermediary between his people and the spirit world. 
Such an individual would be sufficiently important to justify the 
arduous task of constructing a 14-foot high mound. 

Granulated pieces of charcoal found at the base of the mound and 
in association with burials 2 and 3 were tested for Carbon-14 by 
Michigan-Memorial Phoenix Project No. 6. Dr. James B. Griffin 
of the University of Michigan has relayed the results of sample M-903 
as 2300 plus or minus 200 years before the present, or about 341 B.C. 

Effigy Pipes 

The most unusual object recovered during the excavation of Wel- 
come Mound was the straight-tubular, duck-effigy pipe (USNM 
417000). One can readily see (plate 2) that the prehistoric sculptor 
responsible for carving the duck effigy was gifted, as he reproduced 
almost to scale the head, neck, and bill of a shoveler duck, Spatula 
clypeata (Linnaeus). In using Ohio limestone, he had the advantage 
of its softness when freshly dug. After it is exposed to the air, it 
becomes hard and brittle. This peculiarity was noticed when I 
cleaned the dirt from around the pipe. The bristles of the whisk 
broom made slight scratches. I had to use a camel's hair brush in- 
stead. Several days later the limestone was much harder. 

The pipe was found 5 inches from the right knee of skeleton No. 1 
(plate 1), 6 feet beneath the crest of the mound and 8 feet directly 
above burial No. 3 in square N18-W1. The body had been buried in 
a north-south direction with feet pointing to the north. The bones 
being articulated indicated that the body was buried in the flesh on its 
back. It was surrounded by a greenish-grey oily clay, which was en- 
closed with heavy bark. The acidity of these bark coverings (oak or 
walnut) seems to have given the bones a reddish cast. On three sides 
were imprints or molds 18 inches in diameter left by the decomposed 
logs. The bones of the skeleton are heavy and are judged to be 
those of a middle-aged male. 

The pipe measures Q% inches in length. The tubular end is 1 inch 
in diameter on the outside, and the diameter of the drilled hole is 
% inch. The widest part of the bill is IV 2 inches. Near the head 
back of the eyes, it is 1% 6 inches wide. The narrowest part of the bill, 
directly in front of the eyes is 1 %% inches wide. The 3 / 16 inch open- 
ing in the bill or mouthpiece is elliptical. The eye sockets are % 
inch in diameter and are 2% inches from the end of the bill. The 
underside of the bill clearly suggests the lamellae characteristic of 
shoveler ducks (plate 2). 



456 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

The pipe is thus basically tubular in shape and gracefully carved to 
represent the neck, head, and bill of a shoveler duck. The two 
countersunk holes, representing eye sockets, could have been filled 
with a perishable substance to represent the pupils. The relatively 
flat, expanded bill served as the mouthpiece. The circular bore runs 
to within % inch from the mouthpiece, where the hole is reduced 
from % inch to an elliptical opening of jU inch. 

Straight tubular effigy pipes have also been found in other Adena 
mounds. The most famous one is the human effigy pipe, found by 
Mills in 1901 in the Adena Mound on Governor Worthington's estate 
near Chillicothe, Ohio. This pipe is reproduced here (plate 3) through 
the kindness of Raymond S. Baby of the Ohio State Museum. It 
was carved from multicolored Ohio pipestone also in the form of a 
straight tube and represents the body of an achondroplastic (chondro- 
dystrophic) dwarf, as is apparent from the short heavy-set muscular 
torso, stubby arms and legs, enlarged head, and swollen (goiter) neck. 
This pipe has been regarded by both archeologists and artists as one 
of the sculptured masterpieces of American Art. Until now, it was 
the only effigy pipe ever described from an Adena Mound. 

Soon after the Welcome Mound pipe was discovered, a cast of a 
similar duck effigy pipe was located in the Division of Archeology of 
the Ohio State Museum. The original, now in the Dayton Museum of 
Natural History, was reported found in loose dirt while the Englewood 
Mound, near Dayton, Ohio, was being levelled by a bull-dozer during 
the building of a dam in the early 1930's. The pipe is illustrated 
here (plate 4) by permission of Mr. E. J. Koestner, Director of the Day- 
ton Museum. The length is Qji inches, the diameter of the neck is 
% inch, and the widest part of the bill is 1% inches. The length 
from the end of the neck to the center of the eye socket is exactly 
4 inches, the same length as the Welcome Mound pipe. 

Two effigy pipes were uncovered in the excavation of a mound in 
Sayler Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, by the Cincinnati Museum of Natural 
History. One is a well-proportioned clay effigy of an aquatic bird 
and was found in association with one of the burials. The director 
of the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History, Mr. Ralph Dury, very 
kindly sent me photographs of this pipe, as well as of another that 
represents the head of a wolf. These pipes were excavated under the 
supervision of Dr. James Kellar and S. Frederick Starr and are re- 
produced here (plate 4) by permission of Mr. Dury. On the basis of 
these and other artifacts recovered, we must assume that Sayler Park 
Mound was also built over the interred bodies of Adena people. 

Since straight-tubular effigy pipes were made exclusively by the 
Adena, they are a diagnostic culture trait of these people. The 
carving of objects as artistic as these pipes certainly represents an 



WELCOME MOUND — SETZLEK 457 

artistic talent beyond that of an ordinary member of a society. To 
what extent the making of pipes indicates specialized professions, 
however, is difficult to determine. 

The duck effigy pipe from Welcome Mound appears to be related 
in some way to the person buried beside it and to a mortuary cus- 
tom of the Adena people. Moreover, it may indicate some religious 
significance associated with a shoveler duck. The same reverence 
postulated here for the shoveler duck may be applied to the wolf and 
unidentified aquatic-bird effigy pipes from Saylor Mound. 

The human effigy pipe from Adena Mound could well represent a 
particular individual. A person possessing the physical and patho- 
logical characteristics apparent in the effigy was likely regarded as 
unique and thereby deified; actual dwarf skeletons have been recov- 
ered in Adena mounds. 

Among numerous primitive people, the smoking of tobacco or some 
herb was regarded as sacred or an important part of a ceremonial 
function. As we know from early European contacts with North 
American Indians, the smoking of a peace pipe attended all important 
political as well as religious or ceremonial functions. Possibly these 
effigy pipes and the more common plain pipe (plate 4) found in the 
mounds of the Adena represent the origin of such a ceremony. Our 
only evidence rests with similar forms used by historic Indians and 
reported by early Spanish, French, and English explorers and 
missionaries. 

Several monographs have been published on this topic, e.g., G. A. 
West (1934) and H. C. Shetrone (1941). These men not only illus- 
trate various other kinds of pipes, but quote from hundreds of sources 
describing the variety of uses that were made of the many forms of 
Nicotiana. When we consider the impact that tobacco had upon the 
countries of the world after 1492, it is understandable that the prob- 
able original users of this herb buried pipes — especially such well 
carved pipes — as offerings to their dead. 

Summary 

The burial methods, the type of pottery and restored vessel, the 
date from Carbon-14 tests, the effigy pipe, and the association of 
an animal tooth in the mouth cavity are sufficient evidence to estab- 
lish Welcome Mound as an Adena burial site. The wearing of an 
animal mask indicates that such a person could have served as a 
shaman and as such would justify the building of Welcome Mound. 
The effigy pipes indicate a possible religious association between the 
prehistoric Adena and aquatic birds, animals, and dwarfs, while the 
artistry shows an advance over the common straight tubes of the 
earlier, archaic people and those of the Adena.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW BATS FROM PANAMA 



By Charles O. Handley, Jr. 



In its studies of tropical diseases, the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory 
of Panama is conducting a mammal surve3 r of the Republic. The 
work in 1959 centered on the headwaters of the Rio Pucro, near Cerro 
Tacarcuna, Province of Darien, eastern Panama. 

Among the mammals collected on the Rio Pucro were 43 species of 
bats, all caught in mist nets. Many of these species had not been 
taken previously in Central America. Three species and one sub- 
species herein described are new. Either there is a surprising amount 
of endemism in this region, which is continuous with the Choco of 
Colombia, or else there are a surprising number of undescribed wide- 
spread species of bats in the Neotropical fauna. 

The Malaria Control and Survey Branch of the Office of the Chief 
Surgeon, U.S. Army Caribbean, has also been collecting bats in Pan- 
ama. Included in its collections are several species not previously 
taken in the Republic and one of the new subspecies here described. 

I am indebted to the personnel of the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory, 
particularly Carl Johnson, Pedro Galindo, and Rudolpho Hinds for 
their support and cooperation. Likewise, I thank Robert Altman, 
Marvin Keenan, and Vernon Tipton of the Malaria Control and 
Survey Branch for their assistance and for the opportunity to study 
their collections. I am also grateful to the authorities of the American

Museum of Natural History (AMNH), Academy of Natural Sciences 
of Philadelphia (ANSP), Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM), 
and Harvard University Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) for 
allowing me to study specimens under their care. 

Capitalized color terms in the following descriptions are from Ridg- 
way (Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, 1912). All measure- 
ments are in millimeters and are explained in Handley (1959, pp. 98-99). 

Mimon crenulatum keenani, new subspecies 

Holotype: USNM 311951, adult male, skin and skull, collected 
August 25, 1959, by C. M. Keenan, Fort Gulick, Panama Canal Zone, 
original number 4127. 

Distribution: Central Panama to northwestern Venezuela and 
western Ecuador. The Panamanian specimen was found in the day- 
time hanging on the outside of a decayed hollow stump in a sparsely 
wooded area. The Ecuadorean specimens likewise were taken in a 
hollow rotted tree stump in a wooded area (Tate, 1931, p. 250). 

Description: Dorsum bright mahogany brown (between Carob 
Brown and Black); individual hairs monocolored from base to tip; 
prominent j T ellowish-white median stripe from forehead to base of 
tail; large prominent yellow-orange spots at posterior bases of ears. 
Underparts orangish, individual hairs fuscous at base. Membranes 
and ears blackish. Noseleaf hairy, slightly crenulated at base; wing 
membranes attached to metatarsus; calcar long. Rostrum relatively 
long, shallow, and dorsally flattened; sagittal crest relatively low; 
posterior extension of palate relatively long and broad; molariform 
teeth broad and massive. 

Measurements: See table 1. 

Comparisons: Brighter and more ornate than the contiguous races 
crenulatum and longijolium. Rostrum longer and slightly deeper, 
posterior palatal elongation longer and broader, teeth larger, and 
calcar longer than in crenulatum. Rostrum shallower and dorsally 
flatter than in longijolium. 

Remarks: The nominal genera Anihorhina and Mimon are not 
distinguishable even as subgenera. The bats of Anihorhina differ 
from those of Mimon principally in having a smaller anterior upper 
premolar (P 1 ); shorter lower incisor; larger auditory bulla; stouter 
z}^gomatic arch; shorter, less woolly fur; smaller ears; and hairy 
noseleaf. 

It is doubtful that either of the nominal genera contains more than 
a single species. Dalquest (1957, p. 45) cleared up some of the con- 
fusion surrounding the supposed species M. bennettii and cozumelae, 
presently known only by a few specimens from Brazil and Mexico, 
respectively. Dalquest failed, however, to note that his only speci- 
men of bennettii was a juvenile, and that he distinguished it from his

adult cozumelae on the basis of its juvenile characters — smaller size; 
darker, less ornate coloration; and bulging braincase. Apparently 
bennettii and cozumelae are very similar, but until adult specimens of 
each are compared, their true relationship cannot be determined. 

Four species have been named in Anthorhina, but all seem to have 
been based on distortions of preservation or individual, seasonal, or 
geographic variations of a single species. Crenulation and hairiness 
of the noseleaf are individually variable throughout. The wings 
apparently are always inserted on the distal portion of the metatarsus, 
but this feature may be obscured by labels tied to the ankle. The 
calcar varies individually and geographically, and often is difficult to 
measure accurately in preserved specimens. Coloration varies with 
age and season, as well as geographically. Coloration of the fresh 
adult pelage approximates black and white, but with age these colors 
became progressively obscured with yellow, orange, and reddish. 
Juveniles are duller, blacker, and have less prominent markings than 
adults. Crowding of the maxillary tooth row is individually variable. 
Size of the ears in dried specimens depends to some extent on the 
conditions of drying. 

The genus Mimon includes the following: 

Mimon bennettii Gray: Type locality Ipanema, Sao Paulo, Brazil; 
and Mimon cozumelae Goldman: Type locality Cozumel Island, 
Quintana Roo, Mexico, diagnosis: Body size large (forearm aver- 
ages 55 mm.) ; coloration pale brownish, unmarked except for whitish 
postauricular patches; fur long and woolly; ears very large; noseleaf 
plain, naked; anterior upper premolar (P 1 ) about equal to inner upper 
incisor (I 1 ) in size; lower incisor longer than wide; auditory bullae 
small; zygomata fragile, specimens examined: M. bennettii: Brazil: 
Ipanema, Sao Paulo, 1, USNM. M. cozumelae: Mexico: Cozumel 
Island, Quintana Roo, 1, MCZ, 2 including type of cozumelae, USNM; 
Izamel, Yucatan, 2, USNM. 

Mimon crenulatum crenulatum E. Geoffroy St. Hilaire: Type locality, 
Brazil. 1 diagnosis: body size small (forearm averages 50 mm.) ; dorsal 
coloration blackish-brown, marked with whitish postauricular patch and 
median dorsal stripe, both varying from fairly prominent to obscure; 
fur medium-long, lax; underparts whitish to rusty, bases of hairs 
grayish ; cars large ; noseleaf more or less crenulated on margins toward 
the base, fringed with long hairs; P 1 about equal to I 2 in size; lower 
incisor as wide as long; auditory bullae large; zygomata stout; rostrum 



1 Cabrera (1958, p. 66) further restricted the type locality to Bahia, hut in view of the uncertainty of the 
distribution of variation in the species in eastern Brazil, the restriction appears premature and perhaps 
detrimental. Present indications are that the subspecies crenulatum occurs at least from eastern Venezuela 
and Trinidad to the lower Amazon. 



NEW BATS FROM PANAMA — HANDLEY 463 

relatively short, shallow, and posteriorly narrowed; posterior palatal 
extension short and narrow; sagittal crest relatively low; molariform 
teeth relatively small, specimens examined: Brazil: Santarem, 
Rio Tapajoz, 4, MCZ. Trinidad: Port-of-Spain, 1, AMNH. 

Mimon crenulatum keenani Handley: Type locality, Fort Gulick, 
Panama Canal Zone, diagnosis: see description and comparisons 
above. Specimens from Rio Tocuyo, Venezuela, show intergradation 
with crenulatum. These are as ornate as typical keenani, but are 
duller and have gray ventral hair bases. In shape of rostrum and 
shortness of calcar, they approach crenulatum. Specimens from Bahia 
de Caraquez, Ecuador, seem to show intergradation with longifolium. 
Colorwise they are close to keenani, but are slightly duller and have 
gray based ventral hairs. Skull is most like that of longifolium. 
specimens examined: Ecuador: Bahia de Caraquez, 5, AMNH. 
Panama Canal Zone: Fort Gulick, 1, USNM. Venezuela: Rio 
Tocuyo, 500 meters, 16, AMNH. 

Mimon crenulatum longifolium Wagner: Type locality, Villa Maria, 
Mato Grosso, Brazil (peruanum Thomas, type locality Rfo Pachitea, 
Huanuco, Peru, is a synonym), diagnosis: This is the least ornate 
subspecies. Dorsal coloration dull blackish brown; ventral hairs 
gray based; postauricular patches and median dorsal stripe usually 
reduced, often obscure, and occasionally absent; rostrum relatively 
long, deep, and not dorsally flattened; sagittal crest high; calcar long. 
specimens examined: Brazil: Cacao Pereira Igarape, Rio Negro, 3, 
AMNH; Santo Antonio da Uayara, Rio Madeira, 4, AMNH. Colom- 
bia: Tahuapunto, Rio Vaupes, 8, AMNH. Ecuador: Boca de Rio 
Curaray, 1, AMNH. Peru: Montealegre ?, 2, AMNH. Venezuela: 
Mount Duida, 350 meters, 1, AMNH. No exact locality, 1, USNM. 

Mimon crenulatum picatum Thomas: Type locality, Lamarao, 300 
meters, Bahia, Brazil, diagnosis: Apparently similar to crenulatum 
in length of calcar and rostrum, but may be brighter and more ornate 
in coloration. M. c. picatum may be a synonym of crenulatum, or it 
may represent a bright-colored southeastern population. It is 
known only by Thomas' type specimen. 

Anoura cultrata, new species 

Holotype: USNM 309396, adult female, skin and skull, collected 
February 7, 1959, by Charles O. Handley, Jr., and B. R. Feinstein, 
Tacarcuna Village, 3,200 ft., Rio Pucro, Darien, Panama, original 
number 4747. 

Distribution: Known only from the type locality, where in Febru- 
ary and March 1959 eight specimens were caught in mist nets set over 
a stream in a mountain forest. 



464 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Description: Coloration shiny blackish (between Blackish Brown-3 
and Black) throughout; individual hairs of dorsum pale grayish on 
basal two-thirds, those of underparts black to base. Pelage short 
and crisp ; interf emoral membrane reduced to a narrow, densely furred 
band; tail present. Skull most like that of Anoura geoffroyi, but dif- 
fering as follows: larger; braincase more tapering anteriorly; rostrum 
thickened; zj^gomata complete; posterior margin of palate more deeply 
incised beside posterior palatal extension; pterygoids inflated pos- 
teriorly so as to narrow the elongated mesopterygoid fossa. Sym- 
physial region of mandibles shortened and trough between canines 
deepened and broadened (anterior end of mandible correspondingly 
depressed) ; coronoid process reduced in height ; ventral edge of man- 
dible with a low process just anterior to the angular process. Outer 
upper incisor (I 2 ) enlarged, bladelike; upper canine enlarged, roughly 
triangular in cross-section at base, with distinct anterointernal, antero- 
external, and posterior basal cusps; internal face anteroposteriorly 
concave, and anterior face flat, with prominent longitudinal sulcus 
from base of crown to near tip , P 3 and P 4 reduced in height and thick- 
ness and in prominence of cusps; M 2 and M 3 reduced in size; lower 
canine reduced in height, with distinct cingulum on anterior and in- 
ternal faces, and with a posterointernal cingular cusp ; anterior lower 
premolar (P x ) bladelikc and enormously enlarged (lengthened and 
thickened), with its highest point in the posterior half of the tooth; 
P 3 and P 4 reduced in height and thickness and in prominence of cusps. 

Measurements (holotype): Total length 94, tail vertebrae 6, hind 
foot 14, ear from notch 16, forearm 43.2, tibia 15.9, calcar 3.8. Great- 
est length of skull 26.3, zygomatic breadth 10.7, interorbital breadth 
4.7, braincase breadth 10.3, braincase depth 8.0, maxillary tooth row 
length 9.0, postpalatal length 9.4, palate breadth outside of M 3 5.7, 
rostral breadth at base of canines 4.7. 

Comparisons: Probably the closest relative of cultrata is Anoura 
geqffroyi, but as indicated in the description above it is strongly dif- 
ferentiated from this species in many characters. 

Specimens examined: Panama: Tacarcuna Village, 3,200 ft., Rio 
Pucro, Darien, 8, USNM. 

Chiroderma gorgasi, new species 

Holotype: USNM 309903, adult male (testis 6x3 mm.), skin 
and skull, collected March 6, 1959, by Charles O. Handley, Jr., and 
B. R. Fcinstein, Tacarcuna Village, 3,200 ft., Rio Pucro, Darien, 
Panama, original number 5436. 

Distribution: Known only from the type locality in eastern Pan- 
ama, where five individuals were caught in February and March 1959 
in mist nets set over a stream in a mountain forest. 



NEW BATS FROM PANAMA — HANDLEY 465 

Description: Body size small (forearm 37.5-38.5 mm., greatest 
length of skull 20.2-20.9 mm.). Dorsal coloration yellowish brown, 
brown (between Sudan Brown and Prout's Brown in holotype), or 
grayish, paler anteriorly; a white median stripe extends from upper 
back to base of tail; prominent white stripes above and below eye, 
extending from noseleaf to crown at inner base of ear and from pos- 
terior part of upper lip to outer base of ear; area about eye a little 
darker than remainder of body; individual hairs of dorsum tricolored, 
dusky at base, bufl'y medially, and brown or gray at tip; underparts 
uniformly grayish or brownish gray, very slightly washed with whitish. 
Membranes blackish; tragus and basal portion and margins of ear 
yellow; tip of ear yellowish gray. Eye large; noseleaf broad, with 
simple tip; interfemoral membrane hairy at base but naked on pos- 
terior margin. Nasal aperture short, extending only to level of 
anterior edge of orbits; supraorbital region scarcely ridged, but lachry- 
mal region sharply ridged; sagittal and lambdoidal crests poorly de- 
veloped; inner upper incisors slender; canines and P 4 low, but anterior 
lower premolar (Pi) large and anterior cusp half or two-thirds the 
height of P 4 . 

Measurements: Male holotype of gorgasi, followed by female para- 
type (USNM 309902), and in parentheses the female holotype of 
trinitatum: total length 56, 57 (-) ; hind foot 10, 11 (12); ear from 
notch 17, 18 (15 in alcohol) ; forearm 38.5, 37.6 (41.0); tibia 12.4, 12.4 
(15.2) ;calcar 4.9, 4.5 (4.5). Greatest length of skull 20.9, 20.7 (22.2); 
zygomatic breadth 12.8, 13.1 (13.9) ; interorbital breadth 5.4, 5.6 (5.6) ; 
braincase breadth 9.4, 9.6 (9.8); braincase depth 7.8, 7.9 (7.8); maxil- 
lary tooth row length 7.3, 7.3 (7.7); postpalatal length 5.4, 6.0 (5.8); 
palatal breadth outside of M 3 9.5, 9.4 (9.7); rostral breadth behind 
canines 4.8, 4.9 (5.1). 

Comparisons: The closest relative of gorgasi appears to be trinita- 
tum Goodwin, which is known only by the type specimen from Trini- 
dad. Together these species stand well apart from all other known 
Chiroderma, and additional collecting may show them to be conspecific. 
C. gorgasi may be distinguished from trinitatum by smaller size; 
relatively broader skull; relatively deeper braincase and more bulging 
forehead; shorter rostrum; sharper lachrymal ridge; more rounded 
supraorbital region; heavier zygomata; larger outer upper incisors 
(I 2 ); shorter (anterior-posterior) M 1 . Coloration of trinitatum is 
unknown. 

The facial stripes, small size, low canines and P 4 , large Pi, short 
nasal aperture, and lack of a supraorbital ridge are characters of 
gorgasi that distinguish it from the sympatric lyillosum Peters and 
salvini Dobson. 



466 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Remarks: Chiroderma jesupi J. A. Allen (1900), known only by 
the type specimen from northern Colombia, was described as a small 
species. The type is a juvenile with phalangeal epiphyses not ossified. 
It is the same as the bat subsequently described as C. isthmicum by 
Miller (1912), and it is conspecific with Chiroderma villosum Peters, 
type locality Brazil (not Venezuela as stated by Cabrera, 1958, p. 85). 
The valid species of the genus Chiroderma are thus as follows : 

Chiroderma doriae Thomas: type locality, Minas Gerais, Brazil {dor sale 

Lund and villosum Dobson are synonyms). 
Chiroderma gorgasi Handley: type locality, Tacarcuna Village, Darien, 

Panama. 
Chiroderma salvini Dobson: type locality, Costa Rica. 
Chiroderma trinitatum Goodwin: type locality, Cumaca, Trinidad. 
Chiroderma villosum villosum Peters: type locality, Brazil. 
Chiroderma villosum jesupi J. A. Allen: type locality, Cacagualito, Santa 

Marta, Colombia (isthmicum Miller is a synonym). 

Specimens examined: C. gorgasi: Panama: Tacarcuna Village,

Myotis simus riparius, new subspecies 

Holotype: USNM 310255, adult female (with one embryo, 7 mm. 
crown-rump), skin and skull, collected February 9, 1959, by Charles O. 
Handley, Jr., and B. R. Feinstein, Tacarcuna Village, 3,200 ft., Rio 
Pucro, Darien, Panama, original number 4843. 

Distribution: Eastern Panama. 

Description: Fur short and woolly; dorsum buffy brown (between 
Warm Sepia and Bister) ; individual hairs slightly burnished at tip, 
slightly grayer toward base; underparts yellowish brown, individual 
hairs fuscous at base; lips, ears, membranes, and feet blackish. Calcar 
keeled; wing membrane attached to foot at base of toes. Body size 
large; zygomata heavy and wide spreading; braincase relatively nar- 
row; sagittal and lambdoidal crests high and forming a triangular 



NEW BATS FROM PANAMA — HANDLEY 467 

"helmet" at their juncture in the interparietal region; rostrum long 
and shallow; inner cutting edge of outer upper incisor (I 2 ) usually not 
crenulated; middle upper premolar (P 3 ) about two-thirds the size of 
P 1 ; M 1 and M 2 with protoconule, hypocone, metaloph, and cingulum 
fairly well developed. 

Measurements: Holotype and a female paratype (USNM 310256) 
from the t} r pe locality, together with measurements, in parentheses, 
of two female topotypes of simus (AMNH 76244 and 76246) : Total 
length 89, 86 (-, -) ; tail vertebrae 40, 36 (-, -) ; hind foot 8, 8 (9, 10) ; 
ear from notch 14, 13 (-, -); forearm 39.1, 35.7 (-, -); tibia 14.3, 13.5 
(-, -); calcar 12.8, 13.2 (-, -). Greatest length of skull 13.9, 13.8 
(14.0, 13.7); zygomatic breadth 8.8, 8.9 (9.4, -); intcrorbital breadth 
3.5, 3.5 (3.9, 3.7) ; braincase breadth 6.4, 6.3 (7.0, 6.7) ; braincase depth 
5.0, 5.0 (5.1, 4.9); maxillary tooth row length 5.3, 5.4 (5.1, 5.1); post- 
palatal length 4.5, 4.7 (4.7, 4.6) ; palatal breadth outside of M 3 5.5, 5.7 
(5.7, 5.2); rostral breadth behind canines 3.7, 3.6 (4.0, 3.8). 

Comparisons: Compared with Amazonian simus, the Panamanian 
specimens have the rostrum longer, shallower, and narrower at the 
tip; the braincase narrower, less inflated; the tooth row is longer and 
less crowded; the middle upper premolar (P 3 ) is larger (two-thirds 
the size of P 1 as opposed to one-fourth to one-third the size of P 1 ); 
the protoconule, hypocone, metaloph, and cingulum are better devel- 
oped in M 1 and M 2 ; the inner cutting edge of the outer upper incisor 
(I 2 ) is entire in four of six specimens, rather than consistently crenu- 
lated ; the sagittal crest is lower and expanded at the juncture with 
the lambdoidal crests in the interparietal region to form a triangular 
helmet not seen in the Amazonian specimens; the fur of the dorsum 
is slightly longer and more burnished (thus brighter). 

Remarks: Coloration and length of fur are seasonally variable in 
simus. In a series of sixteen specimens from Boca de Rio Curaray, 
Ecuador, those collected in February and March have short (2-3 mm. 
on rump), orange-brown fur, with the individual hairs monocolored 
on all parts of the body. The remainder of the series, collected in 
October and December, are quite different in appearance. The fur 
is longer (3-4 mm. on rump), chocolate brown, with slightly burnished 
tips, and the individual hairs of the underparts are sharply bicolored. 
Several Brazilian and Peruvian specimens (e.g. AMNH 74378, 74380, 
74105, 91889, 92702) show molt from short, orange, monocolored fur 
to the longer, brown, bicolored pelage. 

Several characters ascribed to simus by Thomas (1901, p. 541) and 
subsequent authors cannot be substantiated in the specimens of 
simus that I have examined. Most important is the supposed inser- 
tion of the wing at the ankle. Possibly this feature had been distorted 
in Thomas' specimen by labels tied to the ankles, as in the two USNM 

544232—60 2 



468 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

specimens relaxed by Miller (1928, p. 206). Actually the wing is 
attached to the foot at the base of the toes in simus as in most other 
My otis. The calcaral keel, described as practically absent, indeed 
is absent in a few specimens, but as a rule it is well developed. The 
width of the rostrum and crowding of the maxillary tooth row are 
geographically variable. Coloration and length of fur are seasonably 
variable. 

Thus, Myotis simus is not so strikingly differentiated from other 
species of Myotis as Thomas and Miller supposed, and there is little 
basis for the subgeneric name Hesperomyotis proposed for it by 
Cabrera (1958, p. 103). 

The Panamanian specimens were caught in mist nets set over 
streams in a lowland semideciduous forest and a mountain forest, and 
at the edge of a clearing in a mountain forest. 

Specimens examined: M. s. riparius: Panama: Boca de Paya,

Lasiurus castaneus, new species 

Holotype: USNM 310263, adult female (with 2 embryos, 13 mm. 
crown rump), skin and skull, collected March 6, 1959, by Charles O. 
Handley, Jr., and B. R. Feinstein, Tacarcuna Village, 3,200 ft., Rio 
Pucro, Darien, Panama, original number 5445. 

Distribution: Known only from the type locality, where a single 
specimen was taken in a mist net over a stream in a mountain forest. 

Description: Dorsum deep chestnut (between Morocco Red and 
Chestnut), shading on rump, interfemoral membrane, and feet to 
mahoganj r (between Maroon and Claret Brown); median band of 
individual dorsal hairs Cinnamon-Rufous; individual hairs tricolored, 
with individual bands (black-amber-chestnut) about equal in extent; 
face and muzzle, entirely black; underparts blackish brown with only 
scattered buff-tipped hairs except on collar; throat not differentiated 
from remainder of underparts in color; hairs surrounding white 
humeral spot black tipped; ears, wings, membranes, paid lips entirely 
blackish. Distal fourth of interfemoral membrane naked; auricle 
and antitragus relatively large. M 3 much reduced, second com- 



NEW BATS FROM PANAMA — HANDLEY 469 

missure shorter than first; hypocone much reduced on M 1 and M 2 ; 
P 4 double rooted. Rostrum broad and deep; lachrymal ridge not 
developed; braincase narrow, deep, and tilted up away from plane of 
palate. Otherwise similar to Lasiurus borealis. 

Measurements of holotype: Total length 112, tail vertebrae 
48, hind foot 11, ear from notch 14, forearm 44.8, tibia 19.5, calcar 
15.1. Greatest length of skull 13.0, zygomatic breadth 9.9, inter- 
orbital breadth 4.2, braincase breadth 7.6, braincase depth 6.2, 
maxillary tooth row length 4.7, postpalatal length 5.7, palatal breadth 
at M 3 6.7, rostral breadth at canine 5.7. 

Comparisons: Lasiurus castaneus is a member of the borealis group. 
Its coloration is unique, and extreme tilting of the braincase rlative- 
to the palatal plane and reduction of parts of the upper molaers like 
wise set it apart from other species of the borealis group. In overall 
size and in size of auricle and antitragus it resembles the remote 
northern borealis and southern varius, but its wings are unusually 
long. Like seminolus it lacks development of a lachrymal ridge, 
has a black face, and has the median band of the dorsal hairs reduced. 
Like varius it has black ears and membranes and darkened face. It 
scarcely needs comparison with the sympatric Jrantzii, which is much 
smaller, paler and brighter colored, and plain faced and has a glo- 
bose braincase and a shorter, narrower rostrum. 

Remarks : Variation in coloration is remarkably slight in the borealis 
group. Specimens from California (teliotis), Central America (Jrant- 
zii), and Chile (varius) are scarcely distinguishable colorwise. Dif- 
ferentiation in coloration has occurred in the extreme northeast 
(borealis) and extreme southeast (blossevillii) along similar lines — 
overlay of the red mass effect with white (sort of a "frosting"). 
< 'astaneus in Central America, seminolus in the northeast, and perhaps 
egregius in Brazil, appear to be independent variables. Sexual 
dimorphism in size and coloration is marked in borealis and seminolus 
but is slight in western North America, Central America, and South 
America (see also table 2 on next page). Extension of fur onto the 
membranes varies with latitude and perhaps with altitude (more at 
higher latitudes, less at lower latitudes) and is of limited taxonomic 
value. 

Bats of the mainland of North and South America that belong to 
the Lasiurus borealis group are: 

Lasiurus borealis blossevillii Lesson and Garnot : Type locality, 
Montevideo, Uruguay (bonariensis Lesson, Buenos Aires, Argentina; 
enslenii Lima, Sao Lourengo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil; and salinae 
Thomas, Cruz del Eje, Cordoba, Argentina, are probably synonyms). 
diagnosis: slightly larger than Jrantzii, smaller than varius (larger 
toward the south) ; dorsum washed with whitish ("frosted") ; reddish

Lasiurus borealis teliotis H. Allen; Type locality, unknown, probably 
California (ornatus Hall, Penuela, near Cordoba, Veracruz, is a syno- 
nym), diagnosis: larger than frantzii but similar to it in coloration 
(slightly paler northward) and cranial characters, specimens exam- 
ined: many from the western United States, Baja California, Jalisco, 
Michoacan, Oaxaca, and Veracruz. 

Lasiurus borealis varius Poeppig: Type locality, Antuco, Bio-Bio, 
Chile (poepingii Lesson is a synonym), diagnosis: much larger than 
frantzii; similar to frantzii in color, except for darker face; ears and 
membranes entirely black; lachrymal ridge developed, specimens 
examined: Chile: Angol, 3 AMNH; Maquehue, Temuco, 1, AMNH,

type, the only known specimen) ; dorsum bright rufous, darkening 
almost to chestnut on interfemoral membrane; face noticeably more 
red tinged than crown and nape; underparts bright red; membranes 
black (this diagnosis is from notes that G. S. Miller, Jr., made at the 
Berlin Museum in the early 1900's). 

Lasiurus seminolus Ilhoads: Type locality, Tarpon Springs, Pinellas 
County, Florida, diagnosis: similar in size to borealis; dorsum ma- 
hogany, washed with whitish; black basal band of dorsal hairs the 
dominant band; face black; ears and membranes with reddish mark- 
ings; females larger than males, but similar in coloration; juveniles 
darker; lachrymal ridge not developed, specimens examined: many 
from southeastern United States. 

It should be noted that previous authors have followed Peters (1871) 
in aligning egregius with the genus Dasypterus, because it lacked the 
minute upper premolar (P 1 ), although in other characters it agreed 
with the borealis group of the genus Lasiurus. Absence of P 1 in a 
single specimen of Lasiurus {egregius apparently is still known only 
by the type specimen) is not significant, for although P 1 seems always 
to be absent in Dasypterus, it is also absent in one or both maxillae 
of about 10 percent of Lasiurus. Table 3, on page 475, lists some 
of the conspicuous differences between the species of Lasiurus and 
Dasypterus. More impressive are the following similarities linking 
these nominal genera and distinguishing them from other vesperti- 
lionids and in some cases from all other bats : 

Four mammae and average of two or three young per litter. 

Spiral effect in scale arrangement on hairs. 

Reduction of sebaceous glandular tissue and location of the submaxillary 

salivary gland in the facial area. 
Bright coloration. 

Baculum short, J-shaped, with high base and narrow shaft. 
Distally enlarged and spiny penis. 
Furry interfemoral membrane. 

It seems more reasonable to stress the important similarities of 
these bats and regard them as congeneric, rather than to stress the 
insignificant differences and regard them as representing distinct gen- 
era. I do not believe that Dasypterus is useful even as a subgenus. 

Recent bats of the ega group may be arranged in the genus Lasiurus 
as follows: 

Lasiurus ega argentinus Thomas: Type locality, Goya, Corrientes, 
Argentina (caudatus Tomes, Pernambuco, Brazil, is a synonym).

total of 47, including the type, from Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, 
and Louisiana. 

Lasiurus intermedins H. Allen: Type locality, Matamoros, Tamau- 
lipas, Mexico, diagnosis: dorsum clear yellowish orange with very 
fine blackish wash (brighter, clearer orange than panamensis, with 
which it is sympatric) ; hairs of interfemoral membrane not contrasting 
with remainder of dorsum; face slightly blackened; underparts colored 
like dorsum. Body size large, specimens examined: Cuba: San 
German, Oriente Province, 1, USNM. Honduras: Rio Yeguare, 
between Tegucigalpa and Danli, 1, MCZ. Mexico: San Bartolome, 
Chiapas, 1, USNM; Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, 1, AMNH; Izamal, Yuca- 
tan, 5, USNM; Tekom, Yucatan, 1, CNHM; Matamoros, Tamaulipas, 
5, USNM. United States: Brownsville, Texas, 4, AMNH, 1, ANSP, 
3, CNHM, 49, USNM; Cameron County, Texas, 6, USNM; Padre 
Island, Texas, 1, USNM. 

Although geographic variation in coloration is considerable, geo- 
graphic variation in body size is not apparent in the small samples 
of ega that I have examined (see table 4, pp. 476-477). 

L. intermedins and floridanus must be closely related. Together 
they stand well apart from ega in larger body size, more massive skull, 
stronger rostrum, higher crests, and more widely spreading zygomata. 
Southern Texas and Latin American populations of intermedins average 
larger in body size than do specimens of floridanus from Louisiana, 
Georgia, and Florida, but they overlap. Neither this variation nor the 
variation in coloration appears to be clinal in intermedins and flori- 
danus. However, similarity of the antorbital structure in specimens 
from Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana, in contrast to this structure in 
specimens from Georgia and Florida, suggests gene flow between 
intermedins and floridanus. I have not seen specimens from Texas 
north of the Rio Grande Valley, where intergradation would be 
expected to occur if floridanus and intermedins are conspecific.

CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO, 
JAPAN 



By Lt. Col. Howard A. MacCord ' 



The present archeological field work was carried on during 1953-54 
as a part-time project. I was assisted at times by Japanese friends 
and hired laborers. The work was necessarily limited to the area of 
Hokkaido lying between the Ishikari River on the north, and the 
south coast of the island through the narrow isthmus known as the 
Ishikari Plain (see the map, fig. 1). This area of the island is the 
most heavily populated and the most accessible by road and railroad 
from the capital, Sapporo, where I lived and worked. The collec- 
tions made during these explorations have been given to the U.S. 
National Museum (Accession No. 209693). The 6-digit number 
that accompanies descriptions of artifacts is the Museum catalog 
number. Field notes and unpublished photographs have also been 
placed in the Museum. 

The explorations consisted mainly of reconnaissance trips to locate 
new sites and to visit known archeological sites in the area. In this 
work I was advised by two able and willing friends: Doctor S. Kodama, 
head of the Medical Department of Hokkaido University and an 
authority on Ainu physical anthropology; and Father Gerhardt 
Huber, German missionary-teacher and long-time student of the

Ainu people and Hokkaido in general. I take this opportunity to 
express again my deep appreciation to both these men for their many 
kindnesses and their valuable help. 

Ever since the opening of Japan to Westerners in the mid-1 800's, 
students have speculated about the identity and relationships of the 
Ainu people of northern Japan. Anthropologists who have studied 
them have arrived at no firm conclusions as to their nearest kin, their 
original home, or their prehistory. Among Japanese students the 
belief has long been current that the Ainu were the aborigines of 
Japan proper, and that they were forced northward to their present 
homes in Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuriles by the overwhelming 
power of the Japanese race — the Yamato people. 

The teaching of State Shintoism during the years between the 
Restoration (1868) and the end of World War II stressed the divine 
descent of the Japanese from the mythical deities, Izanagi and

Izanami. Nothing could be published that conflicted with this 
myth. In such a repressive atmosphere, no Japanese dared under- 
take the necessary research to identify the people of the shell mounds 
or to establish once and for all the identity of the Ainu. Since 1945 
archeological work by both Japanese and Westerners has begun to 
illuminate the problems and to hint at solutions. 

Archeological work in Hokkaido has been greatly neglected, though 
sites attributable to prehistoric cultures and to historic Ainu and 
Yamato occupancy are numerous. These sites comprise shell 
mounds, caves, stone "circles," earthen-walled enclosures, quarry 
workshops, groups of still-visible housepits, and many sites yielding 
both ceramic and nonceramic artifacts in topsoil of varying depths. 
Surface collections indicate occupancy of these sites during the entire 
range of the Jomon Period, as well as during the protohistoric and 
historic eras. Dates for these periods are unknown, but the Jomon 
Period is Japan's Neolithic Period and occurred possibly from 3000 
B.C. to A.D. 500, while the historic era begins about A.D. 1400. In 
addition, many sites yield only implements of flint and obsidian and 
may well be of preceramic age. 

Taniguchi Site 

The Taniguchi Site is on the left bank of the Ishikari River, 1 kilo- 
meter west of the town of Barato, 13 kilometers north of Sapporo. 
The site is at the northeastern tip of a sandy terrace that abuts on 
the river at this point, as well as at other points to the west. This 
sandy terrace is of uneven elevation and appears to have originated 
as beach dunes at some time in the geologic past, when the mouth of 
the Ishikari was near this point. The property is owned by Mr. 
Jinsaku Taniguchi, of Sapporo, who kindly consented to our making 
a limited excavation on the site. Since most of the site is occupied 
by houses, barns, and gardens of the Taniguchi homestead, no major 
excavation was made. A search of the fields and garden, however, 
revealed the extent of the refuse-strewn area to be about 2 acres. 
In a low swale adjacent to the houses the refuse appeared to be con- 
centrated, and this area was selected as the site for a test excavation 
5 meters square. The site map (fig. 2) shows the location of the 
tested area in relation to the houses. 

Surface materials found on the site consist of numerous cord- 
marked (Jomon) sherds, plentiful chips of obsidian and flint, and 
occasional finished implements such as projectile points, knives, 
scrapers, celts, and hammerstones. No bones, shells, or other 
organic materials were found. 

The excavations were begun on May 2, 1953, and completed on 
May 31, 1953. My assistants in this work were Messrs. Hatsuji

Takao, Yukie Kudo, Hichiro Ishibashi, and Isamu Shintani — all of 
Iwamizawa, Hokkaido. The area to be dug was staked in units of 
1 square meter, and each square was dug to hardpan in units of 
12K centimeters (5 inches). 

All material found in each layer and square was kept separate 
pending washing, sorting, and classifying. Hardpan under the black 
topsoil was a yellowish-brown sand, and any disturbances due to pits 
and postmolds were easily detected. Each square was carefully 
searched for such disturbances, and the few found were plotted on 
a sketch map of the excavation. Hardpan was usually reached at a 
depth of 80 centimeters, though two of the three pits reached depths 
of 130 centimeters. Pit outlines could not be discerned in the black 
topsoil, and we first became aware of the pits when hardpan was 
reached. Since the cultural material obtained in the excavation was 
practically uniform throughout, this failure to detect pit outlines at a 
higher level is not serious. 

At two places (squares 15 and 63) we found the remains of recent 
burials of infants. No bones remained, but the decayed wood and 
the nails, cleats, and handles of the coffins were identifiable. In one 
grave we found a mass of carbonized straw, as if this material had 
been used for packing the coffin. Also found in each grave were 
broken china dishes that date back to about 1900 A.D. Neither

grave exceeded a depth of 70 centimeters, and the tops of the coffins 
were just below the plowline. The finding of these graves, while 
having no bearing on the prehistoric nature of the site, is interesting 
archeological evidence of the disposal during recent times in Hokkaido 
of infant dead by burial as opposed to the more common cremation. 
An elderly local woman (possibly aged 70) witnessed the finding of 
the graves and claimed that she had not known previously of such 
graves in this garden. 

Throughout the squares excavated we found many sherds, chips, 
stone implements, fire-cracked stones, and flecks of charcoal. No 
restorable vessels were found, though enough sherds were obtained to 
show shape and approximate size of the pottery. Typical rimsherds 
found of Yoichi type (Middle Jomon Period) pottery are illustrated 
in plates 1 and 2. Careful sorting and comparisons of the pottery 
from each layer reveal no differences between that from the topsoil 
and that from the deepest layer. It had been hoped that some indi- 
cation of cultural change would be detectable in the material from 
such a deep site, but this hope did not materialize. 

A tabulation of ceramic traits from seven squares (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
13, and 14) that were least likely to have been disturbed by the pit 
excavations and by the recent graves is shown in table 1 above. The 
table reflects the strong cultural conservatism in the pottery, which is 
marked by the absence of change in surface treatment, design, shape, 
size, or firing. The only change noted is in the tempering material, 
which shows a gradual decrease in the use of fibers and pulverized 
obsidian from early to late and a corresponding increase in the use of 
grit other than obsidian (see table 2 above). 

Artifacts found in the 26 square meters consisted of the following: 

4000 sherds 1 perforated sherd, 3 cm. square 

204 scrapers 1 perforated pebble of chalcedony 

22 projectile points 1 partially perforated pendant? 

18 celts and fragments 5 tanged knives 

17 abrading stones 4 drills, chipped, obsidian 
2 chisels with polished blades 

The three pits found were of unknown use or purpose, and they con- 
tained no concentration of cultural materials. Their sizes and shapes 
are as follows:

Charcoal collected from the undisturbed portion of pit 1 below the 
hardpan level was given a Carbon-14 test by Dr. Meyer Rubin of the 



CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO MacCORD 487 

Low Level Radiation Laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey Ra- 
diocarbon Laboratory, and yielded an age of 3950 ±200 years (W-372). 
A comparison of the distribution of stone implements by depth 
shows no detectable differences in shape, size, or material used. Their 
types and distribution by depth are shown in table 3. They indicate 
an intense utilization of the locally available flints as well as obsidian 
brought from the valley of the Tokachi River, 100 miles to the east. 
Sandstone and pumice were used for abrasives, and several varieties 
of basaltic stones were employed in the manufacture of celts and 
chisels.

The celts found are all flattish and are either rectangular or oval in 
cross-section. All are small, 7 to 15 centimeters long and 5 to 8 
centimeters wide. A few celt "blanks" show that chipping usually 
preceded grinding in their manufacture. The chisels might bo con- 
sidered miniature celts, as their shape and materials are identical. 
The celts illustrated in plate 3a-d are typical. 

Projectile points (plate id-4) arc small, 18 to 60 millimeters in length, 
and were probably used to tip arrows. All are made of obsidian. 
The predominant shape has a long, pointed tang, sometimes longer 
than the main portion of the point. 

Knives (plate Se-h) and scrapers (plate Aa-c) were probably used 
interchangeably and are the most common tool at the site. Five of 
the knives are tanged, of which three are illustrated in plate Zj-h. 
Four of the flake scrapers seem to have been deliberately formed from 
large flakes (plate Aa-c), but the remainder are fortuitous flakes and 
spalls that show only slight secondary chipping. On a few is chipped 
a pointed tip for use as a graver or burin. 

The abrasives are irregular lumps of pumice or sandstone, though 
a few are worn through use into thin slabs. Two of the pumice 



488 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

abraders show rounded, grooved slots, as if they had been used to 
smooth a round object. Others are flat and may have been used to 
sharpen celts. One large, flattened boulder of quartzite has a con- 
cave depression on each flat side and apparently was used as a whet- 
stone for sharpening celts. 

Two stones found may have been intended for use as pendants. 
One is a pebble of chalcedony (411611) having a natural perforation, 
though there is some evidence of chipping around the hole. The 
other specimen is a flat, oval piece of basalt showing a partially drilled 
hole near one end (41 1570) . No effort had been expended on polishing 
or otherwise altering the pebbles. 

The pottery from the Taniguchi Site seems to be entirely homo- 
geneous ware of the Yoichi type, named after a small town some 30 
kilometers west of the Taniguchi Site where identical ware was found. 
The vessels are cylindrical, with flat bases, and with straight or slightly 
everted rims. The entire outer surfaces are usually corded, and in 
many instances the inner surfaces are corded for the top 3 or 4 centi- 
meters. Basal diameters range from 9 to 15 centimeters. Oral 
diameters are from 10 to 30 centimeters. The ware is usually from 
5 to 12 millimeters thick and is generally black or brown, though 
occasionally a red, yellow, or buff sherd is observed. Designs are 
common on the rim portions of the vessels. These consist of thick- 
ened and overlapping rims, added fillets of clay in various patterns, 
and various combinations of incised, punctate, and pseudocord designs. 
The rims illustrated in plates 1 and 2 show typical designs and 
combinations. 

Pottery of the Yoichi type is equated by Groot (1951, p. 54) with 
the wares of the Middle Jomon Period on Honshu. Similar pottery 
is found at numerous sites in Hokkaido. 

Ueiiae Site 

The Uenae Site is located on the right bank of the Bibi River, 9 
miles south of Chitose. The site lies on a prominent headland trun- 
cated by the Chitose-Tomakomai highway just west of the road 
leading to the Uenae railroad station. The site was found exposed in 
the roadcut resulting from highway construction. Since the entire 
region is buried under nearly 3 feet of geologically recent volcanic ash, 
no indications of the site show on the surface. Nearby Mount 
Tarumae, still smoldering today, is undoubtedly the source of the ash. 

The site appears to have been a small habitation area, since no 
extensive refuse is encountered, and the outcrop of cultural material 
is small. No bones or shells are present in the layers. A typical 
cross-section of the site is shown in figure 3. Since remains found in 



CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO AL\cCORD 



489 



the lower part of layer 3 are identical with those of the upper part of 
layer 5, the occupants of the site were probably the same before and 
after the volcanic activity that produced layer 4. No concentrations 
of refuse or other indications of hasty abandonment of the site were 
noted at the line of contact between layers 5 and 4. It is presumed 
therefore that the site was not occupied at the time of the eruption, 
but how long it had been abandoned is, of course, problematical. 

Due to the thickness of the overburden of ashes, no extensive 
excavation was undertaken. An area 5 feet by 15 feet was laid out

parallel to the edge of the roadcut and uncovered layer by layer down 
to hardpan. Layer 5 was removed in two equal increments, and all 
material found was kept separate for statistical comparisons. The 
blackness of the soil in layer 5 precluded our finding pit outlines until 
hardpan was reached. Here two small pits were easily detected. 
Pit 1 was 12 inches in diameter and extended 14 inches into the subsoil. 
It contained fire-cracked stones and a few sherds of Nopporo type. 
Pit 2 was 17 inches in diameter and 12 inches deep. This pit contained 
pottery of two types (Yoichi and Nopporo), fire-cracked stones, two 
broken and incomplete celts, two chipped scrapers, and charcoal, 
a sample of which was collected for Carbon-14 dating. The test by 
Dr. Meyer Kubin of the Low Level Radiation Laboratory of the U.S. 
Geological Survey yielded an age of 3230 ±160 years (W-322). 

The lower half of layer 5 yielded pottery of both Yoichi and Nopporo 
types, while the upper half yielded only Nopporo type sherds. No 
difference could be detected in the types of stone implements from 
the two zones. No postmolds were found in the excavated area, 
though they were carefully sought. 

Artifacts found include sherds, chipped and polished stone imple- 
ments, and one ornament made from a naturally perforated pebble of 
dark green material (plate 5c). The polished stone implements are 
limited to three broken and incomplete celts, one of which shows the 
scars of cutting on one side and illustrates the method used to detach 
the piece from a larger source. One lump of pumice has a groove on 
one side, the groove indicating use as a smoothing tool, possibly for 
dressing arrow shafts (plate 56). 

Chipped implements are arrowpoints, drills, scrapers, and knives. 
The material used is usually obsidian, though flint was also used. 
Arrowpoints (plate 5e-f) are small, either triangular, or with a small 
pointed tang. The drills and scrapers (plate 5d) are flakes and spalls, 
sometimes with only the slightest amount of secondary chipping. 
The knives are either large flakes with secondary chipping, or are 
specially made blades with a notched tang at one corner or on one 
end (plate 5a). 

The pottery of Yoichi type (plate Qa-b) is similar to that from the 
Taniguchi Site. The examples found show oral diameters of from 8 
to 15 inches, and wall thicknesses of from % to % inches. Designs are 
limited to run thickening and the addition of small lugs at rim level, 
but extend above the rim to form small crenelations (plate 6c). 

The majority of the ware from the Uenae Site is the Nopporo type 
(plate 6, c-e and g-h), which Groot (1951, p. 62) calls "Nohoro" and 
equates with the Omori type of the Tokyo region. According to 
Groot (p. 65), the Nohoro type is the probable ancestor of the Kame- 



CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO MacCORD 491 

gaoka type of the Final Jomon period in Hokkaido. The Nopporo 
ware found is thin-walled, % to % inches thick, and is uniformly of 
bowl shape. Bowls vary from 2 inches to over 12 inches in height. 
All are grit-tempered and flat-bottomed, and have slightly bulging 
sides and slightly incurved rims. No spouted bowls or other ornate 
forms were found. 

All the sherds are impressed with a cord-wrapped stick, with the 
finer cords predominating. Designs are limited to the rim and neck 
areas and include lines of fingertip impressions, lines of short, vertical 
slashes filling the space between horizontal incised lines, incised lines 
paralleling the rim, pseudocord lines paralleling the rim, geometric 
incised patterns, notched rimtops, and in two instances small rimtop 
enlargements bearing incised or notched designs. One strap handle 
covered by closely spaced cord impressions was found. Bases found 
are either plain or are cord marked. Plate 6, c-e and g-h, illustrates 
rimsherds of Nopporo type. Two restorable bowls have the following 
characteristics: 

Bowl 1 (411621) is 4% inches high with a plain base 4 inches in 
diameter. The rim is incurved and is 6% inches in diameter. The 
rimtop is round with thin, slanting incisions on the outer face of the 
rim. The sides of the bowl are finely cord marked, while design is 
limited to two incised lines parallel to and within % inch of the 
rimtop. The bowl is brown on all surfaces but in a few places is 
soot incrusted. 

Bowl 2 (411614) is identical in shape to bowl 1, but is only 3 inches 
high. The base is cord marked and is 4 inches in diameter. The 
rim is 7 inches across and is rounded and incurved. Design consists 
of three pseudocord lines parallel to the rim. The ware is brown 
with some soot incrustation. This bowl is illustrated in plate 6c. 

During the years required for the accumulation of the 14 inches of 
humus comprising layer 3, the pottery underwent considerable change. 
In the upper part of layer 3 was one sherd of Ebetsu type, with 
smooth surfaces and with thin ribbons of clay bearing closely spaced 
notches covering most of the lower part of the vase. For an illustra- 
tion of this type, see plate 8a. Also found in layer 3 was a small 
restorable vase (vessel 3, 411615) of smooth ware. This vase appears 
to be related to the Haji type of pottery of the Tanaka Site, described 
below, and of the Ogawara Pithouse Culture of northern Honshu, 
which is protohistoric. This vase is 2% inches high, with a basal 
diameter of 1% inches and an oral diameter of 3 inches. The sides 
expand from tho base to the rim, which is slightly flaring. No 
design is found on this vase, and the base is smooth, concave, and 
slightly flanged. The vase is illustrated in plate 6/.

Tanaka Site 

The Tanaka Site is located on the right bank of the Osatsu River, 
2 miles southwest of its confluence with the Chitose River. The 
site lies on a small peninsula formed by the juncture of a small, 
unnamed creek with Osatsu River. Elevation is about 30 feet above 
sea level, and about 10 feet above the level of the marshland border- 
ing the two watercourses. The peninsula is level, with gently slop- 
ing sides. The site is part of the farm of Mr. Sadaiichi Tanaka, 
whose house and barns cover portions of the occupied area. Mr. 
Tanaka reports finding sherds and stone tools in his excavations for 
potato cellars and other deep diggings. He cooperated wholeheart- 
edly in the plan to excavate on his land and deferred cultivation of 
the field until our work was completed. For this great kindness, I 
again express my sincere appreciation. 

Since the site had been covered with volcanic ash during relatively 
recent times, no artifacts were found on the surface. Four round, 
shallow depressions represent the locations of semisubterranean pit 
houses. The visible pits are about 30 feet in diameter, with a maxi- 
mum depth in the center of about 1 foot. Six additional pits are 
in a wooded area about 30 yards southwest of the Tanaka homestead. 
In another wooded area, about 200 yards east of the Tanaka Site, 
on the south bank of Osatsu River, is another group of 10 housepit 
depressions in an excellent state of preservation. According to a 
local informant, Ainu graves containing glass beads, iron swords, and 
similar articles of recent origin had been found when the area was 
cleared of trees in about 1920. Since the area has been cultivated 
repeatedly no evidence of the graves is now visible, and testing 
yielded no indication of graves. 

A test excavation 5 feet wide by 10 feet long was made in a por- 
tion of the Tanaka Site not showing a housepit, in order to determine 
normal soil conditions. This test revealed the layer of volcanic ash 
on the level surface to be 16 inches thick. Beneath this layer a stra- 
tum of black soil 20 inches thick was found overlying the brown clay 
subsoil resulting from the decomposition of earlier volcanic ash 
deposits. -"* 

Throughout the black stratum were scattered sherds, obsidian 
chips, and occasional stone tools. The sherds (411627) were identifi- 
able as representing several cultural periods: (1) Middle Jomon 
(Yoichi type pottery) ; (2) Later Jomon (Nopporo type) ; and (3) the 
Epi-Jomon with Ebetsu, Satsumon, and Haji-like wares, whose exact 
relationships have not yet been defined. Stone implements found 
are small triangular arrowpoints (411631), a broken celt (411630), 
and chipped flakes and spalls showing use as scrapers. 



CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO MacCORD

At the bottom of the black zone was a small oval hearth, 30 by 
26 inches across, identified by the reddish condition of the clay sub- 
soil. This reddening extended 3 inches into the clay. No concen- 
trations of sherds or other remains were found on or near the hearth, 
and no postmolds were noted in the tested area. 

One restorable vase of Haji type (411628) was found in the test 
trench. This vase is made of grit tempered clay, is brown, and is 
4K inches high. The base is 2 inches across and is plain and slightly 
concave. The ware is completely plain, though a line of vertical 
fingernail impressions parallels the rim )i inch from the lip. The rim 
top is pointed and slightly everted. 

A second vase (411629) found in the tested area is not restorable, 
but is a good example of a globular jar of the Ebetsu type. This jar 
is grit tempered and yellow. The rim diameter is 3 inches, while 
the base is 3% inches across. The base is plain. The upper half of 
the vase is covered by six bands, each % inch wide, of horizontal 
cord impressions, while the lower half is covered by similar marks 
running vertically. No design is found adjacent to the rim, which is 
square and slightly everted. Maximum diameter of the globular 
part of the jar is 6K inches. Overall height cannot be determined, 
due to the lack of essential parts, but it is in excess of 7 inches. 

Since it was decided to excavate two of the visible housepits, a 
base line was staked near the two depressions. This lino ran almost 
due north and south, with both housepits east of the base line. Fig- 
ure 4 shows the shape, size, and relationships of the two excavated 
housepits.

The southern housepit (No. 1) was excavated first. This pit was 
found to be nearly square, 25 by 25% feet. The floor was 36 
inches below the present ground level. Profiles of the north-south 
and east-west centerlines are shown in Figure 5. The partial filling 
of the pit with humus and the obliteration of the sides reveal that the 
housepit had been abandoned long before the ashfall now forming the 
surface of the ground. The ashfall was apparently wind driven, 
since the housepit received a thicker deposit than fell on the sur- 
rounding level surface. Cultivation of the surface of the ash has re- 
sulted in some intermixture of modern humus with the upper 1 foot 
of the ash. The cultivation of the field had also tended to level the 
housepit by dragging in ash and humus from surrounding elevations. 
A perfect, charred walnut found in the undisturbed ash layer indicates 
that the area was wooded when the ash fell, and the season of the 
year was probably fall or winter. 

A 3-foot wide trench was dug completely around house 1, thereby 
outlining the walls formed by the undisturbed subsoil. No artifacts 
were found in the recent humus or in the volcanic ash. However, in 
the black humus layer were found hundreds of sherds of both Jomon 
and Haji provenience. Among these sherds were one complete cup, 
one restorable vase, and three nonrestorable vases, numbered 1 to 5 
inclusive. Stone implements (411642) were few, but include 2 frag-

ments of celts, 2 projectile points (plate 7d), 2 drills or reamers 
(plate 7,c,e), and 17 chipped scrapers (plate la-b). The majority of 
the chipped implements are made of obsidian, though the presence of 
a few chips of flint show that this material was used. The celt frag- 
ments are small chips of polished diorite, too small to indicate the 
dimensions of the tool. One lump of sponge iron (411643, plate 7/) 
found in the humus seems to be contemporary with the housepit, 
but no other evidence of iron working was found in the excavation. 
Two postmolds found in the subsoil outside the housepit were vertical, 
and do not appear to have been part of the house structure.

Vessel 1 (411637) is an incomplete, nonrestorable bowl made of 
sandy clay containing many fiber casts. The paste is yellow and buff. 
It is a straight-sided bowl with a rounded bottom. The vessel is 
cordmarked over the entire outer surface. Height of the bowl is in 
excess of 8 inches. Rim diameter is 9 inches, while the base is about 
3 inches across. The rim is straight and pointed in cross-section. 
Short impressions of twisted cords are found on the inner edge of the 
rim. Perforations for repair are present on each side of a break in 
the side wall. 

Vessel 2 (411635) is a small vase-shaped cup 1% inches high. It 
is made of sandy clay and is unevenly fired. Basic color is a reddish 
orange, but black smoke clouding covers about one half of the sur- 
face. The base is subconoidal. Sides flare outward to a maximum 
diameter of 1% inches at a height of 1 inch. At the shoulder thus 
formed, the sides narrow abruptly to a nearly vertical neck ){ inch 
high. Rim diameter is 1 inch. The cup appears to have been 
molded over a fingertip. The outer surface is plain, though the 
neck is decorated with two parallel incised lines, which cut across a 
zigzag line to form equilateral triangles between the shoulder and the 
rim. The rim is straight and rounded in cross-section. 

Vessel 3 (411638) is a restorable bowl 5 inches high bearing at 
least two crenelations 1 inch higher. The shape is that of a wide- 
mouthed bowl with a flat bottom and straight, sloping sides. The 
paste is a sandy clay of yellow and buff color. The entire outer sur- 



496 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

face is cordmarked, as is the base and the upper % inch of the inner 
surface. The rim is straight and pointed in cross-section. The one 
crenelation present bears five rounded gashes. Rim diameter is 
8% inches, and the base is 3 inches across. Perforations for repair 
are present. 

Vessel 4 (411639) is an incomplete, nonrestorable vase at least 12 
inches high. Sides are straight and are nearly vertical. The oral diam- 
eter is 15 inches while the base is 4 inches across. The entire outer 
surface including the base is cord marked. The rim is straight and 
pointed in cross-section. No design is found, but the rim bears an 
unknown number of small (%-inch high) plain crenelations. Perfora- 
tions for repair are present. 

Vessel 5 (411634) (plate 86) is an incomplete, nonrestorable vase of 
the type known to Japanese archeologists as "Satsumon." Since the 
base is missing, the exact height and basal type cannot be deter- 
mined. Oral diameter is 10% inches, and the height is in excess of 10 
inches. The vase shows coil joints indicating the method of manu- 
facture. The paste is sandy clay, well fired, and yellow, buff, and 
brown in color, with some soot encrustation. Outer surfaces are 
plain, but show marks of having been scraped vertically with a rough- 
edged scraper. Maximum body diameter is 7 inches, with a slight 
constriction to 6% inches in the neck. The rim flares outward and 
then upward to a vertical, rounded rim. Design is found in two 
areas: the shoulder and the outer edge of the rim. On the shoulder 
are two discontinuous incised lines ){ inch apart. Immediately below 
the lower line is a row of ){ inch long gashes impressed into the clay 
at an angle of about 30 degrees from vertical, sloping from lower left 
to upper right. The design at the rim is a 1-inch band of three in- 
cised lines, spaced ){ inch apart with a row of gashes immediately 
below each line. The upper and lower gashes slope from lower left 
to upper right, while the center row slopes in opposite directions. 

Upon completion of the trench outlining the house, the house proper 
was completely cleared of ash and humus. As no trace was found 
of a doorway, the house must have been entered through the roof. 
A small burned area of the floor on the east side at the wall was un- 
doubtedly the hearth. It was connected with a collapsed structure 
of clay, which extended outside the housepit wall. The exact nature 
of this structure could not be determined, but it appears to have been 
either a smoke hole, or an air vent lined with clay. I found similar 
"chimneys" in house pits in the Anenuma-Ogawara area of Aomori 
Prefecture, Honshu (MacCord, 1955, pp. 150-151). 

Midway along the south wall, and 1 foot inside the edge of the 
house was a small rectangular pit of unknown use. It measured 10 
by 18 inches, was 6 inches deep, and was lined with small marsh 



CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO— MaCCOH I) 497 

reeds (Japanese-Yoshi), which had been converted into charcoal. 
No sherds were found in or near this small pit. 

At many places around the sides of the house lloor and at several 
places near the center were found charred wood representing fallen 
roof timbers. Four interior supporting posts for the roof were evi- 
denced by the postmolds equally spaced in the four corners of the 
pit. These molds were from 18 to 20 inches deep and were rounded 
on the bottom. The postholes were about 1 foot in diameter, while 
the actual post mold was only 5 to 6 inches thick. 

The location of the supporting posts and the orientation of the 
charred roof timbers indicate that the roof framing consisted of a 
square lintel connecting the tops of the four posts. The roof mem- 
bers were undoubtedly poles laid from the ground surface over the 
lintels and meeting in the center to form a four-sided pyramid. That 
this roof was covered with thatch is indicated by the presence of 
charred marsh reeds in quantity in the floor debris. 

Since so much of the roof structure has been converted to charcoal, 
it seems that the roof must have been covered with earth that smoth- 
ered the fire when the roof collapsed. The few Jomon Period sherds 
found in the pit (ill could have come from the earth used on the roof. 
The earth had probably been scraped up from the immediate vicinity 
of the house. No trace of a prepared floor was found, nor were there 
any sublloor storage pits or additional hearths. 

Cultural material found in the fdl of the housepit was not plentiful. 
Stone implements (411G4G) consist of three retouched flakes of 
obsidian, apparently used as scrapers. Two basal halves of vessels 
of the Haji type (411644), and nine miscellaneous sherds (411645) of 
the same type indicate the occupants of the house. Eight Jomon 
Period sherds of the Nopporo type were found scattered through the 
fill dirt. The two fragmentary Haji vessels are flat-bottomed vases 
with llaring sides. One base is 3 inches and the other &% inches in 
diameter. Both are marked with the impressions of a bamboo leaf, 
possibly Sasa palmata (identification by Dr. F. A. McClure, Depart- 
ment of Botany, U.S. National Museum). 

Apparently in the manufacture of the vases, the molded base of 
moist clay was placed on a section of leaf, and as coils were added to 
build the sidewalls, the leaf was turned, thus serving as a turntable, 
and possibly in imitation of the potters' wheel. The clay of the two 
fragmentary vases is a pale } r ellow with occasional blotches of red or 
brown, apparently representing firing inequalities. Temper in both 
vases is quart/ sand. Both vases are plain, though they show ver- 
tical marks of scraping of exterior surfaces and similar horizontal 
marks on inner surfaces. 

A sample of the charcoal found on the floor of house 1 was collected 
for Carbon-14 dating. Dr. Meyer Rubin of the Low Level Radiation

Laboratory of the U.S. Geological Survey obtained the age of 1100 
±160 years (W-419). 

A test trench 5 feet wide was dug from house 1 to house 2. This 
trench yielded no artifacts, but uncovering the subsoil revealed a 
shallow (24-inch deep) trench about halfway between the two houses, 
V-shaped in profile and running at right angles to the edge of the 
terrace. Due to insufficient time, this trench was not further ex- 
plored, but it appears to have been a drainage ditch designed to 
receive and carry away water running off the roofs of the houses, and 
possibly to lower the water table in the vicinity of the pit dwellings. 

The outlines of house 2 were traced by means of a trench similar to 
that around house 1 . In the trench were found one triangular arrow- 
point of obsidian (411649), six retouched flakes of obsidian, one of 
flint, and one of chalcedony (411650). Sherds found show the follow- 
ing distribution and varieties : 

Type 
Yoichi 
Nopporo 
Ebetsu 
Satsumon 
Haji 

One of the Satsumon rimsherds shows a support perforation just 
below the rim made before the pot was fired. 

House 2, like house 1, was roughly square but slightly larger. The 
sides measured 27.5, 28, 27.5, and 30 feet. The floor of the pit was 
36 inches from the present surface. No trace of a prepared floor was 
found, and no entrance way was visible. The fireplace was located 
on the south side, just west of center, and a collapsed clay extension 
outside the housepit wall was probably the remains of either an air 
vent or a smokehole. Three postmolds were found in the corners, 
but the fourth, if it existed, was missed. These postmolds were about 
1 foot in diameter and extended into the subsoil for 2 feet. No sub- 
floor pits or similar features were found. As in house 1, large quan- 
tities of charred roof members were found on the floor, and the floor 
show T ed reddening by fire in several large irregular areas. 

Artifacts found consisted of sherds and one obsidian flake scraper 
(411652). Sherds were found scattered throughout the fill, but one 
almost complete bowl was found at floor level only 2 feet from the 
hearth's edge. This bowl was found articulated, but was struck by a 
workman's shovel, and one piece was lost. Sherds of two other 
badly broken vessels were found concentrated in the southern half of 
the housepit, probably due to the proximity of the hearth. 

The miscellaneous sherds found in the housepit show the following 
distribution and varietv:

Vessel 1 from housepit 2 (411655) (plate 9) is an almost complete 
vase of Satsumon (j'pe. Since the base is missing, the exact height 
nnd base type cannot be determined. Overall height is in excess of 
7 inches. The vase lias expanding sides with a maximum diameter of 
5% inches, and a constricted neck having a diameter of 4 inches. 
The rim is strongly flared with an oral diameter of 5 inches. The 
paste is ellow clay containing a temper of fine quartz sand and minute 
flakes of obsidian. The exterior is plain except for vertical marks of 
scraping. No design is found on this vessel. 

Vessel 2 (411654) (plate 10a) is a small, shallow bowl made on n 
potters' wheel. The characteristic spiral striations on the base 
(plate 106) show the technique of severing with a cord the shaped 
bowl from the pedestal of clay from which the vessel was formed. 
The bowl is 2% inches high and has a Hat base and straight, expanding 
sides. Oral diameter is 4% inches while the base is 1% inches across. 
The clay is yellow and red. Tempering is primarily quartz sand. 
The use of a high-firing temperature is indicated by the glazed surface 
area roughly % inch square on one side. Since other vessels at the 
site were made by the coiling method, the bowl is probably an impor- 
tation, though from what source is not known. 

Vessel 3 (411651) is an incomplete shallow bowl apparently hand- 
molded. Height is \y 2 inches, oral diameter is 4 inches, and basal 
diameter is 1% inches. The clay is yellow with some areas of black 
clouding. The temper is quartz sand with some obsidian flakes. 

Miscellaneous Sites 

In addition to the excavations carried out at the Taniguchi, Uenae, 
and Tanaka Sites, surface collections were made at a number of other 
sites in the Ishikari Plain region of Hokkaido. These sites yielded 
materials representing most of the cultural periods of Hokkaido and 
supplementing the data obtained from the excavations. The fol- 
lowing brief descriptions of the sites and the materials collected at 
each are arranged according to a cultural sequence based on the 
excavations and on presumably parallel cultural evolution in other 
parts of Japan. 

Preceramic (?) Period 

One mile east of the city of Iwamizawa at a place called Higashi- 
Tonebetsu is a hilltop on which hundreds of obsidian and flint chips 



500 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

were found, as well as occasional perfect or broken artifacts of stone. 
No pottery was found, either on the site or in its immediate vicinity. 
This lack of pottery indicates that the site is a preceramic horizon 
or that the site is a workshop without adjacent habitation sites. 
Collection from the site consists of:

The celts and chisels are made from locally obtained boulders of 
glaucophane schist, or phyllite, both forms of metamorphosed shale 
(identified by Mr. James H. Benn, formerly of the U.S. National 
Museum). The obsidian is both of the speckled type and the plain 
type, which is translucent on thin edges. 

Early Jonion Period 

At Sunahama, located on the right bank of an abandoned channel of 
the Ishikari River, 1.8 miles west of Horomui, Ebetsu Township, is a 
small outcrop of cultural remains at a depth of 20 feet below the 
present surface of the flood plain. No excavations were undertaken, 
but a small collection consisting of sherds and two small triangular 
arrowpoints was made where these artifacts protruded from the 
deposit. The sherds appear to represent the cylindrical ware of the 
Early Jomon Period (Groot, 1951, p. 39). They are straight sided, 
flat bottomed, and cord marked over the entire outer surface. The 
paste is tempered with sand containing flakes of obsidian, and the 
ware is gritty to the touch. Designs occur only adjacent to the rim 
and consist of lines of pseudocord impressions parallel to and, rarely, 
at right angles to the lip. Rims are straight and rounded in cross- 
section, while six out of the seven rims show a notched rim top. 
Three sherds (411666) from this site are illustrated in plate I2a-c. 
The two arrowpoints found are of obsidian (411665). 

Middle Jomon Period 

One mile north of the town of Shimamatsu, on the road to Hiro- 
shima, is a small site lying on a hill just north of an unnamed creek 
that flows into the Shimamatsu River. Surface indications of occu- 
pancy occur over a 10-acre tract and consist of chips, artifacts, and 
an occasional sherd. All sherds are of the Yoichi type attributable 
to the Middle Jomon Period. Fragments of grooved mullers are 
plentiful. Artifacts collected are:

On the property of Mr. Matsushima Saichi at the highest point of 
(ho hill mass just cast of the town of Noboribetsu is a shellheap about 
150 feet in diameter. According to Mr. Saichi, it is about 5 feet (hick 
at the center and contains shells, bones, sherds, and earth mixed 
throughout. No excavation was undertaken, but a small surface 
collection was made. No sherds were collected, but the few seen 
appeared to be of the Middle Jomon Period. Stone artifacts collected

At Tsuishikari, 1 mile west of the town of Ebetsu is a sandy hill 
bordering tho Toyohira River just south of its confluence with the 
Ishikari River. This sandy emminence is probably part of an ancient 
sand-dune system. On this hill Japanese archeologists excavated 
many Ainu graves. These graves were not old, some being as recent 
as the middle of the 19th century. The graves yielded human bones 
in excellent condition, accompanied by iron swords and kettles, glass 
beads, brass wire ornaments, and other trinkets obtained by the 
Ainu from trade with the Japanese. In the topsoil between the 
graves and in some instances included in the backfill of the graves 
were found Jomon Period sherds and stone artifacts. During the 
present investigations, a 10-foot square test was dug to hardpan, 
but no graves or other features were met. In the topsoil of the test 
square and on the surface of the site were found the following:

In summing up, I must first express the hope that the findings 
reported herein will stimulate and challenge others to enter the field 
of Japanese archeology. Additional research in this hitherto almost 
unexplored area will, no doubt, produce results that will contribute 
much to our knowledge of the prehistory of the entire Far East and 
north Pacific region, including the Bering Strait approaches to North 
America. 

The stratigraphic evidence and the Carbon-14 dates from the three 
excavation sites demonstrate that Hokkaido has been the setting since 
at least 2000 B.C. for a sequence of cultures almost identical to that 
of Honshu. The many similarities in ceramics, stone implements, 
pit houses, and the hint of iron working at the Tanaka Site, as com- 
pared with the Ogawara Pit House Culture of northern Honshu, permit 
the conclusion that the people responsible for both sites were identical 
culturally and probably racially. Such a long time span with its 
numerous close parallels indicates frequent cultural contacts, if not 
actual migrations and intermarrying of the peoples of the two islands. 

The indications of a nonceramic period in Hokkaido, while not 
conclusive, hint of a far longer occupation there by man before 2000 
B.C. How much longer is unknown at this time. Recent finds on 
Honshu prove a preceramic occupation there, and more thorough 
search of Hokkaido may demonstrate a similar situation in the 
northern island. 



CULTURAL SEQUENCES IN HOKKAIDO MacCORD 503 

The stemmed arrowpoint illustrated in plate ISe is identical to 
many found in America, and Japanese archeologists refer to it as the 
"American Indian type." Such stemmed points of flint are more 
frequent in collections of stone implements from Sakhalin than from 
Hokkaido, and they are almost never seen in Honshu collections. This 
distributional pattern indicates a probable dispersion from a source 
common both to America and Japan -probably northeastern Siberia. 
This problem must await further search on the mainland before it can 
be solved. 

The identity of the people responsible for the Jomon Period materials 
and for the pro to historic Tanaka Site materials remains problematical 
at this time. I suspect that the people were of the same racial stock 
as the modern Japanese, but I cannot now prove this assumption. 

The role of the modern Ainu and his ancestors in this archeological 
picture is also still too obscure for any positive statement. The Ainu 
graves at Ebetsu and Hiroshima and those adjoining the Tanaka Site 
reportedly have yielded intact skeletal material and grave goods of 
such recency that they can with certainty be dated within the past 
century or so. 

During my explorations on Hokkaido 1 saw no archeological site 
that 1 could with certainty identify with prehistoric Ainu. Possibly 
the culture of the Ainu in early times was such that nothing but stone 
implements could survive. If so, this fact would account for the non- 
ceramic sites on Hokkaido. We must, however, await more thorough 
stratigraphies! explorations of the shell mounds, caves, and other sites 
on Hokkaido for answers to this puzzling problem.

NOCTUID MOTHS OF THE SCOPULEPES GROUP 
OF HEMEROPLANIS HUBNER 



ByE. L. Todd 



Three distinct species of the American genus Hemeroplanis Hiibner 
(family Noctuidae) have been confused in the literature and in collec- 
tions for more than 50 years, the specimens being identified as Hemero- 
planis scopulepes (Haworth) or as one or another of its s3monyms. 
Specific differences exist, however, in the legs and genitalia of the 
males and in the maculation of the wings of the females. These 
differences are discussed and illustrated in this paper. 

The three species — H. scopulepes (Haworth) (=H. pyralis Hiibner, 
the only originally included species, and therefore the type of the 
genus), H. aurora (Walker), and H. zayasi, new species — are treated 
herein as the scopulepes group. The males of the species of this group 
have the tibiae of the hindlegs modified — each is decurved toward 
the apex and bears prominent dorsal hair tufts — -while in the other 
species presently placed in the genus, the hindlegs are not so modified. 
In addition, in males of the scopulepes group (except males of the 
geometralis form of scopulepes) the coloration of the forewing basad 
of the postmedial line is some shade of j^ellow, 2 whereas in the other

species of Hemeroplanis the coloration of that portion of the forewing 
(or at least the median area of the wing) is some shade of brown or 
gray. Characters for group separation of the females, if existent, 
have not been recognized. Some of the females of the scopulepes 
group are colored as in the males, and may therefore be separated 
from females of other species of Hemeroplanis, but other females of 
this group are not so distinctly colored. 

Nothing is known of the immature stages or the larval food plants 
of either the scopulepes group or the other species presently placed 
in Hemeroplanis. 

A total of 127 specimens were available for study. Most were from 
the collections of the U.S. National Museum, but 25 specimens from 
the British Museum (Natural History) were sent by D. S. Fletcher, 
1 specimen of aurora was loaned by J. G. Franclemont from the collec- 
tion of the Department of Entomology, Cornell University, and 2 
specimens were received from the private collection of Fernando de 
Za3 r as Muiios of Havana, Cuba. Most of the line drawings were 
prepared by Arthur Cushman of the Entomology Research Division. 
The illustration of the genitalia of the tj^pe of aurora is presented 
through the courtesy of Mr. Fletcher. The adults illustrated on plate 
1 were photographed by J. R. Foy, Photographic Service Section, 
Photograph Division, Office of Information, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture.

Discussion: This species is extremely variable in maculation, so 
it is not surprising that the other two species, H. aurora (Walker) 
and H. zayasi new species, have been confused with it in collections. 
Typically the ground color of the basal and median parts of the wings 
is some shade of yellow while the terminal part is brown, but the 
ground color of the entire wing may be yellowish or some shade 
of brown. 

The name geometralis Grote (= Poaphila irrecta Walker) has 
been applied commonly to those specimens in which the entire 
upper surfaces of the wings are more or less suffused with some shade 
of brown. For many years these dark specimens were treated as 
a distinct species, but more recently they have been considered to be 
but a form or variety (not geographical) of scopulepes. It would ap- 
pear, judging from the dates on the labels of the specimens under 
examination, that the dark specimens represent the spring and/or 
winter (Florida) form. In the neotropical region this form appears 
to be uncommon, but it does occur occasionally. 

6 See footnote 4, p. 507. 



MOTHS OF THE SCOPULEPES GROUP — TODD 509 

Many of the specimens from the Antilles have the ground color 
entirely of some shade of yellow. There is no evidence at present, 
however, to indicate whether these pale specimens represent another 
seasonal form. If so, they probably should be named, but for the 
present I prefer to refer to them as "the pale form." Seitz 6 applied 
the name "pyraloides" to two figures of the pale form on plate 94, 
row e of volume 7, Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde [1940-46 ?]. 
H. pyraloides Hiibner should apply only to the typical form of 
sco pule pes. 

In addition to the characters indicated in the key, males of scopulepes 
may be recognized by the characteristic male genitalia (fig. G). 

Length of forewing: Male 11 to 16 mm.; female 12 to 16 mm. 

Type: The present location of the type of scopulepes is unknown. 
It has probably been lost. Ha worth described the species from a single 
specimen, obviously a male, in the collection of W. E. Leach via the 
Portland Museum. As the material from both the Haworth and 
Leach collections is now in the British Museum (Natural History), 
the type of this species should be in that institution, but Fletcher has 
been unable to locate it in that collection. 

Type locality: Haworth listed the type as occurring in England, 
"Habitat in Anglia rarissime." But he obviously believed that it was 
not a native species because he states in the description: "Antennae, 
pedesque desunt in exemplario D. Leach; at in peregrino (forte ex 
Americae Georgia) pedes postici praesingulares, subtus hirsutissimi 
et exacte scopulaeformes" (Antennae and legs absent in the example 
of Mr. Leach; but in the exotic (probably from Georgia of America) 
the very remarkable posterior legs very hairy underneath and pre- 
cisely scopuliform). Franclemont (1951, Proc. Ent. Soc. Washington, 
vol. 53, No. 2, p. 66) discusses other American species of moths that 
were described by Haworth and recorded as English species. 

Synoxymical notes: Hemcroplanis pyralis Hiibner, 1818: Type 
locality "Georgien in Florida." The excellent illustrations (figs. 127— 
128) leave no doubt as to the proper application of this name. Barnes 
and McDunnough (1918) were the first to place the name in the 
synonymy of scopulepes and I concur in that placement. The present 
location of the type of pyralis is unknown. It may be in the Natur- 
historisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. 

Ilemeroplanis pyraloides Hiibner, 1823: Hiibner proposed this name 
as a substitute for pyralis without explanation. The type is therefore 
ipso facto the type of pyralis. 

Scopelopus inops Stephens, 1829: Proposed as a replacement name 
for scopulaepes without explanation. The type is ipso facto the type 
of scopulepes. 

6 See footnote 4, p. 507. 



510 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

Poaphila irrecta Walker, 1865: Walker did not know the source 
or original locality of the specimen that he described under this name. 
Fletcher has examined the type in the British Museum (Natural 
History) and states in correspondence that it is a brown female of the 
form named geometralis by Grote. Therefore, if the brown form is 
to be recognized by the application of a form name, irrecta Walker 
would have priority. Smith (1893) treated this name as a synonym 
of pyralis Hiibner. 

Apicia denticulata Walker, 1866 : Type locality "Georgia." Fletcher 
has also examined the type of this species, likewise in the British 
Museum (Natural History) and has informed me that is it also a female 
of the brown form. I therefore place this name in the synonomy of 
scopulepes. 

Coptocnemia floccalis Zeller, 1872: Type locality "Texas." De- 
scribed from a single male stated to be in the "Cambridger Museum" 
(Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, Cambridge, 
Mass.). It is clear from the original description and illustrations that 
his name is a synonym of scopulepes, and it was treated by Smith 
(1891) as a synonym of H. pyralis Hiibner. 

Pleonectyptera geometralis Grote, 1872: Described from a single 
female from Central Alabama in June. Grote compared it with 
specimens of H. pyralis Hiibner taken at the same locality in July 
and stated that geometralis was "reddish fawn" to the postmedial lines. 
The type is in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences. 

Misspelling: Stephens (1829) inserted an "a" after the "1" and 
thus made the name "scopulaepes" and has been followed in this 
action by all subsequent writers. He did not discuss the change, but 
in any event I follow the original spelling, "scopulepes." On plate 
94 of Seitz (1940-46?) the specific name is spelled "scopelopes." 
Since the text referrable to this plate has not been published, the 
name, if an original proposal, has no status. 

Distribution: This species is known to occur from North Carolina 
(Raleigh) and Arkansas (Carrol County), through Central America, 
the Caribbean, and South America, to Argentina (Misiones), but it 
has not been reported from Puerto Rico. It was not present in a 
large collection of Noctuidae from that island recently studied by the 
author. The apparent absence of the species in Puerto Rico suggests 
that the species reached Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola from the 
north and the Lesser Antilles from the south.

Discussion: II. aurora (Walker) superficially resembles scopulepes, 
but the tibia of the middle leg of the males of aurora are greatly 
reduced, and the undersurface of the forewing docs not bear a tuft 
of hair as in scopulepes. Males of zayasi likewise differ in these two 
respects from scopulepes, but the basal tarsal segment of the middle 
leg is enlarged (nearly as wide as tibia) in zayasi and normal in 
aurora. The inner (posterior) spur of the middle leg is very long 
and slender (as long as basal tarsal segment) in aurora but only about 
half as long as basal tarsal segment in zayasi. 

The three specimens of aurora that have been studied exhibit some 
differences in maculation of the wings from scopulepes and zayasi, 
but three specimens represent such a small sample that it is not 
known whether the differences are constant and accordingly charac- 
teristic of the species. In the males the dark terminal marking of 
the forewing is only slightly darker than the median part of the wing; 
the basal edge of the marking is diffuse and poorly defined. The sub- 
terminal series of dark points is well developed, the spots nearest the 
inner margin largest. The apical part of the hindwing distad of post- 
medial band is suffused with salmon pink and has a subterminal series 
of dark points present. The female appears to differ from females of 
the other two species in that the postmedial band of the hindwing is 
nearly obsolescent. In both sexes the reniform spot of the forewing 
is nearly obsolescent, while in the other species, especially scopulepes, 
it is usually well developed. 

Length of forewing: Male 12 to 13 mm.; female 13 mm. 

The characteristic male and female genitalia are illustrated (fig. 5). 

Type: In the British Museum (Natural History), London, England. 

Type locality: "St. Domingo." 

Misidextification: This name was erroneously listed as a syn- 
onym of Hemeroplanis pyraloides Hubner, one of the synonyms of 
H. scopulepes (Haworth) by Druce (1890, Biologia Centrali-Ameri- 
cana, Insecta, Lepidoptera, Heterocera, vol. 1, pt. 85, p. 412). 

Distribution: Only five specimens of this species are known in 
collections, and they are all from Hispaniola. In addition to the 
type, there are three other specimens in the British Museum (Natural 
History), all with labels identical to those of the type. It has been 
possible, through the courtesy of Fletcher and the authorities of the 
British Museum (Natural History), to study a pair of these specimens. 
The other specimen of aurora, a male, is from Petionville, Haiti, 
May-June 1930, O. Fulda, and is from the collection of the Depart- 
ment of Entomology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. 

Remarks: The specimens illustrated (plate 1, figs. 7-8) are not 
so dark as the photographs indicate. The ground color is not darker 



514 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

than most specimens of scopulepes, the apparent darker ground 
color being the result of different lighting and other photographic 
techniques. Because of space limitations, the underside of the 
wings of aurora have not been figured. In the single female the 
maculation of the underside is similar to that of zayasi, but the 
maculation of the underside of the hindwings in the males agrees 
more closely with that of scopulepes in regard to the development of 
the transverse lines. 

Hemeroplanis zayasi, new species 
Figures 1, 4; Plate 1, Figures 1-3 

Description: Head with front only slightly exceeding eyes; front 
narrow, about equal in width to eye. Eyes moderately large, globoid, 
naked. Ocelli present. Antennae filiform, weakly ciliate ventrally. 
Labial palpi slightly oblique, nearly porrect, reaching about to middle 
of front, clothed with small, appressed salmon pink and dull brown, 
pale-tipped scales. 

Vestiture of front and patagia mostly of dull brown, pale-tipped 
scales, many bifid and hairlike. Vestiture of tegulae and thorax of 
yellow hairs over pale yellow scales. Abdomen yellow suffused with 
brown scaling. Large, white, lateral tufts of basal abdominal segment 
extending ventrad, covering abdominal sternites of basal segments. 

Legs of male with femora and tibiae conspicuously tufted (fig. 1), 
tufts mostly salmon pink except distal tuft of hind femur black. 
Tibia of middle leg short. Basal tarsal segment enlarged, densely 
scaled (fig. 1). 

Forewing about half again as long as wide (13:8); slightly falcate 
apically; termen weakly angulate at Cuij venation of quadrifid type, 
areole present in forewing. Maculation of wings as illustrated (pi. 1, 
figs. 1-3). Ground color of wings of male basad of postmedial band 
pale lemon yellow irrorated with brown, area distad of postmedial 
band rust brown. Ground color of wings of female variable, orangish- 
yellow, olivaceous or salmon brown, darker distally. Subterminal 
spot between Cu 2 and anal vein of forewing of male black; anal spot 
of hindwing of male salmon; elements of transverse band (when 
present) reniform and orbicular spots dull brown. 

Underside colored about as upperside, except ordinary spots and 
lines darker brown, and terminal area paler. 

Male and female genitalia specifically distinct (fig. 4). Uncus of 
male genitalia (fig. 4c) shorter and stouter than that of scopulepes 
but longer than that of aurora; apex of uncus membranous ventrally. 
Processes of inner face of valve larger and more heavily sclerotized in 
zayasi than in the other two species (see figs. 4a, 5a, and 6a). The 
aedeagus of zayasi shorter and stouter than that of scopulepes, longer

than that of aurora, the vesical plate differently shaped in all three 
species (figs. 46, 56, and 66). Female genitalia with ductus bursae 
shorter than in scopulepes and aurora and lacking a noticeable sclero- 
tized area near the ostium (figs. Ad, 5d, and Gd).

size and color of the subterminal spot between Cu 2 and anal vein in 
the forewing, the presence of the salmon-colored anal spot of the 
hindwing, and the more or less uniform ground color of the hindwing 
enable one to separate males of zayasi from males of the other known 
species of the scopulepes group.

LITHOGLYPTLS SPINATUS, A BURROWING 
BARNACLE FROM JAMAICA 



By Jack T. ToxMlinson and William A. Newman 1 



While in Jamaica in the spring of 1959, Stephen A. Wainwright of 
the Department of Zoology, University of California, collected spec- 
imens of the coral Acropora palmata containing the large burrowing 
barnacle, Lithotrya. At Berkeley we found associated with this bar- 
nacle a minute burrowing barnacle that has proved to be not only a 
new species, but a critical form in the taxonomic status of the families 
Chytraeidae and Berndtiidae of the order Acrothoracica. This Jamai- 
can acrothoracican has given us grounds for uniting these families 
with an older family, the Lithoglyptidae. 

The family Lithoglyptidae was established by Aurivillius in 1892 to 
accommodate three species of acrothoracicans: Lithoglypies indicus, 
ampulla, and bicornis. Utinomi (1950b) established a family, the 
Chytraeidae, in which he placed Lithoglyptes ampulla and bicornis 
(under the genus Chytraea). This classification was made because an 
adhesive disc was not mentioned in Aurivillius' description of these 
two species, and Utinomi believed that they attached to their burrows 
by means of their apertural hooks and spines.

California; the latter is a member of the Department of Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, 
California.

The species described here conforms to the diagnostic features of 
the family Lithoglyptidae, and except for certain specific differences 
it is very similar to "Chytraed" ampulla. This similarity extends to 
the details of the attachment area clearly illustrated by Aurivillius 
(1894) but disputed by Utinomi. The attachment disc in our form 
securely fastens the barnacle within its burrow. 

We therefore believe that Aurivillius did not place two barnacles 
without attachment discs in a genus and family that he described as 
having a disc whose function is attachment. "Chytraea" ampulla and 
bicornis clearly belong to the family Lithoglyptidae and to the genus 
Lithoglyptcs as originally described. 

Utinomi (1950b) described the family Berndtiidae to accommodate 
a new species, Berndtia purpurea Utinomi (1950a). This barnacle is a 
burrower that attaches by an adhesive disc. The diagnostic features of 
the new family were such that it was necessary for him to include Lith- 
oglyptes indicus in it. Since no particular diagnostic differences sepa- 
rate the Berndtiidae from the Lithoglyptidae and since the latter was 
described first, there is no justification for the family Berndtiidae. 
Thus, Lithoglyptes indicus and Berndtia purpurea, along with Litho- 
glyptes ampulla, Lithoglyjrtes bicornis, and the species described here, 
constitute the family Lithoglyptidae. Weltneria spinosa Berndt (1907) 
is placed incertae sedis in this family on the basis of its five pairs of 
terminal cirri. It appears to resemble Berndtia; however, the descrip- 
tion is incomplete.

Description: Female: Lithoglyptes spinatus is obovate in lateral 
aspect (fig. 1). Twelve adults had an average height of 1.92 mm. 
(range 1.30 to 2.84 mm.) as measured from the basal end to the middle 
of the rounded apertural hooks. The average width of 1.28 mm. 
(range 0.94 to 1.86 mm.) was obtained by measurements from the 
muscle attachment knob to the opposite side of the mantle. The 
barnacles are flattened laterally and average about 0.28 mm. in 
thickness. 

The mantle is provided with superficial bands of striated muscle 
radiating from the attachment knob, and from the basal area. There 
is no apparent musculature in the area of the aperture. Numerous 
small T-shaped teeth and short, stout spinules are scattered on the

surface of the mantle around the aperture and on the base of the hooks 
and spines. The remainder of the mantle is naked. 

The attachment disc adheres strongly to the burrow, and the 
barnacles are not readily removed until the coral is decalcified. From 
the base of a groove formed by the heavily reinforced ridges between 
the disc and the aperture, a small duct opens to the exterior from what 
is believed to be a cement gland. 

The average length of the slitlike aperture, based on 12 specimens, 
is 0.63 mm. Two large curved hooks are situated at the dorsal rim, 
and two large straight spines are situated near the ventral rim of the 
aperture. The hooks are essentially immovable while the spines, al- 
though not jointed along their length, have flexible basal attachments 
and can be opened outwardly in dead specimens from their usual 
position over the aperture. Comblike projections extend upward 
from both inside edges of the aperture and tend to occlude it. 

The pharynx leads dorsally from the mouth. The gut then bends 
posteriorly as an esophagus which leads to the long stomach. A 
supraesophageal ganglion is situated just dorsal to the esophagus. 
A pair of round digestive glands arise from the ventral side of the 
stomach and project anteriorly. An unpaired, thick-walled pocket 
near the anus may represent a rectal gland. The elongate anus opens 
between the paired terminal cirri on the dorsal side of the body. 

The mouth parts (figs. 5-7), composed of mandibles with palps and 
two pairs of maxillae, are typical for the genus. Each mandible has 
three strong, equally spaced teeth and numerous short spines and 
bristles on the cutting edge. The mandibular palp exceeds the 
mandible in length, and terminates in a tapering point; the edges bear 
a few long, soft bristles. Each first maxilla is armed with two strong 
teeth, numerous bristles and short teeth along the cutting edge, and 
is equipped with the usual apodeme. The second pair of maxillae 
are large and soft and have numerous flexible bristles distributed along 
their edges. These appendages are set close together and serve to 
cover the mouth field. 

The mouth cirri (fig. 8) have a 2-jointed pedicle upon which the two 
bristle-bearing rami articulate. They arise below the mouth parts 
and can extend up to the aperture of the mantle. They normally 
curve with the tips directed outward from the body. The anterior 
ramus has five segments, and the posterior ramus has four segments. 
All segments of the rami are equipped with numerous bristles arising 
with no particular symmetry. Many of the posterior bristles are 
hairy or feathery. 

There are four pairs of biramous, multisegmented terminal cirri. 
The articulations between the segments of the pedicles are slanted 
obliquely (fig. 9), a characteristic of the genus noted by Aurivillius 
(1892). The number of articles of the rami range from 30 to 50 



BURROWING BARNACLE — TOMLINSON AND NEWMAN 525 

(counts for one specimen), and increase in the posterior cirri. The 
rami are armed with long setae along their lesser curvature (fig. 10). 
The number and arrangement of these setae repeats itself on each 
article. A single seta occurs on every second to fifth articulation along 
the greater curvature of each terminal cirrus. 

The posterior end of the body supports a pair of uniramous caudal 
appendages of two distinct segments each (fig. 9). The proximal seg- 
ment bears a faint indentation suggesting a third articulation. The 
total length of the caudal appendage is about half the length of the 
pedicle of the posterior terminal cirrus. 

Male (fig. 4) : The degenerate male appears as a small simple sac 
with antennules for attachment. It is unique in that it possesses a 
stalk, often long and attenuated, between the antennules and the body 
proper. The stalk arises from a T-shaped connection with the two 
normal-appearing antennules and terminates in an annulated attach- 
ment to the body. The presence of a penis could not be confirmed. 
The male attached to the holotype female measured 0.91 mm. in over- 
all length, and 0.34 mm. in body length. Usually one male was re- 
covered in or near a pocket on the right side of the female (fig. 3) 
although two males attached to a single female were observed. 

Phylogeny: Of the known forms of the Lithoglyptidae, Lithoglyptes 
spinatus from Jamaica is most closely related to L. ampulla from the 
Java Sea. Both of these forms are superficially similar and both 
inhabit corals. L. spinatus can be separated from L. ampulla by its 
proportionately larger aperture, its more numerous small hooks and 
spinulcs on the surface of the mantle, and by the lesser number of 
articles composing the rami of the mouth cirri and the caudal append- 
ages. L. ampulla is twice as large as L. spinatus. 

Armor in the form of large apertural hooks and spines would appear 
to be a primitive characteristic in the Acrothoracica. The arrange- 
ment of these structures occurs in a strikingly similar pattern in certain 
members of the Lithoglyptidae, Balanodytidae, and the Kochlorinidae. 
It is highly unlikely that such similar patterns could have arisen inde- 
pendently from the more naked members of these groups. Further- 
more the most specialized (reduced) acrothoracicans have the most 
specialized habitats (e.g., Trypetesa within snail shells). The ability 
to attach by a disc and cement gland is also probably a primitive trait. 
The location and nature of this gland as seen in Lithoglyptes 
spinatus makes it highly probable that it is homologous to the cement 
gland and method of attachment seen in the thoracican Cirripedia. 
Acrothoracica without this gland should thus be considered as more 
highly modified forms. 

It follows then that the Lithoglyptidae is the most primitive family 
of the Acrothoracica because of the heavy armament, the possession of 
cement glands, the large number of terminal cirri, and the caudal 



526 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

appendage seen in most species. In contrast to these primitive 
characters, members of the family Lithoglyptidae lack the specialized 
lateral bar, gizzard, and long labrum characteristic of the family 
Cryptophialidae and the degenerate uniramous terminal cirri of the 
family Trypetesidae. 

Finally, it is interesting to note that Lithoglyptes spinatus from the 
Caribbean was found some 11,000 miles from other members of the 
family in the Indo-Pacifie.

NOTES ON MYSIDACEAN CRUSTACEANS 

OF THE GENUS LOP1IOGASTER 

IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM 



By O. S. Tattersall, D. Sc. 



The manuscript of U.S. National Museum Bulletin 201, "Review 
of the Mysidacea of the United States National Museum," by W. M. 
Tattersall, was completed in 1939 but, owing; to wartime restrictions, 
was not published until Oct. 4, 1951. During the intervening 12 
years, literature containing references relevant to Tattcrsall's work 
appeared and some systematic changes were introduced. The most 
important of these were contained in two beautiful "Dana Reports" 
(Xos. 19, 23) on the Lophogastrida collected by the Dana Expeditions 
(Fage, 1941; 1942). Of these two, only the second deals with the 
genus Lophogaster. 

Interchange of literature at the time was impossible and, although 
Tattersall, who died in 1943, was aware that a 1940 publication by 
Fage contained preliminary diagnoses of certain new species of the 
genus Lophogaster, he never saw it or the subsequent Dana Reports. 

When literature once more became available, it was evident that 
many amendments would have to be made to Tattcrsall's Bulletin 
201 in order to bring it up to date with the time of its publication.

528 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

To this end Professor A. H. Banner (1954) of the University of Hawaii 
compiled a concise and very careful supplement enumerating addi- 
tional records of known species and noting the foundation of new ones. 
Doubts concerning the systematics of any species arising as a result 
of these records were indicated, but their resolution was left until 
actual reexamination of the material could be carried out. 

In the 1942 Dana Report, Fage established certain new criteria 
whereby species of the genus Lophogaster could be distinguished, and 
instituted a number of new species based on these specific characters. 
Tattersall had also founded new species in this genus but in his descrip- 
tions and figures had not mentioned the characters that Fage regarded 
as of specific significance. 

As both workers dealt in some cases with material from the same 
localities, it seemed probable that some of the new species were 
synonymous. The question could only be answered by a reexamina- 
tion of the material in the collections with which Tattersall had 
worked. This reexamination I was recently privileged to make at 
the U.S. National Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, in Wash- 
ington, D.C. I wish to express my very great gratitude to Dr. 
Waldo L. Schmitt and to Dr. Fenner A. Chace, Jr., and his staff in 
the Division of Marine Invertebrates for all the help and kindness 
that they have given me during the course of this work and for all the 
facilities accorded me during my stay in Washington. 

By the great kindness of Dr. Elisabeth Deichmann, of the Museum 
of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., I have been allowed to 
examine paratypes of Lophogaster longirostris Faxon and have illus- 
trated from them those characters set forward as specific by Fage. 
The illustrations supplement the original description of this species. 

I am greatly indebted to Mr. Vernon E. Brock, Pacific Oceanic 
Fishery Investigations, for very kindly sending me material from 
Hawaiian waters for comparison with specimens in the collections of 
the U.S. National Museum. As a result, I am able to comment on 
Fage's species Lophogaster schmidti and to record it from the tropical 
central Pacific. 

It has not been possible to obtain the types of Lophogaster inter- 
medins Hansen, but I have examined specimens from the Mergui 
Archipelago, eastern Indian Ocean, which were referred to intermedins 
by Tattersall (1922), and have been able to compare them with the 
specimen from Albatross station 4944, referred doubtfully to this 
species by Tattersall (1951, p. 20).

Genus Lophogaster M. Sars 

Lophogaster M. Sars, 1857, p. 1G0. 
Ctenomysis Norman, 1862, p. 151. 

Remarks: The genus Lophogaster is so homogenous and its 
generic characters so clearly defined that it can readily be distinguished 
from closely related genera of the suborder. On the other hand, the 
separation of its species has always presented great difficulty to the 
taxonomist because of the slight differences in their specific characters 
and of individual variation that may occur. As a result, there has 
been much confusion in the records of members of this genus in the 
past. 

Differences between species lie not so much in the general form of 
the animals as in the degree of development of certain characters such 
as the length of the various spinous processes, the shape and relative 
length to breadth of the antenna! scale and the number of denticles on 
its outer margin, the proportions and armature of the telson, and the 
amount of tuberculation or spinulation of the integument of the 
carapace. 

Fage (1942, p. 5) noted that in most species of the genus, noticeable 
sexual differences occurred in some of these characters. Frequently 
the rostrum and sometimes other spinous processes became more 
elongated in larger females than in the males and young individuals. 
There is also a tendency for the number of spines arming the lateral 
margins of the telson to be greater in males than in females of the same 
species and for any tuberculation or spinulation of the carapace to be 
more pronounced in males. 

Fage (1940, 1942), when reporting on the very rich collections of 
this genus made by the Dana, noted two characters which proved to 
be much more constant, and therefore much more useful as taxonomic 
guides, than those hitherto used. These characters were (1) the form of 
what he termed the "antennular scale" * (the lamellar prolongation 
from the inner region of the distal margin of the third segment of the 
antennular peduncle) and (2) the dorsal profile, in lateral view, of the 
wings of the carapace together with the size and direction of the 
posterolateral or alar spines, when these were present. 

Specimens of Lophogaster have been recorded from various localities 
in all the tropical and warmer temperate waters of the world, including 
the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Fage noted that animals show- 
ing a correspondence in the form of their spinous processes, and 
in his new characters, sufficient to justify placing them in separate 

1 As this platelike prolongation is in no way homologous with the anti'nnal scale (which is the modified 
exopod of the antenna), it is perhaps eonfusing to call this structure a "scale." I have therefore used the 
word "lamina" for it throughout this work. 



530 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

species were almost invariably confined within circumscribed and 
isolated geographical regions. 

Investigation of the hydrography of these areas revealed that only 
very slight temperature variation occurred in them, and Fage sug- 
gested that this factor is the dominating one restricting the spread of 
the Lophogaster population. He advanced an interesting Irypothesis 
to explain the sporadic distribution of the members of the genus and 
the restriction of each to its own isolated locality in the world today. 
He suggested that these isolated species represent the survivors from 
an ancestral form which in earlier epochs was widely spread throughout 
the world. Owing to an inability to tolerate changes of temperature, 
this early form died out in those regions in which, owing to geological 
changes, considerable variations in temperature occurred. Only in 
isolated areas where the tsmperature remained relatively stable did 
remnants of the old stock survive and in their enforced isolation evolve 
those combinations of small differences whereby they may be separated 
into species today. 

There is much to commend this hypothesis. Certainly the geo- 
graphical distribution is a most valuable guide for the identification 
of species, though one or two cases are known of more than one species 
occurring in the same area. The correlation of distribution with areas 
which have a small range of temperature is most striking. Where 
there is a horizontal spread in the range of a species, this spread is 
usually associated with the flow of warm or cooler ocean currents. 

At the present time the genus includes 15 species, but the present 
research has convinced me that 2 of them are synonymous with 2 
previously described species. The 13 remaining species are distributed 
as follows : 

Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans 

1. L. lypicus M. Sars (1857): coastal waters of western Europe from 

southern Norway to the Bay of Biscay, west of Ireland;

2. L. subglaber Hansen (1927): south of Spain off Cadiz and Gibraltar. 

3. L. spinosus Ortmann (1906): tropical midsouth Atlantic and off

Remarks: This species was founded by Faxon on 20 specimens 
captured by the U.S. Coast Survey Steamer Blake in the Gulf of 
Mexico at 119 fathoms. The description, which I quote in full, is 
very brief: "Similar to L. typicus Sars but different in the great 
length of the medium spine of the rostrum which far surpasses the 
antennular peduncle and almost attains the tips of the antennal 
scales. There are 6 teeth along the outer edge of the antennal 
scale. Length 27 mm." The figure of the telson given by Faxon 
shows seven lateral spines on each lateral margin in addition to the 
long apical spine. 

Ortmann (1906), when reporting on collections of Lophogaster from 
nine stations in the western Atlantic (three from the Gulf of Mexico, 
three oil' Key West, and three from off the coasts of the Carolinas), 
commented on the length of the rostrum and the variation displayed 
in the number of teeth arming the outer margin of the antennal 
scale and of the spines on the lah ral margins of the telson. Because 
of much individual variation in these characters, he decided that they 
had no specific value and referred all the specimens to L. typicus. 

Tattersall (1951) separated the Lophogaster material of the western 
Atlantic into two species: (1) longirostris, for those specimens occurring 
in the Caribbean atid the Gulf of Mexico, and (2) a new species, 
americanus, for those taken off Key West and along the path of the 
Gulf Stream as far as the southern part of Massachusetts. In describ- 
ing his new species, he enumerated the characters distinguishing it 
from /.. typicus and especially stressed the fact that the integument 
of the carapace was minutely spinulose, but he made no detailed 
comparison between it and longirostris.

In reexamining the considerable numbers of specimens at pre- 
sent referred to these two species in the collections of the U.S. 
National Museum, I have failed to find any really constant characters 
upon which they can be separated. The form of the antennular 
lamina is almost precisely the same in all (fig. I, a J); the spinulation 
of the carapace is extremely difficult to make out and in a few instances 
does not correspond with the geographical distribution of the species 
as laid down by Tattersall. For instance, specimens from station

2403 (in the Gulf of Mexico) arc spinulose; on the other hand, I have 
been unable to find any trace of spinules on the integument in speci- 
mens from station 2314 (between Charleston and Savannab) and 
station 2418 (between Cape Charles and Savannah). 

This character is not very satisfactory for specific purposes, for not 
onl}?- is it very difficult to see, but it varies with the size and maturity 
of the individual, the variance being more pronounced in the smaller 
forms. At some stations where several animals were taken in a haul, 
I found some spinulose and others apparently quite smooth. 

The variation in the armature of the telson throughout the collec- 
tions was most noticeable. Faxon's type of longirostris has seven 
lateral spines including the subapical ones on each side. In the 
paratypes, I found usually four, but in two cases there was an addi- 
tional notch that might indicate a fifth spine lost or in the process 
of development. TattersalPs type of americanus had five, but in 
material from other stations identified as americanus by Tattersall 
and as typicus by Ortmann there are almost invariably four on each 
side including the subapical one. 

After close examination of all the available material, I am of the 
opinion that there are insufficient grounds for the separation of 
americanus and that it should be regarded as a synonym of longirostris, 
whose description should be amplified as follows: 

Carapace, integument smooth or more or less sparsely beset with 
microscopic, forwardly directed spinules, especially in the dorsal 
anterior region; rostral plate broadly tridentate with the central spine 
produced into a long acute rostrum extending beyond the antennular 
peduncle (rarely slightly shorter) but not extending to the tips of the 
antcnnal scales; usually relatively longer in the female; posterolateral 
angles produced into rather short acute spines. 

Antennular lamina well developed with inner margin usually 
st raight, armed with a close row of long, very fine setae and terminating 
in a strong tooth which extends very slightly beyond the apex; apex 
rounded, armed with a regular row of small spinules (fig. \,aj). 

Antenna! scale of the rotundate type but less broad than in typicus; 
outer margin armed throughout its length with from 6-8 strong 
teeth; apex acutely pointed, straight or very slightly incurved (fig. lc). 

Tergal spines from the last abdominal somite long and acutely 
pointed; from one-ninth to one-seventh as long as tho telson. 

Telson with lateral margins armed with 4-7 slender spines including 
the subapical pair; apical spines very long (may be as much as one- 
fourth of the telson in length) flanking a small apical plate bearing 
5-8 small spinules (fig. l,b,e,h).

Lophogaster intermedins Hansen, 1910, p. 14, figs. — W. M. Tattersall, 1922, p. 448 
(not W. M. Tattersall, 1951, p. 20, as L. intermedins ?). 

Remarks: This species was founded by Hansen on specimens 
captured by the Siboga Expedition in the waters of the Dutch East 
Indies. It has unfortunately not been possible to examine the types 
of the species. A number of specimens from the Mergui Archipelago 
referred to L. intermedins (Tattersall, 1922, p. 448), however, agree 
so closely with Hansen's description and figures of this species that 
there can be little doubt as to the correctness of their identification. 
For the purpose of comparison, a figure showing the salient features 
of these specimens is given herewith (fig. 2.) 

Tattersall (1951, p. 20) doubtfully referred an adult ovigerous 
female from station 4944 off the south east of Japan to L. intermedium 
and pointed out at the same time its close resemblance to other 
specimens from Japanese waters. He added that it might be merely 
a variety of his new species L. japonicus (=L. pacijicus Fage). With 
this suggestion I concur, and I discuss characters and individual 
differences below under L. pacijicus (fig. 3). I have examined a 
single specimen from station 4101 off Kauai, Hawaiian Islands, and 
find that it conforms very closely with the description and figures 
of L. hawaiensis (especially in the form of the antennular lamina). 
I suggest that it should be referred to this species. If I am correct in 
my interpretation of the identity of these two specimens, it will mean 
that L. intermedins is not represented in the collections of the U.S. 
National Museum.

Remarks: Fage (1942, p. 29) founded the species L. pacifieus on 
two nearly adult female specimens captured by the Dana in the 
China Seas to the north of Formosa. He mentioned that specimens 
from Japanese waters referred by Ortmann (1906) to L. typicus 
agreed in all respects with this new species except that there were 
fewer teeth arming the outer margin of the antennal scale — only 
three compared with the five to sLx in his types of pacijicus. 

One of the most outstanding characters of both pacijicus and typicus 
is the presence of thickly scattered coarse tubercles on the carapace. 
In addition there is in typicus a strong, very noticeable, forwardly

directed spine on each side posterior to the eye and just in front of 
the cervical sulcus. In pacificus this spine is replaced by a thick 
blunt protuberance. 

Curiously, Ortmann made no reference to these characters when 
recording the Japanese specimens. A reexamination of his specimens 
reveals, however, that in these characters they agree precisely witli 
L. pacificus, and Fage himself stated that they belong to this species. 

Tattersall (1951) founded anew species, L. japonicus, on specimens 
captured by the Albatross in 1906 off the south of Japan and, at the 
same time, expressed the opinion that the Japanese specimens referred 
by Ortmann (1906) to L. typicus should be referred to it. The types 
of japonicus agree in every detail with Ortmann's material including 
tho presence of only three teeth (or in one case oidy two) on the outer 
margin of the antenna! scale. 

After very close examination of all the material of japonicus in the 
collections of the U.S. National Museum — amounting to 13 cf and 
7 9 (3 ovigerous) — I can find no other constant point of difference 
between these specimens from Japanese waters and the description 
and figures given by Fage of his types of L. pacificus. Since in other 
species of the genus the number of teeth arming the antenna! scale 
is somewhat variable, I think that L. japonicus should be referred 
to the synonymy of L. pacificus. 

In his description of L. pacificus, Fage did not mention any armature 
on the lobe from the anterior margin of the antennular peduncle. 
He simply stated, as one of the characters of the species, "ecaile 
antennulaire largement deprimee an bord anterieur."

Lophoqaster typicus, Ortmann, 1905, p. 967; 190G, p. 23 (Hawaiian specimens only). 

Occurrence: Albatross stations 3847, 3857, 3858, 3884, and 4101 
situated in coastal waters around the Hawaiian Islands; two specimens 
taken at 43 m. but the remainder around 250 in. in depth. 

Remarks: This species very closely resembles L. intermedins in 
the presence of minute scattered nodules or microscopic blunt spinules 
on the carapace, in the length and shape of the rostrum, and in the 
shape and armature of the telson. It can be distinguished from 
intermedins by its relatively broader antennal scale with its somewhat 
convex outer margin and much more convex inner margin, by the 
characteristic concave anterior margin of the antennular lamina, and, 
if the specimens from the Mergui Archipelago can be taken as true 
intermedins, by the shorter and stouter alar spines.

It differs sharply from pacijicus in lacking coarse tubercles on the 
carapace and in the complete absence of any postorbital spines or blunt 
processes, in the relatively shorter rostrum, in the shape of the anterior 
margin of the antennular lamina (figs. 3a and 4a) , in the smaller hori- 
zontal alar spines, and in the presence of only one pair of spines on the 
lateral margins of the telson in addition to the subapical and apical 
spines. 

In intermedins, pacijicus, and hawaiensis the tergal spines from the 
last abdominal somite are almost obsolete.

A specimen in the collection from station 4101 and labelled L. inter- 
medins resembles other specimens from this station so closely in all 
respects that it should be referred with them to L. haivaiensis. 
Most of the specimens in the collection are juvenile, but in those 
sufficiently mature for their sex to be ascertained, the rostrum is 
not invariably longer in the females than in the males. Possibly, 
this character develops only with maturity.

pp. 44^45, figs. 

Occurrence: Station 3: cruise 32 of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Re- 
search Vessel Hugh M. Smith, 21°0' N., 157°54' W., Feb. 2, 1956 
(night); Isaac-Kidd trawl, oblique haul approximately 500 m., 1 
immature 9, 10 mm. Station 9: cruise 30 of R/V Hugh M. Smith, 
26°09' N., 167°17' W., Aug. 19, 1955 (night); Isaac-Kidd trawl, 
oblique haul approximately 550 m., 2 adult d\ 20-25 mm., 1 imma- 
ture d\ 18.5 mm (damaged), 1 ovigerous 9, 15.5 mm., 2 immature 
9, 14 and 15 mm. 

Remarks: These specimens agree remarkably closely with the 
published descriptions and figures of L. schmidti as follows: 

The integument is quite smooth with no trace of spinulcs. 

The rostral plate is rather narrow with the central spine long and 
slender; it extends in the males beyond the anterior margin of the 
antcnnular lamina and in the females to the level of the distal tips 
of the antennal scale (fig. 5a). 

The eyes are comparatively small and are almost covered by the 
rostral plate in dorsal view exactly as in Fage's figure (fig. 5a). 

The antennal scale is exactly similar in shape and proportions, 
but on the whole there are fewer teeth on the outer margin. One 
adult male and the ovigerous female had three-three and three-four 
respectivel}*; one male had four-four; two immature females had 
four-five; and the small female from station 3 had five on one scale 
and six on the other. This character is evidently variable (fig. 5c.) 

The profile of the dorsal margins of the "wings" of the carapace 
is evenly concave; the alar spines are long and slender and only 
slightly, if at all, directed upward (fig. 5d). 

The tergal spines of the last abdominal somite are unusuallv long 
(fig. 56). 

The telson is long and narrow, nearly five times as long as its 
greatest width. Each lateral margin bears three extremely small 
spines in addition to the subapical spines that are themselves very

small and slender. Apical spines are long and strong. The apical 
plate is not produced at all and is armed with 9-13 spinules, which 
are usually uneven in size and consist of somewhat larger ones alter- 
nating with smaller ones in the spaces between them (fig. 5/). 

In some of the specimens the proximal spine on each lateral margin 
is so small that only by the slight indentation of the margin at the 
point of its origin can one be led to see it. Fage mentioned a similar 
condition in his description of the types of L. schmidti. 

These Hawaiian specimens are somewhat smaller than the tj'pes 
and paratypes collected by the Dana. The one ovigerous female in 
this collection was carrying advanced embryos, but it measures only 
15 mm., whereas those of the Dana were from 17-20 mm. in length. 
Apart from this slight difference, the present specimens differ in only 
one character from the full description given by Fage (1942, p. 35) — 
the form of the lamina from the antennular peduncle. He made a 
strong point of the fact that in all his specimens the anterior margin 
of this lamina was evenly rounded and without teeth or spinules. 
The only armature he figured was a single slender simple seta in the 
middle of the apex. In all the Hawaiian specimens the inner margin 
ends in a strong tooth. The tooth is separated by a small concavity 
from the rounded apex, which extends only very slightly beyond it. 
From three to five very minute notches can be made out on the inner 
half of the apex, but the other half and the whole of the outer margin 
are completely smooth. In the immature specimens the inner margin 
and the inner half of the apex are adorned with a few regular very fine 
setae. It may be that the small notches seen on the margins of the 
older specimens indicate the positions from which setae had arisen and 
have subsequently been lost. 

Fage considered that the form of the antennular laminae was of 
specific importance but, though differing in this particular character, 
the present specimens agree so very closely with L. schmidti in all 
other characters that they should be referred to this species. It may 
be that they represent a geographical race of L. schmidti. 

If my diagnosis is correct, the geographical range of this species 
is considerably extended northward and eastward. The captures off 
Hawaii were made in precisely the same conditions as the captures 
from north and west of New Guinea (Fage) and the western Arabian 
Sea (O. S. Tattersall) — that is, the animals were pelagic in depths of 
not more than 550 m. from the surface over much greater depths. 
Possibly the species is widely distributed in similar conditions through- 
out the tropical Pacific. 

The adult female described below as Lophogaster sp. B closely re- 
sembles schmidti in the form of the rostral plate, the length of the 
alar spines, and the armature of the lateral margins of the telson. 



542 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

It differs in the armature of the antermular lamina, the shape of the 
antennal scale, the upward inclination of the alar spines, the fewer 
spinules arming the apex of the telson, and above all in the short 
poorly developed tergal spines from the last abdominal somite (fig. 
7,«,/). 

Lophogaster sp. A 

Figure 6 
Lophogaster sp. ? W. M. Tattersall, 1951, p. 20, fig. Id. 

Occurrence: Albatross station 4891, Ose Saki Light, Eastern 
Seas, 32°27' N., 128°34' W., 1 <?, 20 mm. 

Description: Tattersall (1951, p. 20) gave a brief description with 
a figure of the antennal scale of a single male specimen of Lophogaster 
captured by the Albatross off the south of Japan. The following- 
supplementary description can now be given : 

Carapace with the three spines of the frontal plate equal in length, 
lateral ones slightly incurved; posterolateral angles produced into 
short acute spines (fig. 6c). 

Antennular lamina well developed; extending forward almost to the 
level of the apex of the antennal scale; inner margin slightly convex, 
armed with fine plumose setae and terminating in a very small tooth; 
anterior margin rounded, extending noticeably beyond the level of 
the tooth; margin finely crenate (fig. Q,a,b). 

Tergal spines of the last abdominal somite very long and acutely 
pointed; about one-eighth of the telson in length (fig. 6d). 

Telson with lateral margins armed with four very small spines and 
a pair of long slender subapical spines. The tips of both apical spines 
are broken off, but from what is left it is evident that they must have 
been very long. Apical plate short and broad, armed with eight 
spinules of which the median pair are extremely minute; a fine plu- 
mose seta arises on each side between the outermost spinule and the 
next (figs. 6,d,e). 

Remarks: In the form of the frontal plate, the shape of the antennal 
scale and the armature of the telson, this specimen resembles L. typicus 
but can at once be distinguished from it by the absence of tubercles 
and postorbital spines on the carapace, by the form of the anterior 
margins of the antennular laminae, by the well developed alar spines, 
and by the very long acute spines of the last abdominal somite. 

It differs from the other Pacific species, pacificus, intermedins, and 
hawaiensis, in the shortness of the rostrum, in the rounded crenate 
anterior margin of the antennular lamina, in the small alar spines, 
in the long acute tergal spines; in the larger number of spines arming 
the lateral margins of the telson, and in the form and arrangement 
of the apical spinules (fig. 6e).

544 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

The specimen shows some points of resemblance to L. multispinosus 
but differs in the somewhat shorter rostrum, in the rounded apex of 
the antennular lamina and, principally, in the relatively shorter and 
broader telson with the fewer lateral spines, and in the long slender 
subapical spines. Fage does not mention the form of the apical plate, 
but in his figure there are six spinules of equal size which are longer 
than any of those in the present specimen. 

There seems to be no doubt that this specimen represents a new 
species; however, as it may not be fully mature and considerable 
changes may occur with growth, naming it would be unwise until more 
material is available. 

Lophogaster sp. B 

Figure 7 

Occukrence: Albatross station 3965, vicinity of Laysan Island, 
Hawaii, 1 adult 9 with fully developed but empty brood sac, 27 mm. 

Description: Carapace with integument very sparsely beset with 
minute spinules; frontal plate rather broad; rostrum long, extending 
considerably beyond the antennular peduncle to the level of the tips 
of the antennal scales; wings with the ventral margin less convex 
than in other Pacific species; alar spines very long and acutely pointed, 
inclined obliquely upward in lateral view (fig. 7,a,d). 

Antennular lamina with inner margin slightly convex, setose and 
terminating in a short, strong tooth; anterior margin convex, its 
apex barely extending beyond the tooth; armed with a regular row of 
minute spinules; apophyses from dorsal surface of peduncle unequal 
in size (fig. 76). 

Antennal scale twice as long as its greatest width, which occurs 
at about one-fifth of its length from its base and then tapers to a 
long acute apex; outer margin straight, armed with four teeth with 
a trace of a fifth (fig. 7c). 

Tergal spines of the last abdominal somite small but well developed, 
acutely pointed (fig. 7e). 

Telson less than three times as long as its greatest width; lateral 
margins armed with three small spines on each side in addition 
to the relatively small subapical spines; apical spines broken but 
appear from what remains to have been long and slender; apical 
plate not at all produced, armed with five regular spinules and two 
plumose setae (fig. 7,e,f). 

Remarks: This specimen was referred by Ortmann (1905; 1906) to 
L. typicus in company with a number of specimens from five other 
stations around Hawaii (.3847, 3857, 3858, 3884, and 4101). Fage 
(1940) founded a new species, L. hawaiensis, for these specimens, and W. 
M. Tattersall (1951, p. 252), not having access to Fage's paper, briefly 
referred all specimens from Hawaiian waters to Fage's species. He

546 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

noted that further examination of the material should be made when 
Fage's description became available. 

Critical examination proves that all the specimens in the collections 
of the U.S. National Museum from Hawaiian waters, with the excep- 
tion of the adult 9 from station 3965, can without question be referred 
to hawaiensis. In every case the form of the antennular lamina and 
antennal scale, the shape and size of the alar spines, the almost 
complete absence of tergal processes from the last abdominal somite, 
and the armature of the telson are most consistent. 

The specimen from station 3965, however, differs from hawaiensis 
as follows: 

The rostrum is relatively much longer, the alar spines are very 
considerably longer, and the tergal spines (which are practically 
obsolete in hawaiensis) are well developed, though small. 

The anterior margin of the antennular lamina has a tooth on its 
inner angle, separated by a small concavity from a rounded apex 
adorned with spinules, whereas in hawaiensis this margin is deeply 
concave and unadorned with spinules. 

The antennal scale is longer and more slender and its outer margin 
is straight. 

The telson is armed with three small spines on each side and a very 
short subapical spine, while in hawaiensis there is only one lateral 
spine in addition to the subapical one. 

I am therefore unable to place this specimen into any of the known 
species and consider that in all probability it represents a new form, 
but since the genus exhibits so much individual variation, it would 
be unwise to found a new species on a single imperfect individual.

The following description of a fairy shrimp belonging to the genus 
Branchinecta is the result of the study of 33 collections from 9 diff- 
erent localities, made between 1937 and 1958. The data contained 
in the specific diagnosis are based on observation and measurements 
of 20 mature specimens of each sex.

drical proximally, but expanding to a widened distal part which extends 
about 60 percent of its length, and which is approximately 4 times as 
wide as thick, slightly concave on its lateral side, with the narrower 
borders anterior and posterior. Near the apex the article contracts 
a little, then expands into a tip flattened nearly at right angles to the 
preceding part. In end view, the tip appears like a heel and toe, 
the more pointed toe being median. A rasplike area of low-flat- 
topped, chitinized papillae on the posterolateral side of the tip extends 
about halfway up the lateral border. Thoracic appendages typical 
of the genus; branchial lamina entire with serrated margin; the 
endopodite tapering to a slightly inturned end, with characteristic 
spines on its median border. Genital segments and copulatory 
appendages typical of the genus. Cercopods 1.5 (0.85-2.5) mm. 
long, distinctly articulated with the telson, with long, plumose setae 
on lateral and median borders. 

Female: Length from front to end of cercopods 23 (18.75-30.0) 
mm. Ratio of length of head-thorax to that of genital segments, 
abdomen, and cercopods 1:1.33 (1:1.2-1:1.5). Antennule 1.9 (1.75- 
2.25) mm. long, about the same length as the antenna. Antenna 
1.97 (1.4-3.5) mm. long, uniarticulate, the distal fifth narrowing to 
a tapering point. The 1 1 thoracic segments each bear a pair of 
dorsal verrucose bosses of conspicuous size, which may or may not 
bear sensor} 7 bristles; those of segments 4 and 9 nearer the middorsal 
line than the others. Thoracic appendages typical of the genus, 
the endopodite more obtuse than that of the male, with food-trapping 
spines of simpler spinulescence. Ovisac narrow anteriorly, expanding 
at the level of the second abdominal segment to from 2){ to 4 times its 
anterior width to form right and left conical outpocketings, then 
contracting to about 65 percent of its maximum width to continue 
to a bluntly conical posterior end located under abdominal segment 
4 or 5. Eggs of preserved specimens 295-345 microns in diameter. 
Cement glands composed of right and left, closely apposed, masses 
of large cells at the anterior end of the ovisac and on the dorsolateral 
sides of the posterior half of the uterus. Cercopods 1.36 (1.0-1.75) 
mm. long, with long, plumose setae on median and lateral borders. 

The smallest mature female encountered was 12 mm. long, with 
2 eggs in the ovisac, which extended only as far as the middle of the 
third abdominal segment. 

Type data: One female holotype, USNM 104128, and 12 male 
and 12 female paratypes, USNM 104129, have been deposited in 
the U.S. National Museum. The type locality is an alkaline pond 12 
miles south of the town of Moses Lake, Grant County, Washington. 

Differentiating characters: The males are morphologically 
very close to B. mackini Dexter (1956). The most obvious differences 



556 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

are the conspicuously flattened distal article of the second antenna 
and the footlike expansion at the terminal end thereof in B. campestris 
(fig. 2,a,d). 

Other noticeable differences are: (1) The antennule is relatively 
shorter than in B. mackini. It is about 60 percent of the length of 
the basal article of the antenna, whereas in mackini it averages 
85 percent of the length of the basal article. (2) The apophysis is 
smaller and is about half the size of that of mackini. (3) The proxi- 
mal article of the antenna of mackini presents on the median side of 
the distal one-fourth a small swollen area or projection bearing 3 to 7 
sensory cones, whereas in campestris such an eminence is lacking. 
(4) The food-gathering spines on the median border of the endopodite 
in mackini are relatively shorter, with heavier spinules, than those of 
campestris. (5) The telson in both males and females of campestris is 
about one-half the length of abdominal segment 6; in mackini it is 
only about one-third as long. 

The females differ from any species previously described in the 
lateral outpocketings of the ovisac (fig. 5,a,e), and in the large size of 
the dorsal bosses of the thorax (figs. 16, 46). 

Linder (1941) called attention to the arrangement of the paired 
dorsal sensory bristles on the thoracic segments of B. gaini and 
B. coloradensis , where those of thoracic segments 4 and 9 are nearer 
the middorsal line than the others. This arrangement occurs also in 
B. mackini and in B. campestris. Linder also mentions "granulated 
knobs" and "bulges," mostly lateral to the sensory bristles. 

In many species of Branchinecta a pair of delicate sensory bristles 
occurs on the dorsum of each segment from the first thoracic to the 
sixth abdominal. Each bristle is typically surrounded by a circular 
area of low cuticular granules or verrucae. The bosses of B. campestris 
correspond to these granular areas, which in this species are remark- 
ably developed, more or less hemispherical, and covered with coarse 
cuticular verrucae. The conspicuousness of the bosses is augmented 
by their being placed, especially those of segments 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, 
on a bulge or welt of the body wall. The sensory bristle persists in 
many; in some it appears to be absent, or at least is undemonstrable. 
Very rarely one of the anterior bosses is paired, but nothing correspond- 
ing to the more lateral and ventral thoracic lobes, such as are found in 
B. packardi or in B. lindahli has ever been found. 

The thoracic bosses of the female of B. mackini have the same 
arrangement, but are much less conspicuous because they are rela- 
tively smaller and rise much less above the surface. 

It is difficult to give brief and satisfactory measurements for the 
bosses, since they vary in size from segment to segment and from 
specimen to specimen, and since the height on each side is different 



FAIRY SHRIMP — LYNCH 557 

(lateral side is usually highest) and the transverse diameter is usually 
greater than the anteroposterior diameter. On the largest bosses 
the verrucose part may be 450 microns high on the lateral side, and 
the entire eminence 530 microns high. Length and breadth are 
usually somewhat greater than the height. Less elevated above 
the surface, the bosses of the genital segments are large, but less 
prominent than those of the thorax. Equivalent structures occur on 
abdominal segments 1 to 6, but are small, scarcely rise above the 
surface, and are normally distinguishable only by the use of the 
compound microscope. 

The females of B, campestris also differ from those of B. mackini in 
the following minor characteristics : (1) The spines on the distal 
median border of the endopodite of the female B. campestris are of the 
same type as those of B. mackini, but are relatively longer. In 
individuals of the same size, those of campestris are twice as long as 
those of mackini. (2) The antennule is usually from 85 percent to 
100 percent of the length of the antenna, sometimes slightly longer. 
In B. mackini it is always longer than the antenna, averaging 185 
percent as long. (3) In B. campestris 70 percent of the specimens 
have no connecting cells between the anterior and posterior groups 
of cement-gland cells, and the remainder have only a few, separated 
cells. In B. mackini 85 percent of the females have a continuous 
strand of juxtaposed cells on the dorsal side of the uterus connecting 
the anterior and posterior masses of cement-gland cells, and the re- 
mainder have scattered cells. (4) The ovisac is relatively shorter in 
campestris, where it terminates under abdominal segment 4 in 59 
percent of the females and never extends posteriorly to segment 5. 
In B. mackini, the length of the ovisac is more variable but on the 
average is longer since it terminates under abdominal segment 5 
in 69 percent and under segment 6 in 11.5 percent of the females. 

Other American species in which the distal article of the antenna 
of the male is compressed and turned in at the tip can be distinguished 
from B. campestris by a number of features, of which the following 
are most easily recognized: 

B. packardi Pearse, 1912: The males have both an apophysis and a 
large, proximally inclined protuberance on the median side of the 
proximal article of the antenna. The female has conspicuous conical 
lobes on the lateral side of the thorax, those of segments 9-11 and the 
first genital segment being the largest. 

B. lindahli Packard, 1883, revised by Sliantz 1905: The males have 
no apophysis or other protuberance on the median side of the basal 
article of the antenna. Full-grown females have lateral conical lobes 
on thoracic segments 4-11, those of segments 4-7 being the largest. 

B. coloradensis Packard, 1874, revised by Shantz 1905. The male 



558 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

has a large, thick apopysis, plus a large swollen verrucose area near 
the middle of the proximal article of the antenna. Females usually 
have conical lobes on the lateral sides of the thoracic segments. 

Color of living specimens: The males have no distinctive color 
pattern. To the unaided eye they usually appear a translucent white 
or yellowish white, rarely pinkish. 

Under low magnification the head is usually colorless, except for the 
yellow hepatic caeca, which are visible through the integument, but 
in some it is suffused with a faint green or bluish tinge. The eyes are 
black. The antennule is colorless or faint yellow. The proximal 
article of the antenna is white or yellow, usually more intensely yellow 
on the median side; rarely it may be faint brown, blue green, or yellow- 
ish pink. The distal article of the antenna is faint yellow and becomes 
darker toward the tip and on the narrow borders. The ventral side 
of the head and labrum ranges from pale yellow to pale blue, with a faint 
stippling of minute green or blue dots. Internally, the labrum 
contains large orange or brownish cells, visible through the integument. 

The thorax is typically colorless and lacking in colored cells or oil 
globules. The corm and endopodite of the thoracic appendages are 
dingy yellow, the other endites and exites colorless. 

The abdomen and cercopods are colorless, except for the posterior 
half of the intestine, which appears as a greenish-brown or black 
streak because of food residues. The genital segments are colorless, 
except for the heavily chitinized spur and adjacent sinus on the 
median side of the penes, which are yellow (fig. 4d). 

The females, to the unaided eye, appear nearly colorless except 
for the dark yellow eggs in the ovisac, the brownish spots of the 
cement glands, and the black intestine in the abdomen. 

The antennule is colorless. The antenna is usually colorless, but 
sometimes is faintly yellow or orange on the anterior side. The 
head is usually colorless except for the internal hepatic caeca, although 
the dorsal side is sometimes a faint blue. The eyes are black. The 
labrum may have a greenish or blue wash, and contains large, brownish 
cells, discernible through the translucent integument. 

The dorsal and lateral sides of the thorax are colorless, except for 
the dorsal bosses, which vary from yellow to brilliant orange. In- 
ternally, large blue cells may accompany the intestine for the length 
of the thorax, or may be present only in the posterior half. These 
cells also occur along the ventral portions of the intersegmental sutures 
of the thorax in some individuals. The thoracic appendages are 
nearly colorless, although the corm is often a faint yellow. 

The wall of the ovisac is colorless or glassy, except for the lateral 
outpocketings and adjacent area, which range from yellow to orange, 
and in some individuals the colored areas merge on the ventral side 



FAIRY SHRIMP — LYNCH 559 

of the ovisac. The cement glands vary from light yellow to dark 
brown but in most adult females are some shade of brown. The eggs 
within the uterus are usually an ochraceous yellow. The ovary, 
which extends from abdominal segment 4 or 3 to thoracic segment 
8 to 4, often contains large oocytes of white, greenish white, or pule 
blue-green tint. 

The abdomen is colorless except for the intestine, which appears 
blackish regardless of food content since the dark blue cells mentioned 
above accompany the intestine along its dorsal side from some part 
of the thorax to the fourth or fifth abdominal segment and in some 
individuals completely encircle the abdominal intestine. The cerco- 
pods are colorless. 

The females are unique among North American species of Branchi- 
necta in the yellow or orange spots on the outpocketings of the ovisac, 
and in the similarly colored thoracic bosses. 

Distribution and habitat. B. campestris has been collected in 
the State of Washington from the following localities : Three ephemeral 
ponds in the Lower Grand Coulee, Grant County, Washington, and 
five ponds scattered over an area of rough "scab land," 10 to 17 miles 
south of the town of Moses Lake, in southern Grant County and 
western Adams County. Most, or more likely all, of these ponds in 
Grant and Adams Counties have been destroyed in recent years by the 
construction of gigantic reservoirs filled with water from the Columbia 
River. These reservoirs have covered and annihilated some of the 
largest and most interesting "dry lakes" in North America. In 
addition, most of the ponds for miles below the dams have been con- 
verted, by continuous seepage, from ephemeral alkaline ponds into 
permanent fresh-water ponds in which none of the original unique 
and scarcely explored fauna of alkali-tolerant organisms has survived. 

One collection came from a pond in Okanogan County, Washington, 
about 10 miles north of LaFleur. Dr. G. C. Anderson (1958) report ed 
an unknown Branchinecta from Hot Lake, Okanogan County. Speci- 
mens that he kindly donated to the writer proved to be B. campestris. 
Two separate collections came from a pond situated at the eastern 
border of the town of Rawlins, Carbon County, Wyoming. The 
specimens from Rawlins differ slightly from those from Washington 
in that the females have somewhat smaller thoracic bosses, and the 
males have somewhat larger expansions at the tip of the antenna. 

B. campestris has always been found in water of extremely alkaline 
reaction, or at least with a high content of dissolved salts. The pH 
of water carried back to Seattle and determined a day or two later 
by a Beekman pH Meter, Model G, has ranged from 9.5 to 10. On 
the two occasions when the density of the water was ascertained, it was 
1.020 and 1.012 at 60° F. Usually, the new species has been found 



560 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

in clear water, as contrasted with B. mackini and B. gigas, common 
in the same area, which are usually in opaque water. The temper- 
ature of the water at the time that collections were made ranged from 
48° to 69° F. All collections in the State of Washington were made 
from late March to mid-June. The collections from near Rawlins, 
Wyoming were made on August 5, 1937, and June 20, 1958. 

The elevation above sea level of the ponds in which B. campestris 
has been found ranges from about 1,100 feet in Adams County, Wash- 
ington, to 6,750 feet near Rawlins, Wyoming. 

In 60 percent of the collections, B. campestris is the only phyllopod 
present. Artemia salina was, however, regularly present in three of 
the ponds in Grant County, and often the two species occurred simul- 
taneously; at times only one or the other species was present. In 
three other ponds in Grant County, B. mackini in small numbers was 
associated with B. campestris. 

In spite of the scanty data on physical conditions in the ponds, it 
seems evident that B. campestris is adapted to living in water with so 
high a content of dissolved salts that only Artemia salina can develop 
abundantly in the same habitat. This may account for its scarcity 
in Grant County, Washington (known from seven ponds) where, 
before the construction of enormous dams and the permanent inunda- 
tion of approximately 67 square miles of land with water from the 
Columbia River, there were literally hundreds of ponds that annually 
produced teeming populations of B. mackini. This circumstance pro- 
voked the thought that campestris might be only a variety of 
mackini developing in water of greater alkalinity and density than 
its more usual habitat. This conjecture seems most unlikely, how- 
ever, in view of the relatively large number of specific differences, and 
my failure to find unmistakable intergradations between the two 
species. 

Remarks. Including the subject of this paper there are now eight 
species of Branchinecta reported from western North America, and 
several undescribed species that await the attention of systematists. 
In addition, redescriptions of several species and a study of the 
variability of others are in order before an adequate revision of, and 
keys to, the species of the genus in North America can be made.

STARGAZER FISHES 

FROM THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC 

(FAMILY URANOSCOPIDAE) 



By Frederick H. Berry and William W. Anderson l 



This review of the fishes of the family Uranoscopidae from the 
western North Atlantic is a consequence of our efforts to identify 
large series of various sizes of these fishes that have been taken in 
recent years by exploratory fishing in this area. It is based on all 
the uranoscopid specimens from this area in the collections of the 
U.S. National Museum, selected specimens from other institutions, 
and specimens at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Biological 
Laboratory at Brunswick, Georgia. Many of the specimens at 
Brunswick will subsequently be transferred to the U.S. National 
Museum. 

Five species of stargazers have been recognized in our study of the 
family in the western North Atlantic. Illustrations, diagnostic 
characters, and known ranges are presented for these species. Astro- 
scopus y-graecum Cuvier and Astroscopus guttatvs Abbott are dis- 
tinguished. Execestides Jordan and Thompson is synonymized with 
G/uithagnus Gill, and E. egregius Jordan and Thompson is included in

the genus Gnathagnus. Gnathagnus laticeps (Longley and Hildebrand) 
is synonymized with Gnathagnus egregius. Kathetostoma albigutta 
cubana Barbour is distinguished as a species distinct from Katheto- 
stoma albigutta Bean. Uranoscopus occidentalis Agassiz, described 
from Brazil, is included on the basis of the type description. 

Astroscopus sexspinosus (Steindachner) was described from Argen- 
tina and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the western South Atlantic (Stein- 
dachner, 1876) as Uranoscopus (Upsulonophorus) sexspinosus. It 
reportedly differs from A. y-graecum and A. guttatus in having a 
blackened border on the soft dorsal fin (Miranda Ribeiro, 1915), but 
specimens adequate for assessing its true relationship have not been 
available. 

Data on dorsal and anal rays and data on pectoral rays are given 
in table 1, p. 566. A chart of distribution of Kathetostoma albigutta, 
K. cubana, and Gnathagnus egregius is shown in figure 1, next page. 

Standard length (S.L.) was measured from the middle of the upper 
jaw (premaxillary symphysis) to the caudal base. Total length 
(T.L.) was measured from the most anterior part of the lower jaw to 
end of the caudal fin. 

Dorsal and anal fin ray counts were made by counting the total 
number of rays (or ray bases), except in a minority of specimens that 
had the terminal soft ray in very close proximity to the next to the 
last soft ray. Dissection and clearing and staining showed that in 
certain specimens the terminal dorsal or anal soft ray was branched 
to its base and the two terminal elements were articulated beneath 
the body surface; it was therefore considered a branched ray and was 
counted as a single ray. 

Pectoral and pelvic rays were counted on each side of the fish, and 
are recorded without respect to right or left sides. Bilateral varia- 
tion may occur in the number of pectoral fin rays, but the side of a 
fish having the greater number is randomly right or left. 

Terminology of the cranial bones follows Gregory (1933, figs. 244- 
248). 

In the synonymies, a comma is used between the binomial and the 
author's name only in instances of emended or altered specific combi- 
nations; no comma is used in instances of original combinations. 

The specimens examined are listed for each species by geographical 
location from north to south along the Atlantic coast of the United 
States to southern Florida, then northward, westward, and southward 
around the Gulf of Mexico into the Caribbean Sea. The following

Synonomy: Giinther (1860, p. 227) listed as Uranoscopus occi- 
dentalis a stuffed adult specimen from the "West Indies" and two 
young specimens from the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa; Fowler 
(1936, p. 1033) included the reference of the young specimens in the 



STARGAZER FISHES BERRY AND ANDERSON 569 

synonomy of the Eastern Atlantic Uranoscopus scaber Linnaeus. 
G. Palmer of the British Museum (Natural History) in a communica- 
tion of August 31, 1959, wrote regarding the adult specimen: "On 
checking the locality for the adult specimen, I find that the old 
register gives this as Mauritius and not the West Indies. It is part 
of a collection purchased by the Museum in 1841 from Stevens. 
The material was collected by Janvier, who certainly did work in the 
Mauritius area. I think the listing of the locality by Giinther as 
the "West Indies" must be regarded as a lapsus calami on his part!" 
Agassiz's specimen may have been Uranoscopus scaber or some other 
species of Uranoscopus, but we record it as a distinct species because 
no other specimen of Uranoscopus has been reported from the Ameri- 
can continents, and there is not sufficient evidence to warrant placing 
it in the synonymy of any other species. 

Diagnosis: Dorsal spines four. Dorsal soft rays 14. Anal soft 
rays 13 or 14. Pectoral rays 16. Lower jaw without a pair of 
prominent converging bony ridges. Top of head covered with 
exposed cranial bones. Cleithral spine long, sharp pointed, and pro- 
truding through the skin. Body scales present. 

Color: Spinous dorsal fin black. 

Range: Brazil (probably in the western South Atlantic), only the 
type specimen recorded.

Synonymy: Axtroscopus y-yraecum and A. guttatus have frequently 
been confused, due partly to the failure to recognize growth changes 
in head sculpture in the two species. In earlier years it was due also 

567168 — 61 — 2 



572 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

to the recognition of a third nominal species of this group, Astroscopus 
anolopos, apparently based on a small specimen of A. y-graecum that 
still had the larval character of the head covered by the exposed cranial 
bones. We have not examined larval specimens of A. guttatus and 
therefore cannot distinguish them from larval A. y-graecum other than 
by distribution. Larval specimens of Astroscopus from the North 
Carolina coast, where the ranges of the two species are known to 
overlap, are identified only to genus; specific identifications of larvae 
from north and south of North Carolina are presumptive. In a 
publication containing many life history notes and theories, Dahlgren 
(1 927) discussed both Astroscopus y-graecum and A. guttatus and stated 
(p. 364): "Where they overlap in the neighborhood of Cape Hatteras 
it seems practically certain that they interbreed, and great variation 
is found." Dahlgren did not, however, record his criteria for separa- 
tion of the two species, and we are convinced that he misidentified 
some of his specimens (see synonymies). 

Diagnosis: Dorsal spines III to V. Dorsal soft rays 13 to 15. 
Anal soft rays 12 to 14. Pectoral ra} T s 19 to 22. Pelvic rays I, 5. 
Pelvic girdle without exposed anteriorly directed spines. Top of head 
covered by exposed cranial bones to about 31 mm. S.L. ; in larger sizes 
the frontal bones exposed posteriorly on the head, with their medial 
processes forming an exposed Y-shaped process that extends anteriorly 
between the eyes, and with the area within the fork of the Y and lateral 
to it covered by skin; with growth the basal arm of the Y becomes 
long and narrow and the fleshy area becomes comparatively large; 
least width of the basal arm of the Y about 1.4 to 2.4 percent of stand- 
ard length at sizes larger than 100 mm. S.L. Posterior nostrils each 
in a fringed groove curving around behind the eye; posterior end of 
nostril groove much closer to back of eye than to posterior margin 
of skin-covered area over electric organs; distance from eye to end of 
rear nostril groove (a in plate la) into distance from end of rear nostril 
groove to posterior margin of skin- covered area (b in plate lo) about 1.9 
to 11.0 times (in sizes above 40 mm. S.L.). Lower jaw without a pair 
of prominent converging bony ridges. 

Preoperculum and operculum without spines or processes above 
about 35 mm. S.L. (in smaller sizes the preoperculum has a blunt 
angle spine, and a bluntly pointed spine is present at the upper anterior 
margin of the operculum) . Cleithral spine small, laterally compressed, 
covered by skin and adpressed to body. Scales present on body and 
extending onto fleshy part of caudal fin; scales absent on head, an area 
posterior to the pectoral fin bases, the throat and abdomen, between 
the lateral lines and the dorsal fin, and a narrow area along the anal 
fin base. Lateral lines on each side of body extending from head 
along back close to dorsal fin, bending down through central part of 



STARGAZER FISHES — BERRY AND ANDERSON 573 

caudal base onto fleshy part of caudal fin, then bending anteroventrally 
to unite at bottom of caudal base. 

Color: Body and head generally dark above and light below; tip 
of lower jaw and upper part of head and body to end of dorsal base 
with large, irregular, widely spaced white spots having narrow dark 
margins (these spots not formed on specimens less than about 47 mm. 
standard length); a dark stripe extending along middle of caudal 
peduncle; a large elongated black blotch on each side of chin. Spinous 
dorsal fin black. Soft dorsal fin with from one to three oblique black 
bars (one bar present between about 50 and 70 mm. standard length, 
two bars between about 55 and 130 mm., three bars above about 
120 mm.). Anal fin with an elongated black stripe extending across 
most of the softrays (formed between about 53 and 60 mm. standard 
length). Pectoral fins dusky over most of fin, tending to become black- 
near tip, with a narrow light margin (pigment becoming pronounced 
at about 50 mm. standard length). Pelvics with an elongated dusky 
or blackish spot near the distal end of the inner rays (forming at about 
110 mm. standard length). Caudal fin with one or three black stripes 
(one stripe formed at about 40 mm. standard length, three stripes 
formed at about 55 mm.). 

Size: Largest specimen examined, 323 mm. S.L. (440 mm. or 17.5 
inches total length). Smallest specimen examined, 12 mm. S.L. 

Range: From Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, southward along 
the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts and the coast of Central 
and South America to Santos, Brazil. From recorded specimens this 
species appears to be an inshore, relatively shallow water inhabitant. 
Springer and Bullis (1956, p. 96) recorded the species from one Oregon 
station at 38 fathoms from off Alabama— apparently the greatest 
depth to be recorded.

Pearson 1941, p. 98, fig. 25); in larger sizes (at least by 43 mm. S.L.) 
the frontal bones exposed posteriorly on the head, with their medial 
proeesses forming an exposed Y-shaped proeess that extends anteriorly 
to between or just behind the eyes, and with the area within the fork 
of the Y and lateral to it covered by skin; in large specimens the basal 
arm of the Y short and broad and the skin-covered area only moder- 
ately enlarged; least width of the basal arm of the Y about 2.5 to 3.8 
percent of standard length in sizes larger than 100 nun. S.L. Posterior 
nostrils each in a fringed groove curving around behind the eye; 
posterior end of nostril groove usually closer to posterior margin of 
skin-covered area over electric organs than to eye or not much closer 
to eye; distance from eye to end of rear nostril groove (a in plate 1g) into 
distance from end of rear nostril groove to posterior margin of skin- 
covered area (b in plate 1g) about 0.5 to 1.0 times (at sizes above 40 
nun. S.L.). Lower jaw without a pair of prominent converging 
bony ridges. 

Preoperculum and operculum without spines or processes. Clei- 
thral spine small, laterally compressed, covered by skin and adpressed 
to body. Scales present on body and extending onto fleshy part of 
caudal fin; scales absent on head, an area posterior to the pectoral fin 
bases, the throat and abdomen, between the lateral lines and the dorsal 
fin, and a narrow area along the anal fin base. Lateral lines on each 
side of body extending from head along back close to dorsal fin, 
bending down through central part of caudal base onto fleshy part of 
caudal fin, then bending anteriovcntrally to unite at bottom of caudal 
base. 

Color: Body and head generally dusky above and light below; tip 
of lower jaw and upper part of head and body to end of dorsal base 
with many small and irregular white spots; a dark stripe extending 
along middle of caudal peduncle; a large elongated black blotch on 
(vi eh side of chin. Spinous dorsal fin black. Soft dorsal fin with 
about 4 oblique black bars. Anal fin with an elongated blackish 
stripe extending across most of the soft rays. Pectoral fins dusk}* over 
most of fin, tending to become black near tip, and with a narrow light 
margin. Pelvic fins mostly clear with a dusky or dark spot between 
distal ends of last two rays. Caudal fin with about three black stripes. 

Size: Largest specimen reported, 12% inches total length (about 
220 mm. S.L.), from Chesapeake Bay (Hildebrand and Schroeder, 
1927, p. 331). Smallest specimens reported, 2.5 to 5 mm. T.L. and 
23 mm. T.L. (Pearson, 1941, p. 98, figs. 24-25). Largest specimen 
examined 215 mm. S.L. Smallest specimen examined 37 mm. S.L. 
Dahlgren (1927, p. 358) reported specimens as Astroscopus (presum- 
ably this species) from several miles off the Virginia coast that were up 
to 22 inches in total length and weighed up to 15 or 20 pounds.

Range: From Long Island, New York, to Cape Lookout, North 
Carolina. This species primarily inhabits inshore, shallow, sandy 
areas. Dahlgren (1927, p. 362) speculated that larger individuals 
spawned at depths of 30 to 200 feet.

Diagnosis: No spinous dorsal fin. Dorsal soft rays 13 to 15. 
Anal soft rays 12 to 15. Pectoral rays 14 to 16. Pelvic rays I, 5, 
the spine obscured by skin. Pelvic girdle with paired anterior 
processes of conical spines protruding through the skin. Top of 
head covered by exposed cranial bones; a shallow anterior recess of 
the frontal bones between the eyes. Posterior nostrils not in fringed 
grooves. Lower jaw without a pair of prominent converging bony 
ridges. Preoperculum with three spines extending from ventral 
margin; operculum without a spine. Cleithral spine prominent, 
conical, sharply pointed, and extending posterodorsally. No scales 
present (scalelike structures present in lateral line). Lateral lines 
on each side of body extending from head along back close to dorsal 
fin, bending down to middle of caudal base, and ending between and 
nearly at ends of central caudal rays. 

Color: Lower half of body whitish. Upper half of body with 
rounded white spots on brownish background, margins of the spots 
of darker brown, the spots confined mainly to predorsal area on small 
specimens, on large specimens the posterior spots larger and elongate. 
Pectoral fins with brownish black pigment across the fins. Pelvics 
clear. Anal fin with small area of pigment at posterior base. Dorsal 
fin with two to five and caudal fin with three or more blackish elongated 
spots, the spots more numerous in larger specimens. 

Size: Largest specimen examined 204 mm. S.L. (about 10.2 inches 
T.L.). Smallest specimen examined 29 mm. S.L. A 21-mm. S.L. 
specimen is identified only to genus, because it lacks distinctive pig- 
mentation and the pectoral fins are damaged. 

Range: From Cape Lookout, N.C., to the Florida Keys and 
around the Gulf of Mexico to Campeche Bank off Yucatan. Depth 
records of all but one of the known specimens range from 22 to 100 
fathoms, with the majority of these records between 30 and 60 
fathoms. One specimen was recorded from 210 fathoms south of the 
Florida Keys where the Continental Shelf is very steep.

Synonymy: Barbour (1941, p. 1), apparently noting only color 
differences, described K. cubana as a subspecies of K. albiguita. 
Because of the consistent and discrete color differences, differences in 
pectoral ray counts and geographical and depth distribution, and 
differences in modal numbers of anal soft rays, we evaluate K. cubana 
as a distinct species. 

Diagnosis: No spinous dorsal fin. Dorsal soft rays 13 to 15. 
Anal soft rays 13 or 14. Pectoral rays 17 or 18. Pelvic ra} r s I, 5, the 
spine obscured by skin. Pelvic girdle with paired anterior processes 
of conical spines protruding through the skin. Top of head covered 
by exposed cranial bones; a shallow anterior recess of the frontal 
bones between the eyes. Posterior nostrils not in fringed grooves. 
Lower jaw without a pair of prominent converging bony ridges. 
Preopcrculum with three spines extending from ventral margin; 
operculum without a spine. Cleithral spine prominent, conical, 
sharply pointed, and extending posterodorsally. No scales present 
(scalelike structures present in lateral line). Lateral lines on each 
side of body extending from head along back close to dorsal fin, 
bending down to middle of caudal base, and ending between and 
nearly at ends of central caudal rays. Barbour (1941, p. 2) recorded 
fin counts as "usually with D. 11 and A. 11," but we have examined 
five paratypes and six other specimens in which the counts are con- 
sistently higher. 

Color: Ventral part of body unpigmented, sides of body and head 
with faint pigment, dorsal surface of body and head mottled with 
irregular dull brown spots. Pelvic and anal (ins unpigmented. 
Pectoral fins faintly pigmented. Dorsal fin faintly pigmented along 
the rays. Caudal fin with faintly pigmented spot on upper part of 
base and a broad darker blackish stripe located about middle of fin. 

Size: Largest specimen reported about 146 mm. S.L. (7.75 inches 
T.L.). Smallest specimen examined 54.5 mm. S.L. 

Range: Off the Little Bahama Banks, the Grand Bahama Banks, 
the northern coast of Cuba, off eastern Puerto Rico, and in the Carib- 
bean off eastern Honduras. All the known specimens but one have

Synonymy: We adhere to Myers' (1946, p. 42) decision in placing 
Benthoscopus laticeps in the genus Gnathagnus Gill. We include 
Execestides Jordan and Thompson in the synonymy of Gnathagnus. The 
major recorded difference between G. laticeps and Execestides egregius 
was that the former had scales, the latter was scaleless. Our speci- 
mens of Gnathagnus, ranging from 243 mm. S.L. down to 57.5 mm. 
S.L., showed a pronounced structural ontogeny, and the presence of 
scales on all of these confirmed their identification as G. laticeps. 
George S. Myers, Margaret Storey, and Stanley H. Weitzman of the 
Stanford University Natural History Museum cooperated in furnish- 
ing us with information on the small type specimen of E. egregius, 
reported to lack scales. A portion of mucous scraped from the side 
near the peduncle of the type was stained with alizarin and a small 
scale was found to be present in the scrapings, presumptive evidence 
that the type specimen has small, hidden scales and supporting our 
placing G. laticeps in the synonymy of E. egregius in the genus 
Gnathagnus. 

Diagnosis: No spinous dorsal fin. Dorsal soft rays 12 to 14. 
Anal soft rays 16 or 17. Pectoral rays 20 to 24. Pelvic rays I, 5. 
Pelvic girdle without exposed anteriorly directed spines. Top of 
head covered by exposed cranial bones; a shallow anterior recess of 
the frontal bones between the eyes. Posterior nostrils not in fringed 
grooves. Lower jaw with the dentary bones forming a pair of promi- 
nent converging bony ridges on the anterior part, deeply notched 
between. Preoperculum with a flattened process, usually bluntly 
pointed, extending posteriolaterally from across angle of the bone, 
diminishing with growth; operculum striated and ridged and ending 



582 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

in a spine which diminishes with growth. Cleithral spine prominent, 
laterally compressed, and curved posteriodorsally. Scales present on 
body and extending onto fleshy part of caudal fin; scales absent on 
head, an area posterior to pectoral fin bases, the throat and abdomen, 
a small area posterior to the bones on top of the head, and a narrow 
area along the anal fin base; the scales small and deeply embedded in 
smaller specimens (the largest scale found on a 57.5-mm. specimen 
had a maximum diameter of 0.19 mm.). Lateral lines on each side 
of body extending from head along back close to dorsal fin, bending 
down to middle of caudal base, and ending between and nearly at 
ends of central caudal rays. 

Color: At about 47 mm. S.L. (holotype description), body color 
blackish, fins pale with a blackish area at base of each, a pale streak 
along lateral line and one across base of dorsal. From 57.5 to 71.5 
mm. S.L., head and dorsal half of body with irregular dark blotches 
tending to form broken stripes on back, scattered small pigment spots 
on rest of body, pelvics with spots at bases, other fins dark near bases. 
By 76 mm. S.L., head no longer dark spotted. By 87 mm. S.L., 
about the proximal three-fourths of the pectoral, dorsal, anal, and 
caudal fins are darkened, and the body has taken on a brownish cast. 
By 113 mm. S.L., the coloration of the upper half of the body consists 
of numerous small pigment spots, on some specimens these coalesce 
in some areas to form short lines. 

Size: Largest specimen examined, 13 inches T.L. (243 mm. S.L.). 
Smallest specimen reported, 2% inches total length (the holotype, 
about 47 mm. S.L.). 

Range: All known specimens have been taken from off the coast 
of the United States: From off northern Georgia, eastern Florida, 
Tortugas and northwestern Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and 
southern Texas. Of the specimens we examined, those larger than 
100 mm. S.L. were taken from between about 101 and 240 fathoms; 
those from 71.5 to 100 mm. S.L. were taken from between 80 and 112 
fathoms; and a 57.5-mm. S.L. specimen was taken at Dinner Key in 
Biscayne Bay, Florida. An 87-mm. T.L. specimen was reported from 
between 21 and 31 fathoms (Hildebrand, 1954, p. 318), and the 2% 
inch holotype was taken "on the reef at Garden Key" (Jordan and 
Thompson, 1905, p. 254).

590 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. 112 

The terminology used for the groups of photophores is presented 
in figures 1 and 2, on pages 588-589. 

Each fin ray that has a separate base was counted, and all rudiments 
of gill rakers were counted on the first gill arch. 

Radiographs were expertly made by Robert H. Kanazawa and 
T. John Leppi for the various genera and species of this family, and 
from those films the number of vertebrae are recorded in table 1, p. 591. 

Gill (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., vol. 7, pp. 349-351, 1884) gives the 
relationships among the genera and a list of the family and sub- 
family synonymy. Gregory and Conrad (Copeia, No. 1, p. 27, 1936) 
discuss the relationships of the family Sternoptychidae with other 
forms. Wilimovsky (Copeia, No. 3, pp. 247-248, 1951) corrects the 
spelling of the family name. Hubbs (Copeia, No. 2, p. 97, 1953) 
thinks, as did earlier authors, that the family Sternoptychidae should be 
expanded to include Gonostomatinae and the Maurolicinae. Not 
having studied all the fishes in those relationships, I tentatively 
assign to the Sternoptychidae those genera with a dorsal blade, exter- 
nally visible and in front of the soft dorsal fin. 

Family Sternoptychidae 

The marine silver hatchetfishes, family Sternoptychidae, may be 
distinguished as a group by the dorsal blade, which represents the 
highly specialized dorsal pterygiophores, externally evident in front of 
the dorsal fin. These pterygiophores may be fused into a thin plate 
as in Argyropelecus, a small pair of bony keels as in Polyipnus, or a 
single elongate spine as in Sternoptyx. Body thin, compressed, its 
depth very great; abdominal vertebrae 11, caudal vertebrae 17 to 29; 
branched caudal rays 9 + 8 ; scales probably present, very thin. The 
scales are usually lost in preservation, so that they are seldom seen, 
and thus from museum specimens no evaluation of their significance 
is possible. 

The sternoptychids are deep-sea fishes with groups of characteristi- 
cally arranged photophores for each genus, as are illustrated in the 
figures beginning on p. 623. They are caught in the open sea in plank- 
ton nets, trawls, and other gear in all temperate and tropical seas from 
the surface to considerable depths. Records from the Pacific indicate 
depths of 16,200 feet and from the Atlantic 12,704 feet. Such depths, 
however, are inadequately documented because closing nets were 
seldom used in oceanographic exploration. The fish could have been 
caught somewhere between the surface and the deepest point reached 
by the equipment. 

The present study recognizes 9 species and 3 subspecies for Argyro- 
pelecus, 1 species for Sternoptyx, and 12 species and 2 subspecies for 
Polyipnus.

Genus Argyropelecus Cocco 

Argyropelecus Cocco, Giorn. Sci. Lett. Arti Sicilia, vol. 26, No. 77, p. 46, 1829 

(type species Argyropelecus hemigymnus Cocco). 
Sternopty chides Ogilby, Proc. Linn. Soc. New South Wales, ser. 2, vol. 3, p. 1313, 

1888 (type species Sternoplychides amabilis Ogilby). 
Pleurothyris Lowe, A history of the fishes of Madeira . . . , vol. 1, p. 64, 1843 

(type species Stemoptyx olfersi Cuvier). 

I consider the following unidentifiable: 

Argyropelecus bocagei Osorio, Mem. Mus. Bocage, Lisbon, fasc. 1, p. 27, 
pi. 2, fig. 3, 1909 (type locality near Setubal) .—Seabra, Bull. Soc. 
Portugaise Sci. Nat., vol. 5, fasc. 3, p. 176, 1911 (Setubal). — Nobre, 
Fauna marinha de Portugal, vertebrados, vol. 1, pt. 3, Peixes 
de Portugal, p. 350, 1935 (Setubal). 

Argyropelecus elongatus Esmark, Forh. Vid. Selsk. Christiana 1870, p. 
489, 1871. 

Species referable to the genus Argyropelecus have the following 
characters in common: 

Abdominal vertebrae 1 1 ; caudal vertebrae 23 to 29 ; branched caudal 
fin rays 9+8; pectoral rays 9 to 12; dorsal 8 to 10; anal 6 to 8+5 or 6; 
gill rakers on first gill arch 7 to 11+8 to 14 totaling 15 to 25. 

The number of organs in groups of photophores are as follows: 

Abdominal 12; anal 6; branchiostegal 6; isthmus 6; preanal 4; 
preopercular 1 ; preorbital 1 ; postorbital 1 ; subcaudal 4 ; subopercular 
1; supra-abdominal 6; suprapectoral 2; for location of groups of 
photophores see figure 1 , p. 588. On the maxillary the dentition is char- 
acteristic because on the anterior part of that bone the teeth point 
posteriorly, and on its posterior part the teeth point anteriorly. 
The number of teeth pointing forward and aft is variable (see table 
2, p. 592), the number appearing to increase slightly with increase in 
size. 

Certain species, such as aculcatus, when sexual maturity is reached, 
develop spines around the subcaudal photophores and in front of them, 
between the divided anal fin, around the anus, on the dorsal blade, 
and on the ridges of the head. Both males and females may develop 
these spines. 

The various species may be distinguished on the basis of counts of 
fins rays, gill rakers, and vertebrae and distribution and location of 
groups of photophores. In addition, the characteristics of the post- 
abdominal and preopercular spines are of utmost importance in the 
recognition of species and groups of species. 

An important feature of the genus is the dorsal blade, which con- 
sists not of dorsal spines or rays but of more or less fused 
pterygiophores, the dorsal rays having been lost. Radiographs 



MARINE SILVER HATCHETFISHES — SCHULTZ 595 

show seven or eight of these pterygiophores, the last two somewhat 
fused together externally, but all forming a bony blade. 

Another pecularity of the genus is the lack of anal pterygiophores 
opposite two or three vertebrae, usually beteeen the 9th to 12th caudal 
vertebrae. The pterygiophores that normally occur opposite these 
vertebrae are displaced anteriorly and posteriorly, where they are 
crowded between adjoining vertebrae. 

In certain groups of photophores the organs in the post larvae 
increase in number with increase in length up to a certain size, after 
which the full complement of light organs are formed. For example in 
Argyropelecus hemigymnus, the relationship of number of organs to 
standard length is:

These data indicate for A. hemigymnus that the full complement 
of photophores for the preanal, anal, and subcaudal groups is not 
reached until a standard length of about 10 mm. is attained. In 
A. aculeatus the anal photophores reach six in number at about 12 mm. 
in length. 

Tables 1-3 give tho counts and measurements that were made for 
certain species and subspecies of Argyropelecus.

Distinctive characters: Three species of Argyropelecus form 
what may be called the affinis, gigas, and pacificus complex, charac- 
terized by the supra-abdominal, preanal, anal and subcaudal photo- 
phores almost forming a continuous series and the dorsal tips of the 
photophores being nearly in a straight line. Lower preopercular 
spine points downward and curves outward and forward; upper pre- 
opercular spine short, pointing outward, and usually curving forward, 
never extending posteriorly; two posterior abdominal spines, both 
short and directed downward, forming an acute angle between them 
of about 10° to 15°; space between anal group and subcaudal group 
of photophores very narrow, about equal to width of last anal photo- 



MARINE SILVER HATCHETFISHES — SCHTJLTZ 599 

phore. In these three species the dorsal blade is low, as is indicated 
in the key on p. 595. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
2, p. 592; the measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. The 
photophores are arranged as shown in figure 3, p. G23. 

Greatest depth of body 2.1 to 2.4 in standard length; exposed part 
of longest spine in dorsal blade 2.2 to 2.9 times in length of base of 
soft dorsal; no postorbital spine; ventral edge of pectoral shield with- 
out sharp points although edge is somewhat scalloped. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 3, p. 623. 

Range: This pelagic species lives in considerable depths of the 
ocean. It probably is confined to the Atlantic Ocean and is replaced 
in the Pacific Ocean by A. pacijicus, which is a very close relative. 
I have not been able to check the specimens reported from the Indian 
Ocean. I studied 12 lots from the Atlantic Ocean as follows: 1 speci- 
men from off Delaware, 5 off Georgia; 3 off Florida, 2 from the Car- 
ibbean, 1 from off Jamaica; 2 off Puerto Rico, 1 from Lesser Antilles, 
and 1 from Gulf of Mexico. It has been taken as far south as lat. 31° 
S. (Barnard, 1925) and as far north as lat. 39°56' N. (USNM 31709); 
Norman (1939) reports depths of capture to 3,872 meters, but since 
closing nets were not used this depth is uncertain. The usual depths 
are less than 1,000 fathoms.

photophore to upper edge of first preanal photophore 88, 109, 106, 113, 
and 110. Distance from orbit to base of upper preopercular spine 
152, 162, 168, 161, and 172. Distance from tip of snout to rear edge 
of maxillary 250, 262, 263, 254, and 259. 

Counts made on the types are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 2, 
p. 592; measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 4, p. 623. 

Range: This species occurs in the eastern Pacific westward to the 
Hawaiian Islands. It has been taken to a depth of 930 fathoms 
(USNM 87563). 

Remarks: This species differs from its closest relatives, A. affinis 
and A. gigas, as indicated in the key on p. 595.

men, 87 mm. 

Distinctive characters: The body deep, greatest depth con- 
tained about 1.9 to 2.0 times in standard length; dorsal blade high, 
height of last spine above pigmented area contained 1.5 to 1.9 times 
in length of base of soft dorsal; one or two small spines behind orbit. 

Dr. N. B. Marshall, British Museum (Natural History) has ex- 
amined the three types and finds that the postabdominal spines are 
the same as in affinis, as is shown in figure 26a, p. 634. The sketch 
of these spines sent with his letter of January 21, 1958, is greatly 
appreciated. 

Description: The arrangement of photophores and other details 
of this species are represented in figure 5, p. 624. Counts made 
are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 2, p. 592; measurements made 
are given in table 3, p. 593. 

Color: The color pattern is shown is figure 5, p. 624. 

Range: So far this species has been found only in the Atlantic 
Ocean.

Distinctive characters: A. hemigymnus and A. intermedins 
form what may be called the hemigymnus complex. The former 
appears to be confined to the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, and 
A. intermedins to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. My opinion is 
based on the specimens available. In each of these vast regions 
there may be populations or even subspecies that could be distin- 
guished, but this possibility requires verification through special 
studies of hundreds of specimens from each of numerous localities. 

The following characters are possessed by both species: Lower 
preopercular spine almost straight and directed nearly straight 
downward; upper preopercular spine rather long, curved a little 
upward and outward, notably extending past rear margin of bony 
edge of preopercle; a single serrated postabdominal spine directed 
posteriorly, the lower margin of spine almost in line with lower edge 
of abdomen, usually a minute spinule dorsally on posterior basal 
part of postabdominal spine. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
2, p. 592, measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. This species 
is notable for its slender body behind the preanal group of photo- 
phores, the compact nature of the anal and subcaudal groups of 
photophores, and the wide spaces separating preanal, anal, and es- 
pecially the subcaudal group of photophores from the anal group. 
A white bar occurs between preanal and anal and another between 
anal and subcaudal groups of photophores. These white bars are 
separated by a dark bar. 

Range: This species appears to be replaced in the Pacific and 
Indian Oceans by A. intermedins. A. hemigymnus is the only species 
of this genus that has so far been reported from the Mediterranean Sea. 
Numerous specimens were available for study in over 85 lots from the 
following general localities : Mediterranean Sea (54) ; Azores (9) ; off 
Iceland (4); vicinity of Bermuda (60); off New York (18); off South 
Carolina (1); off Georgia (1); Bahamas and West Indies (110); Carib- 
bean Sea (1). I have not seen any specimen of A. hemigymnus from 
the Gulf of Mexico. The farthest north from which I have seen a 
specimen was lat. 42°56' N., long. 30°19' W. (MCZ 34990) and to 
a depth of 3,000 meters (Pappeuheim, 1914). It also occurs in the 
South Atlantic.

Distinctive characters: A. intermedins differs from A. hemigym- 
nus in having the tips of spines of dorsal blade smooth, and in the 
ventral edge of the bony pectoral shield having a few minute points 
on the scalloped edges instead of the reverse as occurs in hemigymnus. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
2, p. 592; measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 7, p. 625.

Range: Although I have not seen any specimens from the Indian 
Ocean, this species probably replaces hemigymnus in the Central and 
Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. It occurs as far north as lat. 
40°35' N. and as deep as 565 fathoms in the Northwestern Pacific. 
Alcock (1896) had specimens from the Bay of Bengal from a depth of 
1803 fathoms.

N., long. 70°39' W., to lat. 39°48' N., long. 70°28' W., 2 specimens, 
13.5 to 18 mm. BOC 3768 (nolo type of Argyropelecus micracanthus 
Parr) . 

Distinctive characters: Lower preopercular spine directed 
straight downward and curved a little outward; upper preopercular 
spine short, pointing outward, its tip not extending past rear margin 
of bony edge of preoperclc; a single postabdominal spine directed 
downward and curved a little forward; space between anal group and 
subcaudal group of photophorcs about equal to width of last two anal 
photophores; supra-abdominal, preanal, and anal photophores not in 
a straight line; caudal peduncle crossed with a white or pale bar be- 
tween anal and subcaudal groups of photophorcs. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 2, 
p. 592; measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. This deep 
bodied species, when it reaches a standard length of over 35 mm., de- 
velops spines along the ventral edge of the caudal peduncle, around the 
anus, and the ventral bony edge of the abdominal ridge becomes ser- 
rated; also three flat bonylike spines develop between the two parts 
of the anal fin; the space between anal and subcaudal groups of photo- 
phores is much greater in small specimens than in the adults. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 8, p. 625. 

Range: This species occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and at Lord 
Howe Island in the Pacific Ocean to a depth of at least 550 fathoms 
and perhaps over 1,000 fathoms (Parr 1937). 

Remarks: H. aculeatus may be confused with II. amabilis when 
the posterior abdominal spine of aculeatus is damaged and only the 
anterior one remains.

and the prints show the holotype to be badly damaged; preopercular spines 
are lacking, as is the rear postabdominal spine, the base of which has a ragged 
edge, indicating that it was broken off. There is little doubt that A. caninus 
is a synonym of A. aculeatus).

Distinctive characters: Lower preopercular spine directed down- 
ward and slightly curved outward; upper preopercular spine short, 



MARINE SILVER HATCHETFISHES — SCHULTZ 609 

directed a little outward and posteriorly but not extending beyond 
bony edge of preopercle; 2 post abdominal spines, the anterior one 
directed ventrally and curving a little forward, the rear spine much 
longer and stronger, directed posteriorly and curving ventrally; pos- 
terior spine sometimes with 1 or 2 spinelets on the ventral side; the 
angle between postabdominal spines about 70° to 100°; space between 
anal group and subcaudal group of photophores rather narrow, about 
equal to width of last 3 anal photophores; supra -abdominal, preanal, 
and anal photophores not in a straight line; caudal peduncle crossed 
with a white or pale bar between anal and subcaudal groups of photo- 
phores; translucent part of abdominal keel notably wider than width 
of middle two anal photophores. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
2, p. 592; measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. Greatest 
depth of pigmented part of body 1.0 to 1.1 and length of dorsal blade 
4.5 to 6.5 times, both in postorbital length of bod}^. When it reaches 
a standard length greater than 25 mm., this deep bodied species 
develops a series of spines under the subcaudal photophores, a double 
series in front of subcaudal photophores, and a double group around 
the anus and 3 flat bonylike spines between the 2 parts of the anal 
fin; the bony ridges on head and dorsal blade also develop series of 
bony serrae; these occur on both males and females. 

The four subcaudal photophores of equal size are in a straight 
line, whereas the first and last two anal photophores are notably 
larger than the middle three and dorsal edges are not in a straight 
line. 

In alcohol there is a white bar across caudal peduncle between 
anal and subcaudal group of photophores up to a length of about 
50 mm., after which it darkens like rest of body; base of lower lobe 
of caudal fin with a blackish posterior extension at least one-fourth 
the length of lower caudal fin rays. 

Some specimens are difficult to distinguish from olfersi if the post- 
abdominal spines are damaged. However, aculeatus has a deeper 
body; the depth is less than 1.1 in postorbital length, whereas in 
olfersi it is 1.2 or greater. 

Range: This species occurs in abundance in the Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans and is also found in the Indian Ocean. Specimens 
were examined from the following localities: Pacific localities: Japan 
(1), Philippines (1), Galapagos (15), in Pacific off Colombia (1). 
Atlantic localities: Grand Banks (5), off New York (51), off Deleware 
(10), middle North Atlantic (2), off North Carolina (2), off South 
Carolina (1), vicinity of Florida (9), Gulf of Mexico (3), Bahamas 
(1), Cuba and West Indies (9), Burmuda (43), Caribbean (16), off 
Azores (2).

Besides the types, the following lots were studied (the numbers of 
specimens are given in parentheses): USNM 148232(5), 150259(2), 
164295(1). MCZ 34948(4). SIO H52-419(7) andSlO-54-90(l). 
WHOI RHB569(2), RHB475(1). BOC 2708(4), 3006(1), Atlantis 
station 1355(6) ; also uncatalogued at BOC are five lots from off Peru, 
totaling 46 specimens. 

Distinctive characters: Lower preopercular spine directed down- 
ward and sometimes curved a little forward; upper preopercular spine 
rather long, curved outward and sometimes upward, notably rather 
long and reaching past rear of bony edge of preopercle; 2 postabdomi- 
nal spines, directed ventrally, anterior one curved or hooked forward 
or directed straight downward, the angle between these spines varying 
from 50° to 70°; preanal, anal, and subcaudal groups of photophores 
compact, the distance between anal and subcaudal groups less than 
width of last 2 anal photophores; length of exposed part of longest 
spine of dorsal blade 1.0 to 2.2 times in base of soft dorsal fin. 

The lynchus complex of subspecies (lynchus, sladeni, and hawaiensis) 
differs from oljersi mostly in the upper preopercular spine, which is 
short and stubby and docs not extend past the bony preopercular edge 
in oljersi, whereas in the lynchus complex the spine is long, hooked 
outward, sometimes a little dorsally, and reaches past the bony pre- 
opercular edge. 

Although I am recognizing three subspecies of lynchus in the Indo- 
Pacific, I do so with some uncertainty. The character of the height 
of dorsal blade may not be a sound one, as it appears to become pro- 
portionately shorter on large specimens than on small ones of the 
same subspecies. Unfortunately, I lack enough specimens of hawaien- 
sis for a fuller study of this problem. 

The lynchus-sladeni populations also need a detailed study, but 
the number of specimens available to me are not sufficient for an 
analysis of variability. 

Data indicate that three subspecies might be recognized on the 
basis of number of gill raker-, (see table 4, p. 614) and height of dorsal 
blade. These are lynchus lynchus of the Eastern Pacific and At- 
lantic Oceans, lynchus hawaiensis of the Central Pacific, and lynchus 
sladeni of the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, the 
problem of where these so-called subspecies meet in the areas where

I have not seen specimens is unsolved, and all subspecies of the 
lynchus complex of populations may disappear into groups of more 
or less overlapping populations. 

Although the height of the dorsal blade varies considerably from 
specimen to specimen of lynchus lynchus, six measured from the 
Western Atlantic had a shorter blade (1.8 to 2.2 times in base of 
soft dorsal) than those from the Eastern Pacific and South Atlantic 
(1.1 to 1.9 times in base of soft dorsal), but other differences were 
not observed. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
2, p. 592; measurements made are given in table 3, p. 593. 

Range: This subspecies occurs in the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic 
Ocean. I have studied material from: Pacific: Off Panama, 10 
specimens; Galapagos, 9 specimens; off Northern Peru, 49 specimens; 
off Cocos Island, 5 specimens; off Clipperton Island, 7 specimens; 
off Costa Rica, 3 specimens. Atlantic: Off Delaware, 1 specimen; 
Iceland, 1 specimen; Bahamas, 1 specimen; Caribbean Sea, 6 speci- 
mens; Azores, 4 specimens; northwest of Cape Verde Islands, 1 
specimen. 

Depths range down to 2,222 fathoms (USNM 150259).

Genus Sternoptyx Hermann 

Sternoptyx Hermann, Xaturforseher, vol. 16, p. 33, 1781 (type species Sternoptyx 
diaphana Hermann). 

The genus Sternoptyx has the following characters: Abdominal 
vertebrae 11; caudal vertebrae 17 to 20; branched caudal rays 9 + 8; 
pectoral rays 10 or 11; dorsal 9 to 11; anal 13 to 15; gill rakers on 
first gill arch 4 to 7 - 2 to 4 4- 5 to 7 totaling 12 to 16. 

The number of organs in groups of photophores are as follows : 
Abdominal 10, anal 3, branchiostegals 3, isthmus 5, preanal 3, pre- 
opercular 1, preorbital 1, postorbital 1 , subcaudal 4, subopercular 1, 
supra-abdominal none, supra-anal 1, suprapectoral 3. 

The dorsal blade consists of a single enlarged pterygiophore; there 
are no anal pterygiophores between the haemal spines on four of 
the abdominal vertebrae, usually numbers 5 to 8 or 6 to 9, the anal 
pterygiophores being displaced forward. Teeth on edge of maxillary 
directed outward; at origin of anal fin a pair of short spines, two 
pairs of short postabdominal spines in front of pelvic bases; a pair 
of preabdominal spines; preopercular spine single, directed down- 
ward; short spine at lower posterior angle of dentary; postemporal 
ending in a short spine; anterior edge of dorsal blade denticulate. 

Although I have made numerous counts and measurements on 
specimens from the various seas, nothing could be foimd that indicated 
more than a single species for the world. Counts made are given 
in table 1, p. 591, and table 5, next page.

ican station 53(1), 58(1 ). 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
5, p. (117. 

Range: The species is commonly taken at depths of from 100 to 
1,000 fathoms in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, but many 
records exceed 1,000 fathoms. Of SIO numbers H53-371, taken at 
hit. 32°8' N., long. 142°4' E., over the Japan Trench, one specimen 
was taken between the surface and 4,455 fathoms; of SIO H53-307 
taken at lat. 39°34'~23' X., long. 142°29.5'-51' W., one specimen was 
taken between 2,500 and 2,700 fathoms, the latter record being also 
the most northerly latitude for the species in the Pacific. In the At- 
lantic the deepest records are for Oregon station 1273 at 1,600 fathoms 
and Albatross station 2101 (USNM 33563) at 1,686 fathoms. The 
most northerly record for the Atlantic is MCZ 37662 taken at lat. 
42°46' X., long. 63°22' W.

(light organs). 
Acanthopolyipnus Fowler, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, vol. 85, p. 257. L93 I 

(type species Polyipnus fraseri Fowler). 

Species referable to the genus Polyipnus have the following charac- 
ters in common: Abdominal vertebrae 11; caudal vertebrae 21 to 25: 
branched caudal fin rays 9 + 8; pectoral rays ii,10-ii,15; dorsal rays 
11 to 17; anal rays 13 to 19; gill rakers on first gill arch 4 to 10 + 6 to 18. 

The number of organs in groups of photophores are as follows: 
Abdominal 10, anal 4 to 17, branchiostegal 6, isthmus 6, lateral 1, 
preanal 5, preopercular 1, preorbital 1, postorbital 1, subcaudal 4, 
subopercular 1, supra-anal 3 when present, supra-abdominal 3, supra- 
pectoral 3. For the location of the groups of photophores see figure 1. 
p. 588. 

Premaxillary and maxillary finely denticulate teeth pointing out- 
ward and backward; dentition in both jaws in two or three rows; 
dorsal blade represented by a pair of small diverging bony keels end- 
ing in spines at front base of dorsal fin ; posttemporal with one or more 
spines projecting posteriorly, and dorsal ridge of posttemporal may 
bear spines; bony preopercular edge may be spiny and a long or short 
spine occurs at posteroventrai corner of preopercle; ventral odi^v of 
abdomen may be denticulate. In adults spiny ridges may develop 
around anal region and on ventral edge of caudal peduncle; a pair of 
diverging spines at pelvic bases; pectoral shield usually with ventral 
edge denticulate; teeth present on vomer and present or absent on 



MARINE SILVER BATCHETFISHES SCHULTZ 62] 

palatines; the dorsal blade is reduced in i Ins genus to five oj six do; -a I 
pterygiophores, the last one, just in front of dorsal fin base, projects 
as a paired spine. These pterygiophores are not fused into a pro- 
jecting plate in t his genus. 

'The various species of Polyipnus ma\ be distinguished on the basis 
of counts of fin rays, gill rakers, and vertebrae and distribution and 
local ion of gioups of pliol op I lores. Especially import ant are 1 lie posl - 
temporal and preopercular spines, which have unique shapes and 
lengths for nearly every species in the genus. 

Counts made for available species of Polyipnus are given in table l . 
p. 591, and table 6, p. 636; measurements made are given In table 
7, p. 638. An examination of the frequency distributions of the 
various counts indicate significant differences in numbers of vert ebrae, 
gill rakers, and (in rays. 

Four new species of Polyipnus are described as a result of borrow- 
ing specimens, one each from the Eastern Atlantic and Indian Oceans 
and two from Japan. By means of the key below, all known species 
of Polyipnus may be distinguished. 

A. Fraser-Brunner (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., vol. 8, ser. LO, p. 218, 
1931 ) recorded Polyipnus laternatUS from the Atlantic, but he was not 
able to locate the three specimens on which he based his identifica- 
tion. They are probably actually /'. polli (see p. 635).

Description : Measurements made on the holotype and paratype 
are given in table 7, p. 638; counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, 
and table 6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 13, p. 628. 

Range: This species is known from the eastern South Atlantic 
off Anglo, Africa, at a depth of 225 to 510 meters. 

Remarks: This species is most closely related to asteroides and 
laternatus, both known from the Atlantic Ocean. It differs from 
them in having only seven anal photophores, a deeper body, and a 
deeper caudal peduncle, as is shown in the following tabulation:

Polyipnus laternatus Garman 
Figure 14 

Polyipnus laternatus Garman, Mem. Mus. Comp. Zool., vol. 24, pp. 238, 399, 
1899 (off Barbados). — Parr, Bull. Bingham Oceanogr. Coll., vol. 3, art. 7, 
p. 55, fig. 22, 1937 (West Indies).— Schultz, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., vol. 86, 
pp. 142-143, 1938 (West Indies). 

Polyipnus spinosus Brauer (in part), Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Deutschen 
Tiefsee-Expedition auf dem Dampfer Valdivia, vol. 15, pt. 1, p. 121, 1906 
(Atlantic Ocean). — Rivero, Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., vol. 41, No. 4, 
p. 56, 1936 (off Cuba). 

Study material: Because of the large number of lots examined, 
they are summarized as follows : 

Caribbean Sea 8 lots with 17 specimens; off Panama in Atlantic 1 lot, 2 speci- 
mens; off Ilispaniola in Atlantic Ocean 2 lots, 2 specimens; Straits of Florida, off 
Cuba 10 lots, 17 specimens; off Puerto Rico 1 lot, 6 specimens; off Northern 
Florida in Atlantic Ocean 1 lot, 1 specimen; Western Atlantic Ocean 10 lots, 17 
specimens. 

Catalog numbers and number of specimens in parentheses are as 
follows : 

BOC 3755(1) and 3756(1). 

CNHM 64353(1), 64354(2), 64355(2), 64359(5), 64360(2), 64361(6), and

UMML 2751(1). 

USFWS (Brunswick, Georgia) Combat station 450(1). 

USNM 157836(4). 

Distinctive characters: This species is close to asteroides, both 
having three supra-anal photophores; however, laternatus has 10 to 13 
anal photophores instead of 8 to 10, as asteroides has, and the post- 
temporal spine is longer in laternatus, its length equal to the width 
of the last 4 to 7 anal photophores. The last few anal photophores of 
laternatus are smaller than are those of asteroides. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 14, p. 628. 

Range: This species has been taken in the western Atlantic Ocean 
in the West Indies, Caribbean Sea, ofT Barbados, Cuba, and the north 
coast of Hispaniola at depths of from 240 to 1,200 fathoms. I have 
not seen it from the Gulf of Mexico. Specimens observed were be- 
tween 18 and 40 mm. in standard length. 

Remarks: Records in the literature referring to spinosus from the 
Atlantic actually refer to laternatus, as I am unable to find authentic 
specimens of spinosus from the Atlantic.

Study material: USNM 135519, Philippines, off Pescador Island, 
295 fathoms, Albatross station 5190, April 1, 1908, 1 specimen, 33 
mm. The three type specimens were examined. 

Distinctive characters: Little, except number of vertebrae, can 
be added to my 1938 description of this species as only one additional 
specimen is available. It is distinguished by having 11 or 12 dorsal 
rays and 9 to 12 gill rakers on lower part of first arch, fewer than 
occur in other species with 3 supra-anal photophores. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 6,

MARINE SILVER HATCHETFISHES — SCHULTZ 641 

rays, 8 to 10 anal photophores, and a very short posttemporal spine, 
its length equal to width of only 1 or 2 anal photophores. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 16, p. 629. 

Range: This species is known from the Western Atlantic Ocean, 
off the eastern coast of Florida, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, off 
Nicaragua, off Costa Rica, off Puerto Rico, off British Guiana and 
Trinidad at depths of 200 to 600 fathoms. Specimens observed are 
from 19 to 71 mm. in standard length. 

Remarks: Matsubara (Suisan Kenkiu-Shi, Japan, vol. 36, No. 
l,p.2, 1941; Japanese Journ. Ichthy., vol. l,No.3, p. 192, fig. 3, 1950) 
reported P. asteroides from Japan, but when I examined his specimens, 
collected at a later date, I found them to differ from P. asteroides of 
the Western Atlantic; therefore, the Japanese specimens represent a 
distinct species, described immediately below. 

Polyipnus matsubarai, new species

Bay, Japan). — Oshiraa, Hattore H6kokai Kenkiu Shoroku, No. 5, p. 283, 

1938 (Sagami Bay). 

Holotype: USNM 179793 collected by K. Suzuki at Kumanonada* 
Japan, standard length 64 mm. 

Paratypes: Collected with holotype and bearing same data, 3 
specimens, standard lengths 45 to 59 mm., deposited at Kyoto Uni- 
versity, Maizuru, Japan. USNM 179794 collected with the holotype, 
standard length 51.5 mm. 

Description: Measurements made on the holotype and four 
paratypes arc given in table 7, p. 638; the counts made are given in 
table 1, p. 591, and table 6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 17, p. 630. 

Range: This species has been found only in Japanese waters. 

Remarks: This species is most closely related to P. asteroides in 
having about the same number of anal photophores, anal rays, and 
gill rakers, but differs in having only 12 or 13 total dorsal rays instead 
of the 14 to 17 that occur in P. asteroides. In addition the color pat- 
tern of P. matsubarai differs from that of P. asteroides in the wedge 
shaped dark bar a little behind the head being narrow and reaching 
ventrally to the midlengthwise axis of body, whereas in P. asteroid** 
this wedge shaped bar is broad and reaches only halfway to the mid- 
lengthwise axis of bod}^. Behind this dark bar a light or white inter- 



642 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. us 

space reaches to the middorsal line on P. matsubarai but is absent on 
P. asteroides. 

From the other related species matsubarai may be distinguished by 
use of the key to the species of Polyipnus on p. 621. 

Dr. Tamotsu Iwai writes that all of the specimens used in Mat- 
subara's 1941 and 1950 reports were destroyed by fire. 

Since the accounts of Kuroda and of Oshima are in Japanese, Dr. 
Matsubara has kindly translated them for me, as follows: 

Kuroda, N., 1935: On rare fishes contained in Suruga-Wan Marine Biological 
Laboratory. Botony and Zoology 3(4): 830-831. 

Polyipnus stereope Jordan and Starks 
Honen-eso (Japanese name) Sternoptychidae. 
This is the famous luminous fish and the body is roundish in outline. It also 
is called Honen-uo. Several specimens. 

Oshima, M., 1938: Preliminary report on the results of investigation of deep- 
sea fishes obtained from Suruga Bay. Hattori Hokokai Kenkiu Shoroku, (5) : 
281-285. 

Family Sternoptychidae 
Polyipnus sterope Jordan and Starks, Honen-eso 
Locality. Off Yaizu, Shizuoka, Pref., depth 100-200 m. The present species 
has been ascertained as the new species by Jordan and Starks based upon three 
specimens obtained from deep water of Sagami Bay. This species is very rare 
and generally is considered difficult to obtain. Only single specimens have been 
obtained together with luminous shrimps, but this is the new record from Suruga 
Bay. 

Oshima misspelled P. stereope Jordan and Starks. 

This new species is named matsubarai in honor of my esteemed col- 
league, Dr. Kiyomatsu Matsubara, who loaned the specimens for 
study. 

Polyipnus fraseri Fowler 

Figure 18 

Polyipnus fraseri Fowler, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, vol. 85, p. 257, fig. 
19, 1934 (holotype USNM 92324, lat. 12°56'24" N., long. 124°25'24" E., 
Albatross station 5476, and not as published by Fowler). — Schultz, Proc. U.S. 
Nat. Mus., vol. 86, pp. 142, 145, 1938 (Philippines). 

Study material: Only known from the holotype. 

Distinctive characters: This species, along with japonicus, 
has only four anal photophores, fewer than occur in any other species 
in the genus. The posttemporal spine is long and strong, with two 
shorter but strong spines arising basally, and the posterior bony 
edges of both supracleithrum and preopercle are serrated. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 18, p. 630. 

Range: This species is known from the Philippine Islands.

Polyipnus japonicus, new species 

Figure 19 

Holotype: SIO H53-367, Kii Strait, Japan, Oct. 23-24, 1953, 
midwater trawl by S. F. Baird, standard length 12.5 mm. 

Description: Measurements made on the holotype, the only 
known specimen, are given in table 7, p. 638; the counts made are given 
in table 6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 19, p. 631. 

Range: This species is known only from Japan. 

Remarks: This species along with P. fraseri is characterized by 
having only four anal photophores, fewer than any other species of 
Polyipnus. P. japonicus is most closely related to P. fraseri but 
differs from that species as follows : 

The posttemporal spine in P. japonicus is simple, very small, and 
without spines arising from its side or the base whereas the post- 
temporal spine in fraseri is long, strong, and has two strong basal 
spines; the posterior edge of both the supracleithrum and bony prc- 
opecle are serrated in fraseri whereas they are smooth in japonicus ; 
the lower bony edge in both species is serrated. Although there are 
a few minor differences in body proportions between the two species, 
these might result from the great differences in size. The length of 
the posttemporal spine, however, is usually proportionately longer in 
small specimens of Polyipnus than in the larger specimens of the 
same species; hence, I conclude that the spine of japonicus, only 16 
thousandths of the standard length, is significantly shorter than 
that of fraseri, which is 160 thousandths. 

The first two pair of abdominal photophores in fraseri are out of 
line with the others, whereas in japonicus all abdominal photophores 
are in line, as is usual in Polyipnus. I presume the unusual arrange- 
ment of abdominal photophores in fraseri may be an abnormality. 

Radiographs of this species did not show vertebrae clearly to enable 
me to make a count; therefore, this species is not included in table 1. 

The species is named japonicus in reference to the region where the 
holotype was collected.

USNM 135517, Albatross station 5287, lat. 13°37'40" N., long. 
120°39' E., depth 379 fathoms, July 20, 1908, 5 specimens, 26 to 
31 mm. 

Distinctive characters: This species, without the group of supra- 
anal photophores but with 11 to 15 anal ones, has an unusually small 
number of gill rakers (a total of only 10 to 12 on the first arch); the 
posttemporal spine is long, slender, and simple and its length is always 
greater than the diameter of the pupil. The greatest depth is twice 
the standard length. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 20, p. 631. 

Range: This species is known from the Philippines at a depth of 
about 380 fathoms.

Polyipnus spinosus (non Giinther), Gilbert and Cramer, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 
vol. 19, p. 416, 1897 (USNM 47720, Hawaii). 

Study material: USNM 51599, Hawaiian Islands, Pailolo Channel 
between Molokai and Maui, 297 to 306 fathoms, Albatross station 
4088. USNM 47720, Hawaiian Islands, lat. 21°09' N., long. 157°53' 
W., depth 298 fathoms, standard length 41 mm. USNM 177912, 
Hawaiian Islands, Albatross station 1902, 2 specimens, 58 and 60 mm. 
SNHM 8518 (paratypes), Hawaiian Islands, Albatross stations 3867, 
4077, 4090, and 4121, 6 specimens, 37 to 71 mm. 

Distinctive characters: This species lacks the group of supra- 
anal photophores and has a very short but strong posttemporal spine, 
its length shorter than the diameter of the pupil; the gill rakers on 
the first arch total 21 to 24, usually 22 or 23; anal photopores total 
10 to 12, usually 11. 

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 6, 
p. 636. 



MARINE SILVER HATCHETFISHES — SCHULTZ 645 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 21, p. 632. 

Range: This species is known from the Hawaiian Islands; records 
in the literature from other areas are probably for other species. 

Remarks: In 1938 I published USNM 51593 with Albatross station 
No. 4102, an error as far as P. nuttingi is concerned because father 
investigation of USNM 51593 shows that this number belongs to a 
specimen of Antigonia eos and that the correct USNM number is ac- 
tually 51093; this lot is labeled as cotypes of P. nuttingi in Gilbert's 
handwriting in the jar. No Albatross station number, however, was 
found in the jar, and now it appears that when the cotypes were re- 
turned from Stanford University, those from Albatross stations 3867, 
3920, 4089, 4090, 4091, 4097, 4121, and 4134 were all placed in one 
package. To each specimen is attached a small paper tag with a 
number, perhaps corresponding to Gilbert's notes, which I have not 
seen. Later, 2 specimens from this lot were received from the Uni- 
versity of Iowa, and 6 were sent on exchange to the Chicago Natural 
History Museum, a total of 29 specimens now being left.

Polyipnus nuttingi (non Gilbert), Norman, John Murray Expedition, 1933-34, 
Scientific reports, vol. 7, No. 1, p. 20, 1939 (Zanzibar Area). 

Holotype: BMNH 1939.5.24.403, station 115, John Murray Ex- 
pedition Zanzibar Area, depth 640 to 658 meters, standard length 
47 mm. 

Paratypes: BMNH 1939.5.24.404, same data as holotype, 1 
specimen, 38.2. USNM 179897, same data as holotype, 1 specimen, 
46.2 mm. 

Description: Measurements made on the holotype and two para- 
types are given in table 7, p. 638; counts made are given in table 1, 
p. 591, and table 6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 22, p. 632. 

Range: This species is known only from the area of! Zanzibar. 

Remarks: This species is most closely related to P. nuttingi of the 
Hawaiian Islands region. It differs in having 011I3- 20 gill rakers, 
whereas nuttingi has from 21 to 24, usually 22 or 23. Furthermore, 
the distance between the anal and subcaudal groups of photophores 
is notably greater than the width of the subcaudal photophores in 
nuttingi but shorter in indicus, as is indicated in the following tabula- 
tion :

Other differences may have significance too. The caudal peduncle 
is longer and more slender in nuttingi; its length is 160 to 213 thou- 
sandths of standard length, whereas in indicus, it ranges from 138 to 
160. The posttemporal spine of nuttingi is shorter, 49 to 74 thou- 
sandths, whereas in indicus it is 75 to 94 thousandths. The distance 
from occiput to dorsal fin origin in nuttingi is 262 to 300 thousandths 
of standard length, whereas in indicus it is 335 to 349.

Through the courtesy of Dr. Gilbert Whitley and J. W. Evans, 
The Australian Museum, Sydney, I have examined 10 of the cotypes 
of Polyipnus tridentifer McCulloch, Australian Museum Xo. E.3543, 
one of which is 72 mm. standard length and is selected as the lectotype. 
Although these cotypes differ slightly from specimens taken in the 



MARINE SILVER HATCHETFISHES — SCHULTZ 647 

Philippines and Japan, the differences observed do not appear great 
enough to consider them as more than somewhat distinct populations. 
This problem needs more material before a detailed study can be 
undertaken. 

Distinctive characters: This species lacks the group of supra- 
anal photophores; the posttemporal spine is long and slender and 
has 1 or 2 curved smaller basal spines; the dorsally located spine is 
always longer than diameter of the pupil; the anal photophores 
total 13 to 17, rarely 13; and the caudal vertebrae usually total 24. 

Description: Detailed measurements were made on 10 of the 
cotypes of P. trhient'titr, kindly sent for my examination by the 
Australian Museum. The minimum and maximum range of these 
data are expressed in thousandths of the standard length. Standard 
lengths range from 40.3 to 73 mm.; greatest depth 592 to 682; least 
depth caudal peduncle S9 to 104; length of caudal peduncle between 
vortical lines through rear of anal base and base of midcaudal fin 
rays 159 to 191; length of postorbital spine 80 to 174 (this spine 
proportionately longer in small specimens than in larger ones); 
length of preopercular spine 46 to 84; length of head 318 to 302; 
diameter of eye 161 to 183; length from snout tip to rear of maxillary 
236 to 268; width of bony interorbital 70 to 83; snout tip to dorsal 
origin 550 to 600; occiput to dorsal origin 277 to 320; length of dorsal 
fin base 164 to 239; length of anal fin base 233 to 283; distance 
between anal and caudal groups of photophores 4 to 10; width of 
group of caudal photophores. 

Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 6, p. 636. 

Range: This species has been recorded from the Great Australian 
Bight, Moluccas, Andaman Sea. Celebes Sea, Philippines. China 
Sea. Japan and off Cape Morgan and Natal, and South Africa at 
depths of from 37 to 450 fathoms; however, it has been taken most 
frequently at depths of from about 100 to 300 fathoms.

Description: Counts made are given in table 1, p. 591, and table 
6, p. 636. 

Color: The color pattern is shown in figure 24, p. 633. 

Range: This species is known from the Philippines, Celebes Sea, 
Flores Sea, Moluccas, East Indies, Andaman Islands, Bay of Bengal, 
and off Natal to Cape of Good Hope at a depth of from 100 to 303 
fathoms. 

Remarks: There has been much confusion concerning the actual 
speciation and nomenclature of the Polyipnus spinosus complex 
(Schultz, 1938; pp. 141-145: and Okada and Suzuki, Pacific Sci., 
vol. 10, pp. 296-302, 1956). The latter authors have presented a 
clear case that two distinct species of Polyipnus occur in Japanese 
waters. These two species may be distinguished by one having 
a more robust body behind dorsal fin and a deeper caudal peduncle, 
more gill rakers, and more pectoral fin rays. This species is called 
by them P. stereope, whereas the other is referred to as P. spinosus. 

In the U.S. National Museum I have studied this complex of 
species again and now have a much larger series and more experience 
to call on than in 1938. I find that Okada and Suzuki are correct 
in that two species do occur in Japanese waters, but they have in- 
correctly applied the nomenclature. A study of Giinther's drawing 
ol the holotype of P. spinosus indicates a species with a robust caudal 
peduncle and only 13 anal photophores. These two characters are 
present in all specimens from the Philippines having a short post- 
temporal spine like that illustrated for the type of P. spinosus by 
the late J. R. Norman and sent to me in a letter dated April 15, 
1937, and herein reproduced as figure 26b, p. 634. 

In studying the types of P. stereope Jordan and Starks, however, 
I find they too have a robust body, robust caudal peduncle, and only 
13 anal photophores, along with a relatively short posttemporal spine. 
Thus, P. stereope and P. spinosus form a species complex and, by 
means of data presented by Okada and Suzuki along with additional 
data from specimens in the U.S. National Museum, I am able to 



MARINE SILVER HATCHETFI8HES — SCHTJLTZ 649 

distinguish two subspecies: P. spinosus spi7iosus of the Philippines 
and Celebes Sea and P. spinosus stereope of Japan; see also table 6, 
p. 636, which gives counts for these two subspecies. 

This leaves the other species in the complex, the one with a slen- 
der caudal peduncle and longer, more slender posttemporal spine, 
which was thought to be P. spinosus by Okada and Suzuki, but which 
is not that species. 

McCulloch (Zoological (-biological) results of the fishing experi- 
ments carried out by the F.I.S. Endeavour, 1909-1910, vol. 2, pt. 3, 
pp. 78, 87-89, fig. 4, pt. 5, pi. 16, 1914) described P. tridentifer from off 
southern Australia. That species has a more slender caudal peduncle, 
13 to 17 anal photophores, 15 to 18 anal rays, and 12 to 15 pectoral 
rays. These characters are close to those of our large series of spec- 
imens from the Philippines and Celebes Sea and must be considered 
as the P. tridentifer complex. In table 6, the specimens from Japan 
and the Philippines appear not to differ from the Australian tri- 
dentifer sufficiently to indicate subspecific populations. 

The characters recorded by Okada and Suzuki (Pacific Sci., vol. 
10, pp. 298-301, 1956) for their nominal species P. spinosus, such as 
20 to 25 gill rakers, 12 to 14 pectoral rays, a more slender caudal 
peduncle, a long slender posttemporal spine, definitely are characters 
that identify their P. spinosus as actually P. tridentifer.
