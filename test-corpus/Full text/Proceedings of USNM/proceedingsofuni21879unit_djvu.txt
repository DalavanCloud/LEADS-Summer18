NOTTS 0?i TSBE NESTS ANO 1ECC5.6} OF TDIK Fn«EffT NORTH AMEKICAIV 

SI»ECaE§ OF EITIPIOONAC'ES. 

By T. m. BREWEK. 

Ill the following- paper are given the measurements of all the eggs of 
the eight species of Empidonax that are in iha collections of the Smith- 
sonian Institution, and also those in my own, and also a few others. 
Three of these species, E. mininms, ohscwrus, and hamniondi, so f\ir as 
is known, have eggs that are uniformly of an unspotted white. If ever 
spotted, they are so very rarely and so very slightly as hardly to con- 
stitute really an exception. In another species, flaviventris, of which, 
so tar as I am aware, only five or six well-identified sets have been se- 
cured, at least two well-identified sets have been taken that are entirely 
of an unspotted white color, the others being all more or less spotted 
and marked. All the remaining four species, traiUii, acadicus, jiKsilhis, 
and difficiUii, have eggs strongly marked, though, among them all, eggs 
are occasionally found that are of an unspotted white, or marked with 
very minute spottings. In the following brief mention I chiefly con- 
fine myself to the size of each egg, its locality, and the authority for its 
identification, if the record has been preserved. 
Empidonax hammondi, Baiid. 

Four eggs in Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge (:N"o. 1G81), 
from Blue River, Colo., Edwin Carter, measure .02 x .52; .GO x .54; .02

X .52 ; .05 X .50 ; .08 x .50 ; average .08 x .51. The ground-color of these 
three examples is a creamy white, almost a dead white, and they are 
chiefly spotted around the larger end with markings of a brownish red 
and a few faint spots of lavender. The color of the markings of this set 
has no resendjlance whatever to those of 13440 {U. Jfai'ircntri.s) when 
carefully compared.

Spotted with light-brown markings, on a creamy ground, the markings 
being exclusively around the larger end. 

T. M. B. No. 2900. Santa Cruz, Cal. William A.' Cooper. The female 
parent was shot by Mr. Cooper, and was sent to Washington for identi- 
fication. The nest was in a hollow in a bank, covered with roots and 
bushes. Incubation just begun, May 4, 1878. .09 x .50; .69 x .51; .70 
X .52 ; .69 x .52. These four eggs, as indeed nearly all of the eggs of this 
species that I have ever seen, are conspicuously marked with vivid light 
reddish-broA^Ti spots. In three of this set they are chiefly on the larger 
end ; in one the markings are distributed over the whole egg. Ground- 
color a creamy white. 

T. M. B. No. 2959. Nieasio, Marin County, Cal. C. A. Allen. The 
female parent was shot by Mr. xVllen and identified by Mr. Bidgway. 
.70 X .53 ; .70 x .54 ; .05 x .54 ; .70 x .55. Marked with large bright red- 
brown spots, chiefly about the larger end. This nest was also built in 
a cavity. 

T. M. B. No. 2728. Santa Cruz, Cal. Geo. H. Keady. Sent me as 
JE. jiusillus, but evidently a wrong identification. The nest Avas on a 
horizontal sycamore limb, ten feet from the grouiul. .08 x .55 ; .70 x .57 ; 
.70 X .57 ; .08 x .58.

.70 X .55 ; .70 X .55 ; .60 x .55 ; .08 x .52. The last-mentioned cg<^ is of a 
very nearly unspotted white. 

T. M. B. No. 3053. Santa Cruz, Cal. Geo. II. Beady. April 22, 1877. 
Nest on the lower limb, at the extremity, of a sycamore, ten feet above 
the ground. .00 x .52 ; .05 x .53 ; .07 x .53. These eggs are, with hardly 
a doubt, those of -E7. <7/^c?7/.§, though mistaken by Mr. E. for 2)usillus. 
Their ground-color is pure creamy white. The spots are few, small, and 
of a more than usually faint brown, disposed in rings around the larger 
end, the residue of the eg'^ being unspotted. 

In 24 examples, the greatest length is .76, least .65, average .69 ; great- 
est breadth .59, least .50, average .54.

By the kindness of Mr. II. W. Henshaw I am enabled to give the 
measurements of two sets of eggs taken by him near Honey Lake, Cal., in 
the summer of 1878, June 25. The tirst set of three eggs has an un- 
usually i)inkish tinge to the cream-colored ground, and around the larger 
end is a beautiful wreath of markings of a light lilac-brown blending 
with others of reddish brown. These eggs measure .75 x .55; .74 x .58; 
.78 X .59. 

The other set of four eggs have a nearly jiure Avhite ground, and are 
marked around the wider portion of the egg with small red-brown and 
a few lilac-brown spottings of a rounded shape. The rest of each egg, 
including the larger end, has an unspotted surface. One egg has only a 
very few very fine dottings, and is very nearly pnre white. Their meas- 
nrements are .09 x .55 ; .08 x .54 ; .70 x .55 ; .71 x .58. 

All the eggs of this species have a certain family resemblance, which 
it is easy to recognize at sight, but very difficult to describe distinguish- 
ingly. They are all more or less marked with small, rounded spots, 
rarely blotched, and the markings are, some of them, much more minute 
than is usual in any other species. The spots are also scattered more 
about the entire egg, or, if confined, are chiefly on the larger portion of 
the circumference, and never, or certainly rarely, confluent. 

Mr. Henshaw informs me that he has examined at least twenty-five 
nests of this species {piisiUus), and that with only one exception they 
have all been built in willows. The nest before me, taken by Mr. H. 
near Honey Lake, June 25, 1877, is a well- woven structure, made of thin 
strips of the inner bark of deciduous trees, broken bits of dry grasses, 
lichens, &c., and is lined with fine grasses and hair.^ It is pyramidal in 
shape, tapering to a point at the base, and is 4J in external height and 
31 in external breadth. The cavity is two inches deep. It contained 
the set of four eggs referred to above. 

The exception referred to by ]Mr. Henshaw was a nearly completed 
nest of this species, found June 17, that was placed in a crotch of a 
swinging grape-vine. Its structure is said to have been unusually neat 
and firm for a Flycatcher's. (Wheeler's Eeport, 1870, p. 255.)

Smithsonian No. 13440. St. Stephen, N. B. Geo. A. Boardman. 
Parent secured and identification perfect. The nest is small; had been 
built in a low bush; its breadth internally is 1.90 inches, depth 1.25; 
external diameter 3 inches, depth 1.75. It is cojistructed of Hax-like 
fibres, fine shreds of the inner bark of deciduous trees, a few fine 
grasses mingled with feathers, and lined with horse-hair, downy feathers, 
and tine grasses. The eggs measure .75 x .54; .75 x .53; .70 x .55. 
Their original nundjer was four. They have a ground-color of a pure 
white, with blotch-like spots on the larger end, of purplish drab and 
umber-brown, mixed with scattered black markings, but without a tinge 
of red, and are unlike any other eggs of this genus that I have ever 
seen. 

T. M, B. No. 41G. Centre Harbor, N. H. T. M. B. .70 x .50; .74 x

T. M. B. No. 418. Habfax, N. S. Downes. .09 x M. This egg and 
the two others in this set were of a nearly pure chalky white, with a 
few faint spots, so slight as, at first, to be overlooked. The parent se- 
cured and sent with the eggs. I exclude from this list the set secured 
by me in Grand Menan, referred to below, as, although the identifica- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 5 

tion was apparently satisfactoiy, it was not placed beyond donbt by 
securing the parent. The eggs averaged .68 x .03. Neither in size, 
shape, nor in the shade of ground-color, did they at all resemble any 
fresh eggs of E. minimus that I have ever seen. 

In these ten specimens, the greatest length is .70, the least .07, aver- 
age .73; the greatest breadth is .58, the least .53, average .55. 

Since the above was written, my friend Mr. Wm. A. Jeffries has pro- 
cured for me, through the courtesy of Mr. Deane, the measurements of 
the four eggs procured by the latter in Maine, and described by Mr. 
Purdie. These measure .70 x .55; .70 x .55; .05 x .52; .70 x .55, and re- 
duce the average to .72 x .55. The eggs are described by Mr. Jeffries as 
of pure white ground, with markings in two eggs of line dots; in the 
others, small irregular blotches, of a light red-brown, not so deep or so 
bright as in difficUis; mingled with these are a few markings of lilac. 
The ground-color appears to have lost the rosy tint mentioned by Mr. 
P. in the first description, in which, too, no mention is made of the lilac- 
colored spots. 

Through the kindness of Mr. Osborne I have also been enabled to 
examine one of the eggs contained in the nest of this species found by 
him in Grand Menan. It measures ,70 x .50, and agrees exactly with 
the description given by him, except that there is a slight roseate tinge 
in the white ground. The spots are a light reddish brown, and the egg- 
is undistinguishable from several eggs in my collection of E. difficUis. 
It is very different from the eggs identitied by Mr. Boardman. 

Mr. Osborne writes me that none of this set differ more than yf^ in 
their measurements, and that in their color the only points in which any 
differ from the one described are the lighter shade of the ground-color 
and the larger size of the blotches.

.74; tlie greatest breadth .GO, least .52, average .50. The eggs of this 
species uniformly have a groimd-color of a creamy white, or a deep 
cream-color, and when fresli have a slight roseate tinge. In a few in- 
stances the markings are almost, though never wholly, wanting. The 
eggs of this species so closely resemble those of trailUi as to be indis- 
tinguishable; but they may be readily told from those of j>«A'i7?«s. 

Empidonax minimus, Baiid. 

The ground-color of the eggs of this species, as a general ride, is a 
luiiform unsi)otted white, a creamy white when fresh, fading into a dead 
white when long exposed to the light and air. In one set of two eggs, 
both examples are faintly marked with dark or blackish-brown spots. 
In all the other instances I have seen where eggs of this species seemed 
to be spotted, the markings have had rather the api)earance of stains 
than genuine natural characters.

Mr. S. D. Osborne (B. IST. O. C. iii, 187) describes the nest and eggs 
fonnd in a hnmmock of moss on the island of Grand Menan, the parent 
of which was procnred, and was by him identified as E. Jlaviventris. 
" The cavity extended in about two inches, was abont four inches in 
depth, and was lined with a very few fine grasses, black hair-lilcc roots, 
and skins of berries. The eggs, four in number, are white, with a very 
delicate creamy tint, which differs in its intensity in the different speci- 
mens, and are spotted, mostly at the larger end, with a few dots and 
blotches of a light reddish shade." 

Eight days later than Mr. Osborne's discovery, and in a different 
locality, Messrs. Deane and Purdie secured another nest and set of eggs, 
identified as of the same species, in Houlton, Me. This, too, was "in a 
ball of green moss." " The lining was mainly of fine black rootlets, 
with a few pine needles and grass stems." " The eggs, four in number, 
were perfectly fresh, rounded oval in shape, and of a beautiful rosy- 
white tint, well spotted with a light reddish shade of brown." (B. X. 
O. C. iii, 100.) 

Mr. Osborne remarks that " there are several nests of this bird in 
different collections, the identities of most, if not all, of which are dis- 
puted"; and he adds, "the descriptions given by Baird, Brewer and 
Eidgway, agree very well with the nests of the Traill's Flycatcher," »S:c. 
The first clause is so vague as to make it doubtful to what nests he may 
refer. So far as I am aware, prior to 1878 only four or five nests of this 
bird had been i)rocured, and of these three at least are as well and as 
completely identified as are those of either JMr. O.sborne's or Mr. Pur- 
die's. Their authenticity is as indisputable. 

Mr. Piu'die also assumes, " so great is the variation," " that there was 
some error of identification " ; and finally refers the eggs to the Least 
Flycatcher, and cites Mr. Eidgway as authority. But Mr. Eidgway, on

the coutraiy, accepts tliem as genuine eggs of flavivcntris in bis recent 
report (p. o-44), whatever may be tbeir resemblance to those of E. 
minima ; and he so accepts them stilL* In fact, there is no more reason 
Avhy we should reject the identification of these nests and eggs, than for 
our refusing to credit the statements of Messrs. Osborne, Purdie, and 
Ueaue. In either case the identification was complete, and the differ- 
ences in the nest, if of any real moment, tell as much against the one as 
the other. Mr. Boardman's and Mr. Downes's birds were submitted to 
Prof. Baird, and have had his verification in addition. 

In June, 1850, I met with a nest which I then had no doubt belonged 
to this species. It was in a low bush on Grand Menan, near the water. 
My nephew H. E. Storer, then a lad of sixteen, was with me. Both 
parents were seen, and the male was carefully observed through a good 
glass; the female, when first seen, was on the nest; a male, apparentlj' 
its mate, was near by. Unfortunately, in the attempt to secure one of 
the parents, it was missed, and the birds became so wild that neither 
could be secured. We were obliged to leave the island and to take the 
nest without further identification, but we had no doubt as to the iden- 
tity. The eggs were white, not cream-color, more oblong and hirger 
than the average eggs of E. minima. 

A few weeks later, the same year, I received, among other nests and 
eggs, collected near Halifax by Mr. Andrew Downes, two nests and two 
sets of eggs, with the parent of each, of Jlavivenfris. The parents were 
sent to Prof. Baird, and by him identified as E. flariventris. There 
were no notes as to the position of these nests; they were mere collec- 
tions of broken grasses, and it is not improbable they had been built in 
hollow places. There was, at least, nothing to show to the contrary. 
Their autjienticity there is no reason to question. The following sum- 
mer a nest with three eggs and its parent were taken in Centre Harbor, 
two of the eggs being spotted. The same summer Mr. Boardman pro- 
cured the nest, four eggs, and the parent bird referred to above as now 
in the Smithsonian collection. These eggs do not at all correspond, in 
the color of their markings, to the descriptions gi\'en of the sets found 
in 1S7S. 

Entire reliance cannot be placed upon mere differences in the con- 
struction of nests to prove difference of species. However remarkable 
this may bo, it is anything but conclusive. It will be seen that just 
the same differences are noted in the descriptions of the nesting of 
E. (liffwiUs. While two are noted as built in holes in banks, correspond- 
ing with those of the recent examples of Jfaviventris, others were built 
near the extremities of sycamore limbs ten feet from the ground. Mr. 
J. A. Allen (B. K O. C. iii, p. 25) speaks of the E. acadicm building a 
nuich ruder nest than E. minimus, and most probably the specimens 
before him justified his conclusions ; but my experience would lead me 
to reverse their relative positions. In fiict, both of these species vary 
greatly in their architecture, the Acadian most of all, and no one, but 
*But see these Proceedings for 1878, p. 425, footnote. — 11. R.

for liis positive knowledge of tlieir specific identity, could suppose that 
a certain fiat platform-nest of one pair ; the deeply-hollowed nest, with 
its remarkable border of chevaux de fris, of another; and, again, the 
beautiful pensile nest, like a Yireo's, of a third, were all nests of this 
same species acadicus. 

The differences in the color of the eggs identified as those of fari- 
ventris are, i^erhaps, more unusual and remarkable, certainly to their 
extent. Here are two well-identified sets, those from Halifax, of an 
unspotted white ; another set, but slightly spotted ; then Mr. Board- 
man's set, strongly marked, but very differently from the eggs belong- 
ing to the two most recently identified nests. The eggs of hammondi 
and ohscurus are plain white, and no record exists of any spotted ex- 
ample of either. The same is almost equally true of yninimHS. In sixty- 
one eggs, only two are found with even faint spots; but this exception 
may show the possibility of there being more variations than we are 
now aware of. Among the eggs of difficilis a single specimen occurs of 
very nearly unspotted white. The same is true of one egg of E. jnmllus. 
Among the eggs of E. traillU unspotted eggs are comparatively more 
common. Among my eggs of E. acadicus there is also one very nearly 
an unspotted white. So that these variations in nests and m color 
of eggs cannot be received as necessarily conclusive as against such 
positive identifications as those of Mr. Boardman's and Mr. Downes's 
examples. 

If we take the product of the average length multiplied by its aver- 
age breadth at the point of the largest diameter as a proximate test 
of the relative size of the eggs of each species, we find the following 
result : 

Acadicus 4144 

Obscurus 4015 

Traillii 3096 

riaviventris 3900 

Pusillus 3930 

Difficilis 3720 

Hammondi 3328 

Minimus - 3200 

Since the above was in type, Mr. Charles A. Allen of ^^icasio, Cali- 
fornia, has furnished me with some very interesting and apposite notes 
on the nidification of Enipidonax difficilis, demoniiinxtiug the remarkable 
variations that may exist in regard to the position and structure of the 
nests of one and the same species of biixls. After mentioning that he 
has taken and identified some forty or fifty nests of this species, he adds: 
'' I find E. difficilis breeding in all situations. Sometimes I find them 
on the curled root of a tree on the banks of a stream or brook, not over 
six inches above the water; again I find them in the jagged end of some 
half-submerged log in mid-stream; again within the loose V»ark of a 
tree, no matter what kind, nine or more feet up; again I find them in a 



10 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

cavity in some decayed tree or limb, or in any kind of depression that 
gives a base to begin to work on. I also find them in out-honses, or 
bnildings removed from dwellings, on the rafters, or on any spot where 
they can stick their nest. They are also very common under bridges, 
and I have found fonr built in the forks of small trees, some four or live 
feet up. These were all the same veritable E. diffici-Us.^^ 



A JLIST OF EIROIPEAN FISHES HIV THE COI.IL.EC TBON OF THE 

l\^ITEl> STATES NATIOi^'AL JTirSElTlTI. 

By TARI.ETOIV H. BEAN. 

About 350 nominal species are mentioned. Since the list is intended 
simply to facilitate the exchanges between tlie United States National 
Museum and uuiseums iu Europe, no attempt has been made to distrib- 
ute the names in accordance with the latest knowledge concerning the 
classiflcatiou and specific identity of the species iu question. The names 
given to them by those who presented them are, with few exceptions, 
retained. 

One species {Gasferosfeus Blancliardi, Sauvage), which was described 
from specimens sent to Paris fiom Boston, United States, is referred to 
Gasierosteus imngiiius^ Linn. ( := Fygostciis occidcnfaliSj (C & V.) Breevort), 
with which it is identical. 

The numbers at the left are those of the National Museum Catalogiie; 
those at the right were attached to the fishes when they were received.

UESCRIPTIOIV OF A SPECIES OF I^YCODES (I,. PAXII.I.IT.S) OBTAINED 
BV THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION. 

By O. BROWN OOODi: and TARLETOTV H. B£A1V. 

A single specimen of an apparently undescribed species of Lycodes 
was obtained by Capt. Joseph W. Collins and tbc crew of the schooner 
Marion of Gloucester, from the gully between Le Have and Sable Island 
Banks, in latitude 42° 48' N., longitude 63° 07' W., and presented to the 
United States Fish Commission for the National Museum. The speci- 
men, which is 14| inches in length, is in a dilapidated condition, and was 
apparently taken from the stomach of a fish, probably a halibut. Fish- 
ing in this locality is carried on exclusively with trawls or long-lines at 
a depth of 1,200 to 2,400 feet. 

The form of Lycodes imxillus is rounder and more terete than that of 
any other described species. It is also easily distinguished by its very 
short head, by the peculiar curvature of the strong jaw, and by the 
enormous development of the muscles of the cheek. In the small num- 
ber of pectoral rays it resembles L.imlaris Sabine,' X. murama Collett, 
and L. Verrillii Goode & Bean. 

Description. — Body elongate, rounded throughout its entire length; 
its greatest height (.00) equaling its greatest width (.00) j the height 
behind the pectorals (.05i) very slightly greater than the width behind 
the pectorals (.05/j) ; the width at the anus (.04§) exceeding two-thirds 
of the height (.Oog) at the same place; midAvay from the anus to the tail 
the width (.03) equals three-fourths of the height (.04J). The greatest 
height is contained over sixteen times in the total length, and equals 
slightly more than one-fifth of the distance from the snout to the origin 
of the anal fin. The width of the body at the anus is about one- third 
of the length of the head. 

The head much resembles in general form that of the common rattle- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 45 

snake {Crotalus horridus), liaving- a broad flat top and an abrupt, almost 
overliaug'ing, x>rofile at tlie snout; the upper jaw extending far beyond 
the lower (1^ hundredths of length), the intermaxillary teeth being 
visible from below when the jaws are closed. This character, common 
to all species of Lycodes, is extraordinarily prominent in L. paxUlus. The 
end of the maxilla extends behind the perpendicular from the posterior 
margin of the orbit, and the tip of the upper jaw curves strongly down- 
ward. The length of the upper jaw (.083) is contained twelve times in 
the length of the body, and is greater than the postorbital length of the 
head. The tip of the under jaw curves strongly upward, and is received 
entirely within the upper jaw. The distance from the tip of the snout to 
the articulation of the mandible (.10) equals one-third of the distance from 
the snout to the anal, and one-tenth of total length. The muscles of the 
cheeks are enormously developed and protuberant, the width of the 
head in this region (.08) equaling the length of its postorbital portion. 
The width of the interorbital area (.015) is less than half the diameter of 
the orbit (.035), which is equal to half the length of the pectoral fin (.07). 
The eyes are placed high, their upper margins approaching closely to the 
line of its upper profile, their diameter included about four times in the 
length of the head. The nostrils are situated nearly midway between the 
orbit and tlie tip of the snout. 

Intermaxillary teeth in a single series -, a few teeth in a second line 
behind the others, near the symphysis. Mandibular teeth in a single 
series, except at the symphysis, where there are a few (about 9) teeth in 
front of the mam series. A few teeth clustered at the head of the vomer. 
On the palatines a single series, about six on each side. The teeth 
throughout are stouter than is usual in this genus, recurved and sharply 
pointed. 

Dorsal fin inserted at a point less than one-fourth of the distance from 
the snout to the end of the tail, and very slightly behind the perpen- 
dicular from the tip of the extended pectoral. 

Anal fin inserted in the perpendicular from the twelfth dorsal ray, at 
a point three-tenths of the distance from the snout to the end of the tail. 
The vent is in the vertical from the tenth dorsal ray, its distance from 
the snout equaling about four times the length of the pectoral. 

The pectoral is inserted at a distance from the snout about equal to 
twice its own length. 

The ventral is inserted at a distance from the snout equal to six times 
its own length, its tip extending back to the line of insertion of the 
pectoral. 

Scales covering the whole body and extending far out on the bases of 
the dorsal and anal fins; head and pectoral fins scaleless. 

The color was probably light brown in life. 

Kadial formula:— D. (including half of caudal), 116-117. A. (includ- 
ing half of caudal), 100. P., 16. V., 3.

I>ES€RIPTIO:V ©F A NEW SPFX'IES OF I>IPARfS (I.. RAIVrL,A) OB- 
TAINEIB BA' TDSE UNflTED STATES FISH COJIITIISSION OFF HAI^I. 
FAX, NOVA §€OTIA. 

By G. UUOWN GOODE ami TARLETON H. BEAN. 

All apparently midescribed species of Liparis was takeu iu the large 
trawl-net by the collecting* party on the United States steamer Speed- 
well, September 24, 1877, off the month of Halifiix Harbor (Station 117, 
8J miles southeast from Chebncto Head). The depth at which it was 
fonnd was 52 fathoms, the temperature at the bottom 35^ F. The bot- 
tom was of fine sand and mud, and in the same haul of the net were 
taken the following species: GlyptocepMlm cynoglossiis, Jlijipoglossoides 
platessoides, Sehastes marinus (yoimg), PJu/cis cJmss, Aspidophoroldes 
monoptcnjyius, Trujlops PingeUi, Centridcnnichthys nncinatus, and liaia 
radiata. 

The species resembles, in the shape of its head, the Liparis Fahricii 
of Kroyer, but is easily distinguished by its less elongate body and the 
greater number of rays in the dorsal and anal fins. When first taken 



PROCEEDINGS OP UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 47 

it was colorless, almost translucent, and was covered witli a thick tough 
integument. The following description is less complete than would 
seem desirable, owing to the fact that the unique specimen (No. 22,310, 
U. S. ]S"at. Mus. Cat.) was too soft and tender to admit of the requisite 
manipulation. The specimen, which is 50 millimetres in total length 
(caudal included), is a mature female, having in the abdominal cavity 
msiTij large eggs. 

Description. — The body is thick, subcylindrical anteriorly, rapidly 
tapering to the tail, covered with a thick lax integument; its greatest 
height (.25) equals the length Ox" the head and is one-fourth of the total 
length of the body without caudal. 

The head is somewhat tumescent at the nape; its height (over the 
ventral disc and eyes) contained something over six times in the length 
of the body; its greatest width (.18) very slightly greater and equaling 
twice the width of the ventral disc. The snout is broad, with promi- 
nent vertical profile; its length about one-fourth that of the head. The 
cleft of the mouth is horizontal, and does not extend to the perpendicu- 
lar from the anterior margin of the orbit. The lips are covered with 
thick lax skin, the upper jaw extending beyond the lower. 

The length of the upper jaw is about one-third of the length of the 
head; that of the mandible slightly greater than the length of the ven- 
tral disc. Each jaw armed with a band of villiform teeth. The tongue 
is thick, obtuse. The eye is lateral, not interfering with the ui)per pro- 
file of the head; its diameter (.07) more than one-fourth of the length of 
the head, and coutained about fourteen times in the length of the l)ody. 
The width of the interorbital area is contained two and one-half times 
in the length of the head. The nostril is close to the eye. The gill- 
opening is a vertical slit, extending upon the upper part of the root of 
the pectoral. 

The dorsal fin is inserted at a distance from the snout equal to one- 
thiixl of the length of the body. It contains about 48 rays, though to 
count them is almost impossible. The anal fin originates at a distance 
from the snout equal to two-fifths of the length of the body, and in the 
perpendicular from the eighth dorsal ray. It contains at least 48 rays. 
The pectoral fin is moderately broad, with 15 long rays and 12 or 13 
shorter ones. The long rays are twice as long as the ventral disc and 
extend nearly or quite to the perpendicular from the vent. 

The ventral disc is slightly longer (.10) than its distance from the 
snout (.00), which precisely equals its width. It has fourteen papilkT. 

The color is uniform whitish, almost colorless, and translucent in life.

By G. BKOWN OOOfi>E acacl TARILETON H. BEAN. 

The Asrational Museum has recently received, from Mr. Silas Stearus, 
of Peusacola, several species of fishes hitherto unrecorded from the Gulf 
of Mexico. Among them we recognize Seriola honariensis, Cuv. & Yal., 
previouslj^ observed only on the coast of Brazil, which is represented 
by an individual of 890 millimetres, catalogue-number 22258; also a 
second species of the same genus, which, though closely related to two 
Cuban species, has characters which distinguish it from them, or, at 
least, which do not harmonize with the published descriptions. This 
form may in the future prove to be identical with Seriola gujas or Seriola 
duhia ; it appears to be as distinct from either of these species as they 
from each other. It is therefore fully described as a new species under 
the name Seriola StearnsiL AYe prefer thus to place the Pensacola speci- 
men on record as a i>ro visional new species rather than to identify it 
on insutficient giounds with an already-named species, of which the pub- 
lished descriptions are incomplete. A study of a large series of speci- 
mens will doubtless largely reduce the number of species in this genus. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 49 

Seriola Stearnsii, sp. uov. 

A Seriola witli slightly compressed body, tlie height of which (.248) 
is equal to one-fourth of its total length to the end of the middle caudal 
rays, its width (.14) about one-seventh of the same. (The height of the 
body is contained about 4§ times in the length to the end of the middle 
caudal rays.) Its shape sub-fusiform, with greatest height at the origin 
of the second dorsal tin, whence its dorsal and ventral profiles slope 
gently and gracefully, with about the same curve, to the snout and the 
base of the caudal, which are nearly equidistant from the point referred 
to; the circumference of the body (.04) nearly two-thirds of its total 
length ; its height at the ventrals (.22) about five times the length of the 
third dorsal spine ; its least height at the tail (.04) equal to one-sixth its 
greatest height ; the distance from tlie end of the base of the second 
dorsal to the base of the superior caudal lobe (.07) one-half of the great- 
est width of the body. The caudal peduncle is somewhat depressed and 
has prominent transverse grooves above and below and moderate lat- 
eral carina?,, the length of the prominent part of which is somewhat less 
than the length of the pectoral. 

The length of the head (.28) is contained slightly more than 3i times 
in the length of the body and equals twice its own width (.14). The 
length of the snout (.10) is slightly greater than width of interorbital 
area (.095). Length of operculum (.07) slightly greater than half that 
of the upper jaw (.13) and slightly less than that of mandible (.15). The 
maxillary extends to the vertical through the middle of the eye, the man- 
dible to that from its posterior margin. Diameter of eye (.04 J)contained 
about three times in the length of the upper jaw and about 0^ times in 
the length of the head (diameter of iris 7 times in length of head). The 
distance of the eye below the dorsal profile equals about two-thirds of 
its own vertical diameter, which is the same as the greatest width of the 
posterior flange of the maxillary bone. (The centre of the eye is situated 
at a distance below the dorsal profile (.04) contained less than four times 
in the height of the head (.14J) at that point. Oomi)are with S. gigos.) 

Intermaxillary teeth in a villiform band, broadest at the symphysis 
and decreasing in width to the end of the hitermaxillary, which extends 
back nearly as far as the maxillary. Palatine teeth in a club-shaped 
patch, villiform. Vomerine teeth villiform, in an arrow-shaped patch, 
the length of which equals the short diameter of the eye, and its shape 
resembles that of the vomerine patch in Bhomhoplifes. Mandibulary 
teeth similar to those on the intermaxillaries in form and arrangement. 
On the tongue a median and two lateral patches of villiform teeth. 

The distance of the first dorsal from the snout (.35) is slightly more 
than one-third of the length of the body ; the length of its base about 
twice the length of its third spine. Its insertion is over the middle of 
the base of the ventral. The origin of the second dorsal is slightly in 
advance of the middle of the body, or about equidistant from the snout 
Proc. Nat. Mus. 79 4 July 1, 1879. 



50 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

and the grooves on the top of the caudal j^eduncle ; its length of base 
(.42) exceeds twice that of the anal (.20). The first and last dorsal spines 
are extremely inconspicuous, hidden beneath the skin, so that the fish 
at first appears to liave only five spines. The length of the largest 
(third) spine is about equal to the diameter of the eye, and does not ex- 
ceed one-fifth of the height of the body. The height of the second 
dorsal at its longest ray (.10) equals the length of the snout. 

The insertion of the anal is under the middle of the second dorsal, 
and is distant from the snout somewhat more than four times the length 
of the mandible ; its greatest height (.09) is slightly less than the width 
of the interorbital area ; the length of its base (.20) twice that of the 
snout; the length of the last rays (.003) is one-tenth of the distance of 
the snout from the insertion of the fin. 

The caudal is broad, the lobes slender, falcate, equal ; their length (.21) 
about twice the distance from the termination of the median rays to the 
notches on the caudal peduncle (.11). 

The insertion of the pectoral is posterior to the vertical from the origin 
of the first dorsal ; its extremity reaches to the vertical from the poste- 
rior termination of the first dorsal ; its length (.13) is contained less than 
eight times in that of the body and nearly nine times in the distance 
from the snout to the end of the caudal. 

The ventrals are inserted under the origin of the first dorsal, at a 
distance from the snout (.205) equal to twice the length of tlie mandible; 
the length of the fin (.13) equal to that of the pectoral, its extremity 
reaching to the vertical from the insertion of the second dorsal, and to 
a distance in front of the anal equal to the diameter of the eye. 

Radial formula : B. VII; D. VII, 1, 30; A. II, 1, 19; P. 19; V. 6. 

Scales small, as in other members of the genus, present upon the 
cheeks, but not upon the limb of the preoperculum or the remainder of 
the head. Lateral line with many curves, straight upon the tail. 

Color bluish above, whitish beneath, a band of greenish yellow as 
wide as the eye extending from the i>reopercle to the extremity of the 
tail. Fins greenish ; traces of bands on the operculum. 

The specimen sent by Mr. Stearns (Xo. 22325) measures 5G8 millime- 
tres {20^ inches) to the end of the middle caudal rays, and weighs C^ 
l)Ounds. Concerning the species, Mr. Stearns writes: "a^o. IIG is 
called here by the fishermen 'Amber fish,' and is quite common along this 
coast in the deeper waters, but as they do not bite freely, not many are 
taken. Those that are caught are taken near the surface, as the hook 
is descending. Throughout the year they are found near the coast, 
where they probably breed. The specimen sent is rather below the 
average size. By most people it is considered a fine food fish." 

The name "Amber fish" is applied to the fishes of this genus by Eng- 
lish-speaking colonies the world over. It alludes to the amber-colored 
stripe upon the side.

ON THE BIRDS OF HEldaOKiAND. 

By H. GATKE. 

Heligoland, Marcli 8, 1870. 
Professor S. F. Baird, 

Secretary Smithsonian Institution : 
Dear Sir : I have delayed answeriug your very kind communication 
till I miglit be able to inform you of the receipt of the box despatched 



52 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

for me. It arrived two days ago, and many, many thanks for tlie con- 
tents thereof, wiiicli to me are very valnable indeed. 

By this mail I shall send ofl" a small box with skins, all I had, and, as 
I fear, of very little valne to yon. Perhaps the snite of Sylvia suecica, 
Linn., may interest you, as the females and male in winter dress are 
jterfectly reliable. The other form, iS. leucocycmea, Brehm, comes very 
rarely so far north as Heligoland, and the few instances it has turned 
up from four to six weeks earlier than the siiecica in spring. I have sent 
for your examination a skin of Lanius major, Pall., Avith the alar white 
mark extending over the bases of primaries only, and which I suppose, 
from what I see in Richardson and Swainson's " Faun. Bor. Amer.," is 
coincident with their Lan. horcalis.* Perhaps we have here to deal 
with a case similar to that of Alavda alpestris, viz, a gradual extension 
westward from an originally American home. Up to October, 1847, A- 
aJpestris was here an excessively rare appearance, known only to a very 
few sportsmen; but at the fall of that year there Avas a very great influx 
of birds from the east {Xema sahinii may be counted among the rest), 
and with'these A. alpestris appeared in such numbers that one young- 
man succeeded in shooting above a score during one afternoon. Ever 
since, this species has been a numerous and regular bird of passage dur- 
ing October and November of each successive year. I have packed for 
you a male and female, which, as coming from the westernmost point

a region be deprived of its spring birds" proves very strikingly tbe fact 
that over a wide range of latitude each individual resorts for propaga- 
tion to the latitude where it was hatched ; that birds quit their winter- 
quarters in succession as their individually more northerly home becomes 
habitable, — naturally the most northerly latest; and that, consequently, 
Middendorf s calculation of the rate of migratiou-tiight must be falla- 
cious, because the individuals he observed earlier in spring at a lower 
latitude were not the same he saw later not thirty degrees higher north, 
bat were such as i^assed over the former, wdiilst they perhaps were be- 
ginning to construct their nests; therefore, the period that lay between 
observing the two could not be made use of as a measure whereby to 
determine their pace of flight or advance during a day. 

That the direction of the course of wandering birds should be influ- 
enced by river courses or mountain chains, is a point which I do not 
agree to, at least so far as Europe comes under contemplation. Here 
during the fall, the route of miscellaneous sjiecies is so varied that the 
two principal hosts cross each other at right angles ; one great mass 
jirogressing due west from the farthest east of Asia (e. g., Anthus ricJi- 
ardi, Sylvia superciliosa), and continue their course to Heligoland, Eng- 
land, France, and Spain. Besides these, all the rare autumnal visitors 
come here from the far east of Asia, which proves that there must be 
with birds of these regions a strong inherent tendency to a western mi- 
gration, even in species whose real winter-quarters are in the south of 
India down to the Sunda Isles, as, for instance, the two named above. 
This line of flight diverges abruptly to the north when approaching 
the Atlantic in England, Western France, and Spain ; vide the immense 
numbers crossing the Straits of Gibraltar. 

This westerly current is cut at right angles by another host coming 
simultaneously down from the extreme north of Europe and Asia, and 
steering due south for their winter-quarters, viz : The Willow Warblers, 
PhyUoscopus frocMlus and VKfus, which go from the Xorth (Jape of Scan- 
dinavia to the Cape of Good Hope ; P. tristis and horealis, from Northern 
European and Asiatic Paissia down to the south of India and China. 
The latter, together with Faico rnfipes, Motacilla cifreola, Anthus cervinns, 
Emheriza aureola^ and Limosa cinerea, all plentifully breeding so close to 
Heligoland as the Onega Dvina, Megin, and Petchora distiicts, but still 
never, or very rarely, turning up here during their autumnal flights, 
proves in itself their southern course — without the least western incli- 
nation—even if they were not observed down the Ural, the Black Sea, 
Turkestan, &c. The most striking instance of such a move is seen in 
Sylvia pMlomela, which breeds in the south of Sweden, and, neverthe- 
less, has been observed here but once during the last forty years! 

A few can be pointed out as going from northeast to southwest, 
. namely, Sylvia suecica and the Alauda alpestris. These, and all the oth- 
ers enumerated, joined by hosts of the more common " million " which 
are spread far and wide over the entire northern Palteartic Begion. 



54 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Wliat, imder .such circimLstimces, becomes of tlie routes of birds by 
river courses or uiouutaius! IIo^v mauy great rivers has Anthns rich- 
ariU to cross, ahuost all at right angles, during his autumnal flight from 
Baouria to France and Spain ? 

I maintain that the migratorial movement, jiarticularly the vernal one, 
when in normal progress, is performed by the great majority of birds 
far beyond the perception of man, and that what we see of the same 
are but the irregularities and interruptions thereof— brought about by 
atmospheric agencies. 

Your opinion that the spring line of flight is widely different from 
that of the fall, I most completely participate in. All the different 
routes enumerated in the foregoing are dropped, and a more or less 
direct course toward the polar regions adopted. The wide front of the 
winter-quarters, extending from the west of Africa to the east of China, 
the Philippines, Borneo, «&;c., concentrating during this northerly pass- 
age to less than half its original stretch. 

A proof of this latter assertion is rendered by the fact that of all 
the eastern birds which visit Heligoland during their autumnal migra- 
tion, none appear during their return journey, the track to the south 
Avhich terminated their w^estern flight having brought them to far lower 
latitudes ; while in spring, as they pursue a direct course to their nortli- 
ern breeding-grounds, they leave all these western countries to their 
left. 

While the " rare birds" here during autumn are, without exception, 
eastern species, those of the spring are as uniformly from the southeast — 
Greece, Asia Minor, Turkestan, &c. Singular it is, that almost no ex- 
ceptional bird has come here from the south or west, i. c, so far as the 
Old World is concerned. In what eminent manner the "far west" is 
represented, I have told you at an earlier period. 

And this leads me to the route which American birds follow to Eu- 
rope. I do not much lean to the supposition that storms have in any 
considerable degree to do with such extra tours, and why N^ewtou and 
others advance so strongly the Greenland, Iceland, &c., route, I cannot 
comprehend. I fancy they never coutemplated the possibility of a bird 
coming in a direct line from IS^eAvfouudland to Ireland ; in other words, 
that a bird might be able to sustain an uninterrupted flight sufQcient 
to carry it across the Atlantic. My researches have led me to the be- 
lief that such is not alone far from being impossible, but that the proba- 
bility of such a fact, wonderful as it may appear, is borne out by good 
evidence. 

For instance, these old spring birds of these Si/lvia sueeica whicli I 
send you, have wintered in the middle or north of Africa. During their 
vernal migration, the first point north thereof where they are regularly 
found in considerable numbers is Heligohmd, whilst during this tune 
they are of the utmost rarity in all countries intervening between the 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 65 

Mediterranean and the I^ortli Sea, npper Germany not excepted. This 
fact incontestably i^roves that these birds cross this distance in one un- 
interrupted flight, and during- one short spring night, viz, in to 10 
houi^s, which gives a rate of locomotion of 40 geographical miles per 
hour. Wonderful, incomprehensible, I admit, but still remaining a fact. 
The slow clumsy Eoyston Crow {Corvus comix) crosses from here due 
west* over to England, at a rate of 27 geographical miles an hour, and 
results of 25 miles have been furnished by the semi-domesticated Carrier- 
pigeon. The distance from the north of Africa to Heligoland is equiva- 
lent to that from Newfoundland to Iceland, and therefore no objection 
whatever can be raised against your birds crossing over to us direct. 

All this with plenty of evidence, and a gxeat many points besides, is 
ready in manuscript sufficient to cover from fifty to sixty pages octavo 
print, and by the end of May I shall be ready for the press altogether. 

I greatly count on your lenience, my dear sir, whilst allowing my pen 
to run on at such an unpardonable length, but perceiving from your 
contribution that you, like myself, have studied the grand tbeme of the 
migration in nature, which is quite a different matter froui all learned 
treatises thereon worked out by the lamp of the studio, my hobby felt 
so comfortable in your genial company that it bolted oft* with this un- 
resisting tide. 

Begging once more to pardon my having ventured on your time and 
patience at such uni)ardonable length, in more or less objectionable 
English thereto, 

I remain, dear sir, yours, very truly,

DiAGTv^osis. — Bodj- comi3aratively elongate, somewhat compressed, its 
greatest height, at a point midway between pectorals and A^entral inser- 
tions, contained 5^- times in its length to the origin of the middle caudal 
rays, its greatest width equal to one-tenth of total length, the least 
height of tail contained 11 times in length of body. 

Scales large, thin, oblong, triangular at the free end, those at the 
base of the anal fin having the free end more produced than the others. 
Sixty-five scales in the lateral line, seven rows between it and the origin 
of the dorsal, eleven between that of the anal and the lateral line. Scales 
extend for a short distance upon the bases of the dorsal and anal fins. 

Head moderately compressed, snout subconical, the lower jaw in- 
cluded within the jipper when the mouth is closed. The length of the 
head is contained 4i times in length of body, slightly exceeding twice 
the length of the lower jaw. Width of the head equal to the length of 
the operculum and very slightly less than that of the upper jaw. Width 
of interorbital area half of the least height of tail. Length of snout 
half that of the mandible, which is one-ninth of the total length. Diam-

OIV THE SPECIES OF ASTKOSCOPr.S OF THE EASTERN UMTEH 

STATES. 

By TAKI.ETON IS. BEAN. 

The family TJranoscopidiv of Gill has two representatives on the east 
coast of the United States, Astroscopus y-(jrwctim (0. & V.) Gill, and A. 
anoplus (C. & V.) Brevoort. The former was described from the Carib- 
bean Sea, and is now for the first time recorded in our waters. A. cino- 
plus was founded npon young individuals sent by Professor LeConte, 
and the immaturity of the specimens has led to considerable confusion 
in the diagnoses of genera. Cuvier and Valenciennes supposed the spe- 
cies to be scaleless. Brs. Gill and Giinther both employed this as one 
of the characters separating it from Uranoscoims, the latter in 18G0* 
assigning the U. anoplos of Cuvier and Valenciennes to his new genus,

Agnus, with the distinguisbiug characters of a naked body and the ab- 
seuce of a mament hi the mouth. Dr. Oill, in 1861,* used the same 
characters in transferring the same species from TJranoscopus to Astro- 
scopus of Brevoort, adding some particuhirs as to the mailing of the head 
and the armature of the preopercuhim. The species, in tact, is covered 
with scales, which in the young are inconspicuous, hut in the adult 
may be readily counted. The genus Astroscojms, however, is well sep- 
arated from Uranoscoptts, and may be thus defined :

There are now two specimens of this species in the National Museum, 
one (No. 18011) taken in the Saint John's Ptiver, Florida, by Prof. S. F. 
Baird, April 2, 1877 •, the other (No. 18029) collected in the I\Iatanzas 
Kiver Inlet, Florida, by Mr. Joseph C. Willetts, in February, 1877. In 
a collection of color-sketches of fishes made for Prof. Louis Agassiz, and 
now lent by the Museum of Comparative Zoology to the National 
Museum, are illustrations of A. y-grwciim from Hampton Koads, Va., 
Charleston, S. C, and Pensacola, Fla. 

Description.— The greatest height of the body (.26) equals twice the 
length of the operculum (.13). Its greatest width (.21) equals tlie height 
at the ventrals (.21), and the distance of the ventrals from the snout 
(.21). The least height of the tail (.10) is contained 10 times in the total 
length, and equals the distance between the eyes (.10). The length of 
the caudal peduncle (.08) equals that of the last anal ray (.08), and is 
contained 12.J times in the total len gth.

t These are present in Uranoscopus scaler and TJ. anper, and probably in all species of 
TJmmscopus. I am not aware that this has been previously mentioned. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 59 

The greatest lengtli of the head (.37) slightly- exceeds the distance of 
the spinous dorsal from the snout (.30). The length of the postocular 
depression (.11) equals more than 3 times the length of the snout (.03A), 
and is contained about 9 times in the total length. The width of this 
depression (.07^) equals about f of its length. The greatest width of 
the head (.28) equals 4 times the length of the second dorsal spine (.07). 
The jaws are shorter than in A. ayioplns. The length of iha ujiper (.15i) 
equals half the length of the anal base (.31), and is contained 0^ times 
in the total length (less than 6 times in A. anoplus). The length of the 
mandible (.21) is contained 4| times in the total length. The maxilla 
extends to a perpendicular, drawn at a distance behind the eye equal to 
the short diameter of the eye, and the mandible ends in the same ver- 
tical. The long diameter of the eye (.03) equals half the length of the 
last ray of the second dorsal (.00). 

The distance of the spinous dorsal from the snout (.30) is a little less 
than the greatest length of the head (.37). The length of its base (.11) 
is contained 9 times in the total length, and equals the length of the 
postocular depression. The spines are all longer than in A. ano2>his. 
The length of the first (.07i) is nearly ^ the length of the upper jaw, and 
slightly exceeds that of the second (.07), which equals ^- of the length of 
the mandible. The last spine (.02.^) is ^ as long as the first. The length 
of the base of the second dorsal (.30) is contained 3.^ times in the total 
length, and equals 3 times the distance between the eyes. Its longest 
ray (.10^) equals somewhat more than half the length of the head (much 
less than half in A. anoplus). The length of the last ray (.00) equals the 
distance from the snout to the orbit (.00). 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.57) equals nearly 3 times the 
length of the longest dorsal ray. Its length of base (.31) is almost equal 
to that of the second dorsal. The first ray (.04) is half as long as the 
last (.08); the longest (.14i) is contained nearly 4 times in the distance 
from the snout to the origin of the anal, and nearly 7 times in the total 
length. 

The length of the middle caudal rays (.25) equals '^ of the total length. 
The length of the external rays (.23) equals that of the ventral (.23). 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.35i) equals 5 times the 
length of the second dorsal sphie. Its length (.30i) equals 5 times that 
of the last dorsal ray. It extends to the fourth anal ray. 

The distance of the ventral from the snout (.24) does not greatly ex- 
ceed its length (.23), and is equal to the height of the body at the ven- 
trals (.24). The ventral extends to about the origin of the spinous dor- 
sal. The vent is under the anterior rays of the second dorsal.

Description. — The shape of the body is similar to that of Urano- 
Scopus scaber. Its greatest height (.29), which is at the origin of the 
spinous dorsal, is contained 4 times in its length in the young* and 3J 
times in the adult. The greatest width of body (.24^) is nearly ^ of the 
length, and equals the length of the ventral (.24i). The height at the 
ventrals (.27) equals three times the distance from the snout to the cen- 
tre of the eye (.09). The least height of the tail (.11) equals the width 
of the interorbital area (.11), and is contained 9 times in the total length. 

The length of the head (.39) equals 3 times the length of the opercu- 
lum (.13). There are two postocular depressions, whose length (.OTA) 
equals their width (.07^), or slightly less than twice the length of the 
snout (.04). The greatest width of the head (.31) equals nearly 3 times 
the least height of the tail. The length of the upper jaw (.17) is con- 
tained nearly times, and of the mandible (.23) 4J times in the total 
length. The long diameter of the eye (.03^) equals | the length of the 
longest anal ray (.14), and -fV of the length of the head. 

The distance of the spinous dorsal from the snout is about f of the 
total length. The length of its base (.12) equals twice the length of its 
first spine (.0(3). The spines are all shorter than in A. y-grcccum. The 
second spine equals the first, and 3 times the last (.02). The length of 
the base of the second dorsal (.30) equals times the length of its last 
ray (.05). The first ray equals the first spine in length. The longest 
ray (.IG^) is contained G times in the total length. 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.GO) equals twice the length 
of the second dorsal base (.30), and nearly twice the length of the anal 
base (.31). The first anal ray (.04) equals the snout in length. The 
longest (.14) slightly exceeds in length the operculum, while the last 
(.07j^-) about equals the length of the postocular depression. 

The length of the middle caudal rays (.23-?r) is usually a little less than 
that of the ventral (.241). 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.36) equals 3 times the 
length of the base of the spinous dorsal. The length of the pectoral 
(.29) exceeds the length of the ventral (.24^) by about \ of the length of 
the latter, and is contained nearly 3^ times in the total length. It ex- 
tends to the 5th anal ray.

OIV THE OCC'UKKFNCE OF HIPl»OC;t,OSSlTS VUI^CJARIS, Ft,EM., AT 
UNALASHKA AND ST. MICHAEL'S, AJLASKA. 

By TARLETOW H. BEAN. 

:N"o one lias yet positively identified the halibut of the Pacific coast oi 
Xorth America with the Hiiyiyoglossus vulgaris of Fleming, so far as I 
can learn. Ayres, in 1854,* writing of the species observed in the 
market of San Francisco, says : " The great Bippoglossus vulgaris, uni- 
versally known as the ' halibut,' the fishermen have assured me is some- 
times caught near the Farallon Islands. Most of those sold in our 
market, however, if not all, are brought from the coast further north." 
In volume 2 of the same Proceedings (1859, p. 30), he writes: "Another 
species, in which the eyes are on the right side, is occasionally taken 
near the Farallon Islands, opposite the mouth of the Bay, which I do not 
feel warranted in separating from H. vulgaris, without a direct compari- 
son of the two. Its fin-rays are D. 102, A. 73, P. 16, V. G, C. 4, 1, 7, 8, 
1,4. 

" It appears to be seldom quite as large as H. calif ornicus:^ 

The number of anal rays in this enumeration is smaller than usual, but 
not improbable. 

Lord t gives a graphic account of the Indian mode of fishing for 
halibut, and remarks as to the species : " I believe the species to be 
the Pleuronectes liipiwglossus of Linnceus, but of this I am by no means 
perlectly clear, as I had only an opportunity of examining this single 
specimen, that I estimated as weighing over 300 lbs.; and it was quite 
impossible to investigate its specific character," &c. 

*Pioc. Cal. Acad. Sci., i, 1854, Ist ed., p. 41, and2d ed., p. 40. 

\ Naturalist in Vancouver Island and British Columbia, i, 18GG, p. 149. 



64 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Dr. Cooper, in mentioning- the Pleuronectoids of California, says:* 
" The two tirst are species of Halibut, one closely resembling the Atlan- 
tic fish, and grow over 4 feet long, the latter (No. 105, H. vulgaris f) 
sometimes weighing five hundred or six hundred pounds. Both are 
caught near San Francisco." 

Mr. William H. Dall, iii his work on "Alaska and its Resources," 1870, 
p. 484, states, that "The halibut are smaller than those of the eastern 
fisheries, but near Sitka and along the coast they have been taken from 
three to five hundred pounds in weight. They are not found north of 
the ice line in Bering sea, except, perhaps, in summer." In the report 
for 1870 of the Commissioner of Agriculture, p. 381, the same author 
employs the name ^^ B Ippoglossns vulgaris f^^ in connection with the para- 
graph on the lialibut, and states that "Their range is from the Aleutian 
Islands southwest to Cape Flattery. . . . They extend westward into 
the Ochotsk sea vfith the cod and already form an article of commerce 
among the west-coast fishermen. They are said to surpass the eastern 
lialibut in flavor when properly cured." 

Mr. Henry W. Elliott, special agent of the Treasury Department, 
speaks tlius of tlie halibut in a Report upon the Condition of Afi'airs in 
tlie Territory of Alaska, Washington, 1875, p. 1G7 : 

"Found throughout the territory on soundings south of the GOth 
parallel of north latitude. Halibut are quite abundant and of excellent 
quality, but the climate is such that the fishermen cannot properly dry 
or cure them for exportation even in small cargoes. They are, however, 
not abundaut enough for exportation, and must therefore be regarded 
as only of local importance." 

In a report upon the Customs District, Public Service, and Resources 
of Alaslva Territory by William Gouverneur Morris, special agent of the 
Treasury Department, 1879, p. 115, is found the following information: 

" While I was at Klawack, they were testing the boiler, new machinery, 
and otlier apparatus, and were trying the experiment of canning clams 
and halibut, both of which are so plenteous in that neighborhood as to 
be a perfect drug. I have since seen the result of this, and can pronounce 
the clams the very best so treated on the whole Pacific coast, and the 
halibut is of superior quality, preserving its flavor better than any yet 
produced from any other locality. The supply of these two articles of 
commerce alone, from this particular place, is only to be regulated by 
the demand." 

The only examples of the Pacific halibut in the United States Na- 
tional Museum are those collected by Mr. W. H. Dall and Mr. Lucien 
M. Turner. Mr. Dall's is the single available one for comparison, and 
that lacks the caudal fin, which is fortunately present in the other. Al- 
though both specimens are in very poor condition, there is no difiiculty 
in perceiving their identity with the Atlantic halibut. The individual 
forwarded by Mr. Dall (collector's number 1098, museum number 22*66) 

' *Crouise's Nat. Wealth C»l., 1868, p. 493. 



^ PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 65 

was taken at TJnalaslilai, September 13, 1S73, in 50 or GO fathoms. Mr. 
Dall informed me that Dr. Steindachner saw it in San Francisco, and 
considered it identical with the Hipjyoglossus vulgaris. I have compared 
it carefully with Atlantic halibut from Eastport, Me., and fail to see 
any means of separating the two. The Alaska individuals are a little 
thicker ; but that may be accounted for by the differences in the food 
supply. It is very desirable to have perfect specimens of the Pacific 
fish for examination ; but, in the absence of such material, I have en- 
deavored to make the most of what the museum has, and it is believed 
that the table of measurements will serve to confirm the \iews of those 
who regard the halibut of the Pacific identical with that of the Atlantic. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE UNALASHKA SPECIMEN. 

The museum catalogue number is 22466, and the collector's number 
1098. The length of the fish to the origin, of the middle caudal rays is 
463 millimetres. The different proportions of the body are given in 
hundredths of this length. 

The greatest height of the body (.32) is 4 times the length of the oper- 
culum (.08) ; its height at the ventrals (.25) is contained 4 times in the 
total length, and equals the distance of the pectoral from the snout 
(.25). The least height of the tail (.07^) is nearly equal to the length of 
the operculum (.08), and to the distance of the dorsal from the snout 
(.08). The length of the caudal peduncle (.12) equals that of the longest 
anal ray (.12). The lateral line follows the same c6urse as in Eastern 
specimens. 

The greatest length of the head (.25|) is contained nearly 4 times in 
the total length. The distance between the eyes (.03) equals ^ the dis- 
tance from the snout to the orbit (.06). The length of the snout (.041) 
equals almost i the length of the upper jaw (.01)^). The lengtli of tlie 
upper jaw is not quite equal to that of the pectoral of the blind side 
(.10). The maxilla extends to the vertical thrpugh the middle of the 
lower eye. 

The length of the mandible (.11^) is contained 2J times in the length 
of the head. It extends to the vertical through the posterior margin 
of the lower eye. 

The long diameter of the upper eye (.05) is contained 5 times in the 
length of the head, and twice in that of the pectoral of the blind side. 
The teeth agree perfectly in all respects with those of the Eastport in- 
dividuals, that is, they are arranged in two series in the upper jaw, the 
outer being the stronger, and in a single series in the lower jaw. 

The distance of the dorsal from the snout (.08) equals the length of 
the operculum. Its longest ray (.11^-) does not quite equal the longest 
of the anal (.12). The 37th and 38th dorsal rays are the longest. 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.34) equals f of the head's 
length. Its longest ray, the 17th, (.12) is contained 8J times in the total 
length.

Tlie tail is wanting in tliis individual, but present in that forwarded 
by Mr. Turner. It is of tbe usual vulgaris type. 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout(.25) equals twice the length 
of the iDCctoral of the eyed side (.12^) and 2^ times that of the blind side 
(.10).

I>ESCRHI»TI©IV OF ATV APPARENTIiY NEW SPKCIE8 OF «-ASTEU- 

OSTEUS (G. ATfCINSai) FROM THE St!MOO»a€ ILAECES, MABNE. 

By TARI.ETOIV H. BEAM. 

In a large collection of fishes sent to the United States National Mu- 
seum, in 1878, by Mr. C. Gr. Atkins, an assistant of the United States 
Fish Commission, were six specimens of a stickleback which appears to 
be undescribed, and for which I j^ropose the name given above, as a 
slight recognition of Mr. Atkins's services as a collector and as an orig- 
inal investigator into the rei)roductive habits of imiiortant fishes. 

Gasterosteus AtMnsii resembles in form and coloration G. pungitius 
rather than the perhaps more closely related G. aculeatus. It may be at 
once distinguished from all the other eastern American species by (1) 
the presence of abont fitteen lateral plates, which rapidly diminish in 
size after the fonrtli, and (2) its long ventral spines, which nearly or 
quite reach the vent. The plates are quite unlike those of G. semiarma- 
ti(S, being so thin and posteriorly so small that they are inconspicuous. 

For the purpose of description I have selected the individual whose 
catalogue-number is 22492 a (collector's number, 3013). The extreme 
length of this specimen is 35 millimetres, and its length to the origin of 
the middle caudal rays is 30 millimetres, which is the basis of compari- 
son for all the other measurements. 

The height of the body at the ventrals (.21) equals 3 times the length 
of the npper jaw (.07), and 3 times the distance between the eyes (.07). 
Its greatest width (.11) equals the long diameter of the orbit (.11). The 
least height of the tail (.04) equals the length of the antecedent anal 
spine (.04) and one-half the length of the snout (.08). The length of the 
caudal peduncle (.13) somewhat exceeds the width of the head (.12). 

The length of the head (.31) equals 3 times the length of the mandi- 
ble (.10). The length of the snout equals that of the operculum (.08). 
The length of the upper jaw (.07) equals the distance between the eyes 
and one-half the length of the post-pectoral plate (.14). The length of 
the mandible (.10) is contained 10 times in the total length and equals 
twice the length of the antecedent spine of the second dorsal (.05). The 
long diameter of the orbit is contained 2f times in the length of the 
head and 9 times in the total length. 

The teeth are as in the other members of the family. 

The spinous dorsal has two spines of equal length. Its distance from 
the snout (.37) equals shghtly more than twice the length of the pecto- 
ral (.18). The length of the two spines (.12) equals that of the first and 
longest ray of the second dorsal (.12) and of the anal (.12). The spines 
are in a straight line, and with each is connected a delicate membrane. 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.06) equals 6 times the long 
diameter of the orbit. Its length of base (.18) equals 2J times the length 
of the operculum. The length of the anecedent anal spine (.04) is con- 
tained 3 times in that of the first and longest ray (.12). 



68 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Tlie length of the middle caudal rays (.16|) is contained G times in 
the total length. 

The caudal is slightly forked, almost trimcate when expanded. 

The pectoral is composed of ten rays. Its distance from the snout 
(.34) is a little less than twice its length (.18). It extends to the mid- 
dle of the interval between the two dorsals. The length of the post-pec- 
toral plate (.14) equals twice that of the upper jaw, and its width (.04) 
equals the length of the antecedent anal spine. 

The ventral consists of one spine and one ray. Its distance from 
the snout (.45) equals 4 J times the length of the lower jaw. The 
spine extends beyond the end of the pubic bones, reaching almost or 
quite to the vent. Its length (.19) exceeds that of the pectoral (.18). 
It is very strongly serrated on its outer and finely on its inner margin. 
The origin of the \'entral is slightly in advance of the perpendicular let 
fall from the second dorsal spine. 

Eadial formula: B. Ill; D. II, I, 10-12; A. I, 8-9; C, + 12 +; P. 
10 ; V. I, 1. 

Color. — Dark bands cross the body just as in G. pungitius, which it 
strongly resembles. The ground-color of the body in the alcoholic speci- 
mens is almost flesh-color ; the major i^art of the head is silvery, as are 
the breast and the belly.

REVIEW OF THE I»i:.E«JK©lVEC1fB5iE OF SAN FRANCISCO. 

By \Y. N. LOCKINGTOJV. 

The PJeuronectidcc of the Pacific Coast have been described by Girard 
(Proc. Acad. :N^at. Sci. Phil. VII, 1854 ; VIII, 185G ; and PaC. Eail. Rep. 
Vol. X, 145-156), by Ayies (Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci. 1855, Vol. I, 40, and 
Vol. II, 1859, 29-30), by Giinther (Cat. Fish. Brit. Mus. Vol. IV, 18G2, 
pp. 399-457), and by Gill (Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phil. 1802, 280-281 ; 18G4, 
194-199 ; and 1865, 177). The greater nnrnber of the species was charac- 
terized by the first of these authors 5 but as the materials at hand were 
insufficient for thorough description, consisting usually of single or im- 
mature examples, the descriptions were necessarily incomplete. Dr. W. 
O. Ayres, among the many valuable additions to our ichthyological 
knowledge made by him during his residence on this coast, added two 
valid species to the list of our flounders. Dr. A. Giinther enumerates 
the species described by Girard and Ayres, but collocates some of them 



70 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

iu (lifferent geuera from those in wMch tliey were placed by tbeir original 
describers, and, misled apparently by Girard's insufficient descriptions, 
characterizes two additional species from specimens which really be- 
longed to forms described by that author. Finally, Prof. T. Gill reviews 
the labors of his predecessors, reclassifies the entu'e group, arranging 
them on a more definite system, and mentions in all seventeen species, 
including tlie Pleiironectes quadrituherculaiiis and Fleuronectes cicatricosus 
of Pallas, the Pleiironectes glacialis of Kichardson {= franklinii Giiuther), 
and two supposed new species, both of which, however, are apparently 
synonymous with two of Girard's species ; Faroj)hrys kubbardi with Faro- 
plirys vetulus Gir., and Metoponops cooperi with the Fsetticlitliys sordidiis 
of the same author. It will thus be perceived that considerable confu- 
sion existed among our flat-fishes ; and iu the endeavor to identify the 
various species described \sy these authors among the examples in the 
Mus. Cal. Acad. Sci., and to pick them out among the fresh fishes, as 
they lay, exposed for sale, in the markets of San Francisco, I soon found 
that the descriptions of external characters already published needed 
revision and amplification, and that the task of identification was ren- 
dered difficult by the great variation in the number of the dorsal and 
anal fin-rays, in the width of the intei^ocular space, and in the length of 
the pectorals, in fishes which evidently belonged to the same species. 

A new and abundant species, with constant characters by which it 
could readily be distinguished from the one Avith which it had probably 
been hitherto confounded, was also discovered. It was at that time my 
intention only to take a few additional notes upon the known species, 
and publish them together with a description of the new form ; but, at 
the suggestion of Prof. D. S. Jordan, of Indiana TJniversity, Bloomington, 
Ind., who is at this time preparing an ichthyology of the United States, 
which will include all the Pacific Coast species, I imdertook the task of 
redescribing and more thoroughly characterizing all the known forms 
belonging to the family that occur in the markets of San Francisco. 

Cy repeated visits to the markets, extendmg over a period of six 
months, I have verified the occurrence here of aU the species hitherto 
described^rom this coast, with the exception of the more northern 
FleiironecTcsfranliinn, and the possible exception of the Pallasian spe- 
cies quadrituberculatus and cicatricosus. Two new species of rare occur- 
rence, and belonging to a group not hilherto known to be found in oiu' 
■Raters, have also been added to the fauna ; but as five nominal species 
are eliminated, the total number of valid forms occurring here is only 
thirteen. 

My method of procedure has been to write a full description from 
the specimens in the possession of the California Academy of Sciences, 
and'^then to incorporate with it the results of notes taken from fresh 
individuals, altering and adding so as to include the range of variation. 
The descriptions are not, therefore, from types, but from an examination 
of several specimens, and a comparison of these with several others. To 
the descriptions measnrements of several specimens (except in the case of 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 71 

one rare species) are appended ; those taken from tlie preserved specimens 
and from the fresh individuals in my possession being supplemented by 
others taken from indi\dduals as they lay on the stalls. The measurements 
are followed by remarks upon the variation of individuals, by the enum- 
eration of two or three obvious distinguishing characters, and by such 
notes upon the localities, comparative abundance, &c., of the various 
forms as I have been able to collect. I greatly regret my inability to do 
much at present toward the elucidation of the habits, food, and distribu- 
tion of the several species. The classification adopted is, with one or 
two exceptions, that which will be followed by Professors Jordan and 
Gilbert in their forthcoming work ;* and I take this occasion to thank 
them for the valuable aid they have rendered me by sending me a copy 
of that portion of their manuscript, and on various occasions tendering 
me valuable information. 

To conclude, I have taken every care to guard against error, but I am 
aware that it is i^ossible that some of my conclusions may be open to 
criticism. 

I have avoided burdening my descriptions with full synonymy and 
references, contenting myself with the already given enumeration of the 
works in which earlier descriptions will be found, and with the mention 
of the original name of each species.

All the species that I have examined have seven branchiostegals on

blind and colored sides. As I am not familiar with the Atlautic species, 
I cannot be certain whether these are to be considered as family char- 
acters; they are not mentioned in Gilnther's diagnosis of the Pleuro- 
nectidce.

The fin-formula given above is that of Ayres. The species is of rare 
occurrence on this part of the coast, but is occasionally brought to mar- 
ket. As I have as yet only seen one specimen, or rather a part of one, 
as the greater i)art of the body had been cut away and sold when I saw 
it, I cannot pronounce as to its specific identity with S. vuhjaris. The 
only notes I could make were as follows : Teeth in a double row in both

jaws, with a few irregular teetli between tlie rows, about equally devel- 
oped ou both sides, strong, numerous. BrancUiostegals seven. Inter- 
ocular space wider than the length of the eye. Caudal with about 20 
rays, the principal rays each several times bifurcate, the posterior mar- 
gin nearly straight. Weight between 40 and 50 pounds. I am told 
that this fish will probably be of more common occurrence as the season 
advances. Toward the northern parts of our Pacific seaboard, at Van- 
couver's Island and along the shores of British Columbia, the halibut is 
said to be quite common, and to attain a weight of 70 to 100 pounds, or 
even more. Specimens from Alaska, I am told, have been identified by 
Dr. Bean with the Atlantic H. vulgaris. 

HIPPOGLOSSOIDES Gottsche. 

Mouth large; maxillary broad, flat, extending nearly to the centre of 
the eye ; teeth nearly equal on both sides of the jaws, rather small, coni- 
cal. No teeth on vomer or palatines. Eyes and color on the right side. 
Anterior nostrils on colored side with a short tube, on blind side with a 
raised margin ; lower pharyngeal teeth in a single row. Dorsal com- 
mencing over the upper eye ; ventrals both lateral ; caudal entire, its 
middle rays produced. Scales of moderate size, more or less strongly 
ciliated ; lateral line nearly straight, simple. Branchiostegals seven.

Dorsal and abdominal outlines equally and regularly curved from the 
line of the centre of the eyes to the caudal peduncle ; upper outline of 
snout strongly curved, almost a quadrant, the junction of this curve 
with the dorsal outline forming a concavity over the anterior half of 
the upper eye. Peduncle of tail widening posteriorly, in its narrowest 
part from about f to f of the greatest depth of the body, which is a little 
over ^ to f of the total length ; length of the head from -fV to less than 
4 of the total length ; eye contained about 4i times ; snout (measured 
from a line joining the anterior margins of the orbits to the tip of the 
upper jaw) 5i to 6 times in the length of the head. Posterior nos- 
trils of both sides situated on a line joining the front margins of the 
orbits ; anterior nostrils on both sides with a raised margin, prolonged 
posteriorly into a linguiform flap ; the posterior sub-elliptical, simi)le.

straight border forming an obtuse angle with the abdominal outline, and 
its prominent posterior extremity below the centre of the eye ; a knob 
at the symphysis. Cleft of mouth oblique, the tip of the premaxillaries 
on a horizontal line with the upper margin of the lower eye, and the 
posterior broad end of the maxillaries extending to nearly the centre of

dible, but forming a double row in tbe intermaxillaries. Front teeth 
largest in both jaws. The outer row in the intermaxillaries much larger 
than the inner, which is formed of very small teeth ; but most of the 
outer row smaller than those of the mandible. The teeth on the colored 
side of the upi^er jaw are most numerous and smallest. Upper pharyn- 
geals each with two irregular rows of teeth, the hinder largest, conical, 
sharp, recurved. Lower pharyngeals each with a single row of similar 
teeth. Eyes rather large, lateral, equal in front. Interorbital space 
rather narrow, equal in adults to about one-third of the loDgitudinal 
diameter of the eye. Gill-rakers long and slender, those of the first 
branchial arch about equal in length to the width of the interorbital 
space. Pectoral of the colored side scarcely \ of the total length, or 
slightly more than half the length of the head, inserted level with the 
loAver eye, and consisting of 13 rays, the first two simple, the others oisce 
or twice bifurcate ; the third ray longest, lower rays diminishing reg- 
ularly. Pectoral of the blind side equal in width to that of colored side, 
but only about § as long. Dorsal commencing on the dorsal ridge 
immediately over the anterior margin of the pupil, all the rays simple,

anterior axil of the latter less than half the width of the pectoral base ; 
their tips extending backwards beyond the anus nearly to the anal 
spine; the first two rays simple, the others once or twice bifurcate. 
Lateral line without abrupt arch, curving gently doAvnwards from its 
origin to the median line of the side of the body, which it reaches at a 
vertical from the tip of the pectoral ; thence straight to the end of the 
caudal. Number of scales in lateral line about 96 in a specimen 0| in.

round the lower eye. Scales of colored side longer than wide, rather 
small, distinctly ciliate on their posterior margins, somewhat deciduous; 
uniform over the whole of the body opercles and checks, and continued 
forwards on the interorbital space to the anterior margin of the eye. 
Jaws and snout scaleless ; scales of blind side not ciliated. A row of 
small ciliated scales along each ray of the dorsal and anal on the colored 
side, extending almost or quite to the tips of the rays ; none on the first

Although this species is of quite common occurrence in the markets 
of San Francisco, it appears to have hitherto escaped description, prob- 
ably on account of its extei-nal resemblance to Girard's Psettichthys 
melanostietus, from which it is not distinguished by the dealers, who are 
able to discriminate between most of the other species. With several 
other kinds, it is sold under the name of "Sole." From melanostietus it 
may be known by the more backward origin of the dorsal fin, the first 
rays of which are lower than those next following; by the larger eyes and 
rather narrower interocular space ; the absence of an accessory dorsal 
branch to the lateral line, and the want of conspicuous bhick dots on the 
colored side. The surface is decidedly less rough than that of melano- 
stietus, although the scales are ciliated. The number of scales in the 
lateral line is rather ditlicult to count, but there are about fourteen to 
an inch m an example lif long (caudal included). 

1^0. 1 had 90 dorsal and 71 anal rays; I^o. 2, D. 94, A. 72; and Xo. 4, 
D. 93, A. 75. 

In the stomach of ^o. 2 were three half-digested anchovies [Engraulis 
ringcns) and a shrimp-lilie crustacean {Ilippohjtc). 

No. 2 had about 42 teeth in the mandible, and at least G2 in the inter- 
maxillaries, those on the colored side most numerous and smallest; 
while hi No. 4 the mandible had 14 teeth on the blind, and 11 on the 
colored side, the intermaxillaries about 14 on the blind, and numerous 
(ca. 50) small teeth on the colored side, without counting the inner row 
of still smaller teeth. 

From H. limandoides = dcntattis, of the Atlantic, the present species 
diflers in having more dorsal and anal rays, and in the presence of an 
anal spine. 



76 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

I have taken the liberty to name this species after my friend Prof. D. 
S. Jordan, in acknowledgment of the assistance and advice I have re- 
ceived from him. 

PSETTICHTHYS Girard. 

Mouth large; maxillary broad, flat, extending to the front of the 
pupil ; teeth well develoi^ed on both sides of the jaws, iiTCgular. l^s"© 
teeth on vomer or palatines. Eyes and color on the right side ; ante- 
rior nostril on colored side tubular, that on blind side wdth a flap. 
Lower i)haryngeal teeth in a single row. Dorsal commencing in advance 
of the upper eye; ventrals lateral; caudal entire. An accessory lateral 
line on both sides of the bod}'; lateral line nearly straight. Scales 
ciliated. Brauchiostegals seven. 

The only one of Girard's original characters which remains to distin- 
guish this genus from HippogJossoides is the more anterior commence- 
ment of the dorsal ; as a thorough examination of specimens larger than 
those described by that author (4f in. long) proves that ciliated scales 
are common to both genera. The presence of an accessory lateral line is, 
however, a character which ajipears sufficient to warrant the separation 
of this form as a genus or sub-genus, since it is used as a generic char- 
acter in the Pleuronectinw. 

PSETTICHTHYS iMELANOSTiCTUS Girard. 

D. 78-88. A. 58-62. C. 3-6-6-3. P. 11. Y. 6. 

Body elongated, narrow; dorsal and abdominal outlines regularly 
curved and nearly equal from nape and ventrals to caudal peduncle ; 
curve of snout joining that of nape over the anterior half of the upper 
eye; abdominal outline from posterior end of mandible to ventrals 
nearly straight. Greatest depth contained in the total length from 
about three to a little more than two and a half times ; head four to Ave 
times in the same. Eyes small, contained seven to eight times ; snout 
(measured from orbit of upi)er eye to tip of intermaxillaries) about five 
times in the length of the head ; peduncle of tail from three aud a half 
to four times in the greatest depth. Anterior nostril on colored side with 
a short tube, the opening wide and anterior ; that on blind side with a 
raised margin or short tube, prolonged posteriori}^ ; posterior nostril on 
both sides without flap, its posterior border in advance of the anterior 
border of the orbit. Eyes equal in front, lateral ; interocular space 
smooth, not elevated, of variable width. Mouth large, oblique; lower 
jaw considerably the longer, its tip, in the closed moutji, level with the 
lower margin of the upper eye; a prominent symphysial knob ; mandible 
joining the abdominal outline at an obtuse angle. Posterior extremity 
of the maxillary extending to a vertical drawn from the front of the 
pupil. Teeth rather small, in a single row on both sides of both jaws, 
conical, sharp, recurved, those in front much the largest in both jaws, 
and those in the mandible larger than those in the intermaxillaries (ex-

cept three or four lai'ge caniues iu front of the latter). Teeth on colored 
side of upper jaw very small, numerous. In adults about 33 teeth iu 
the mandible, 43-50 in the intermaxillaries. A single row of six or 
seven sharp, conical, recurved teeth on each upper pharyngeal^ lower 
pharyngeals very slender, each armed with a row of about twelve 
sleucier, sharp, recurved teeth. Gill-rakers of first branchial arch about 
half the length of the eyes, flexible, those of the other arches similar, 
but shorter. Origin of dorsal a little in advance of the anterior margin 
of the upper eye, and immediately above the posterior nostril of the 
blind side ; its anterior rays over the eyes and on the occiput higher 
than those immediately behind them, but not quite equal to the longest 
rays of the central portion of the fin, which are from about the thirtieth 
to the fortieth rays. The first ray is twisted to the left, toward the nos- 
tril. From the central rays the tin declines regularly to its termination 
opposite to that of the anal, and distant from the caudal about half the 
depth of its peduncle. Anal with an acute horizontal spine, its origin 
opposite the centre of the length of the pectoral, and its longest rays 
opposite to those of the dorsal. Peduncle of caudal very sUghtly dilated 
at the base of that fin, the posterior margin of which is convex, and the 
principal rays once or twice bifurcate, the first bifiu'cation at about one- 
third of their length from the base. Pectoral of colored side with eleven 
rays, the rays, except the first two, once bifurcate ; that of the blind 
side nearly equal in size and similarly bifurcate. Ventrals inserted with 
their posterior axil about half the width of the pectoral base in advance 
of the anterior axil of that fin ; their rays once or twice bifurcate, and 
then- extremity Mliug short of the vent. Lateral hue very slightly 
raised above the pectorals, about 107-118 scales between its origin and 
that of the caudal in a specimen eleven inches long. An accessory 
lateral Une along the base of the dorsal, ending about under the 24th 
dorsal ray on the colored side, and under the 17th-20th on the blind 
side. A branch from this accessory line to the main lateral line at back 
of head; a line of pores, indistinct in small specimens, more distinct in 
lai-ger, can be traced fr-om the lateral line across the cheek to the lower 
margin of the upper eye ; and a little behind the end of this a row of 
pores branches downwards around the lower eye, ending opposite the 
posterior margin of the pupil. Scales very small, imbricate, ciliate, ex- 
tending over head and gill-covers; snout and lower jaw scaleless. Free 
end of each scale tinmcate. A single row of small scales along each ray 
of the dorsal and anal on the colored side, except on about the first 
third of the dorsal aud the first two oj three rays of the anal. Caudal 
covered with small ciliated scales on the colored side almost to the tip 
of the rays, and with smooth scales on the colored side. Scales of blind 
side smooth, a few scales on the bases of the central raye of the dorsal 
aud anal on this side. Color of right side ash-gray, interspersed with 
crowded black dots just large enough to be perceptible with the naked 
eye ; numerous black points on the exposed part of each scale. When

As will be seen by the foregoing figures, the width of the interocular 
space, the length of the pectorals, that of the caudal peduncle, and the 
number of rays in the dorsal, are very variable. 

In the stomach of an example 7^ inches in length. were the half- 
digested remains of two anchovies [EngrmiUs rimgens) each about three 
inches long. 

This is the most common of the species sold as "Sole" in the markets 
of this city. Most of the individuals brought to market are from ten to 
twelve inches in length; but many reach sixteen or even eighteen inches. 
The black dots over the upper side, the long anterior dorsal rays, in- 
serted more in advance than is usual, and the small eyes, render this fish 
easy to recognize.

Body elongated, dorsal outline forming a low regular curve from the 
junction of the snout to the caudal peduncle; snout rather long, a slight 
depression over the anterior part of the upper eye, where it joins the 
dorsal outline. Abdominal outUue from the extremity of the mandible 
to the caudal peduncle forming a curve corresponding to that of the 
dorsal outline. Greatest depth a little less than f ; length of head about 
-3^ of the entire length; eye about i-^, snout -5^4 of the length of the 
head; interocular space -^^-^ of the same; width of caudal peduncle 
about i of the greatest depth; gTcatest distance from anal to straight 
portion of lateral line less than the length of the head. Anterior nos- 
trils of both sides with a tongue-like tlap on their posterior border; pos- 
terior nostrils patulous, small, slightly in advance of the orbit. Eyes 
equal in front, small, the upper well below tlie dorsal ridge, yet some- 
what directed upwards. Interocular space smooth, flat, not elevated, a 
scarcely perceptible ridge from origin of lateral hue to upper eye, where 
it divides, forming a raised margin to the posterior portion of that eye; 
a short ridge over the anterior part of the upper margin of the lower 
eye; in large individuals the width of the interocular space exceeds the 
length of the eye. Mouth large; maxillary reaching to a vertical from 
the posterior margin of the lower eye, and to a distance below that eye 
exceeding its longitudinal diameter. Mandible about fV of the length 
of the head, its tip level with the upper margin of the lower eye; its 
straight lower border forming a very obtuse angle with the abdominal 
outline; a shght symphysial prominence. Teeth in both jaws slender, 
acute, slightly recurved, about 15 in the upper and 8 in the lower jaw 
in individuals under 12" long, besides numerous rasp-like teeth in the 
hinder part of the intermaxillary. The front teeth in the mandible are 
longer and more recurved than those farther back. First pair of upper 
pharyngeals a cushion of villiform teeth, with a row of about 12 larger 
recurved ones; second and third harnpygeals united, with three or four 
irregular rows of teeth like the larger of the first pair; lower pharyn-

height in the centre of its length, and thence diminishing very slowly, 
forming a low arch; the distance between its termination and the origin 
of the caudal about equal to the depth of the caudal peduncle ; dorsal 
and anal coterminal. A few of the posterior rays of the dorsal and anal 
are bifiu-cate. Anal without spine, its origin very slightly behind the

outer rays somewhat produced; all the principal rays three or more 
times bifurcate. The longest dorsal rays are about the 30th-38th ; the 
longest anal rays about the 15th-23d. Pectoral of the colored side 
about half the length of the head, and contained in the total length be- 
tween nine and ten times ; its rays once or twice bifurcate, the first two

This is not of very frequent occurrence in our markets, although it 
can scarcely be called rare. It attains a larger size than any other of 
our species except, the true Hippof/lossus, and it is probably this circum- 
stance, together with its elongated form, that has led the fishermen to 
name it the "Bastard Halibut." Large specimens are sold under this 
name, but immature individuals are retailed as "Turbot." The largest 
I have yet seen weighed, respectively, 43 and 5S pounds, and the latter 
measured about 4 feet 10 inches in length when entire. It is very sel- 
dom taken in the bay, and is said to bo of more frequent occurrence 
southwards than northwards, but I cannot at present ascertain its south- 
ern range. From its occurrence at Monterey it is often called the Mon- 
terey halibut. It is said to be a tough, coarse fish. It is taken as far 
north as Tomales Bay. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 (of which the dimensions 
are given) are young* alcoholic specimens in the Museum of the Cal. 
Acad. Sci., and their dorsal and anal fin-rays AA^ere, respectively, D. 76, 
A. 60; D. 70, A. 55; D. 70, A. 55; and D. 71, A. 53. No. 5 had 69 dor- 
sal and 53 anal rays. Some specimens have a feAv jiores on the occi^mt 
behind and above the horizon of the upper eye, running- downwards and 
backwards towards the lateral line. The number of scales in the lateral 
line is very difiicult to count. From all the other Californian species 
with large jaws, it may be known by its elongate form and boldly arched 
lateral line. 

I have for some time suspected that Uropsetta californica (Ayres) Gill, 
and Paralichthys maculosus Girard, were identical, and I think that I can 
now demonstrate their identity beyond reasonable doubt. My suspicion 
arose as follows : The large specimens of the Monterey halibut, weighing* 
40-50 pounds, are considered by all the dealers to be of the same species as 
the small specimens, and, from their general similarity, no doubt as to 
their identity with each other and with Uropsetta californica arose in my 
mind until, on critically couiparing a small individual with Girard's de- 
scrii)tion of P. viaciilosus, I found that it agreed with the latter in every 
particular except in its sinistral eyes and color. Now arose two ques- 
tions : 1st. Were the large individuals really specifically identical with 
the small ones f 2d. Was there a dextral form, and, if so, was the dex- 
tral form a distinct species f 

I have not yet had the opportunity to take full measurements of a full- 
grown individual, as all the large ones I have seen were cut up before I 
examined them, but I have the following- reasons to give for includiug- 
all under one species : 

1st. The form of the caudal fin and the outline of the posterior ]}art of 
the body are alike in large and small sinistral individuals ; the former 
having the sinuous posterior margin, with the central and external rays 
l)roduced, described by Girard as characteristic of P. macuJosus. 

2d. The smaller sinistral individuals agree with Ayres's description 
of Hlppoglossus ( Uropsetta) cali/ornicus, except in the form of the tail, 
which is shown as slightly concave in Ajtcs's figure (Proc. Cal. Acad. 
Proc. Nat. Mus. 79 6 July 9,18 79. 



82 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

ii, 18G0, fig. 10). The figure is but a sketcli, and is inaccurate in many 
respects. 

3d. The larger individuals are always sold as "halibut," attain the 
dimensions of the true halibut, and are evidently identical with Ayres's 
species. 

4th. The small sinistral individuals have all the characters of Para- 
liclitliyfi maculosKs Gir., excei)t the position of the eyes and color, and 
some difference in the color of the spots. 

These reasons, although they point strongly towards identity, do not 
prove it ; but I have lately i)rocured an individual (No. 5) which has the 
characteristics of Ayres's species, yet is dextral, thus agreeing exactly 
with that of Girard ; so that I can now add to my reasons — 

5th. A sjiecimen of dimensions intermediate between that of Girard 
(7' long) and the large individuals before mentioned has the characters 
of U. californica, but is dextral, as stated by Girard in his description of 
P. maculosm. In this specimen, the interorbital area is proportionally 
much wider than in the smaller examples, exceeding the longitudinal 
diameter of the eye ; and the row of spots along the dorsal and abdomi- 
nal outlines, so evident in the small individuals, is almost obsolete, 
traces of one or two of the posterior ones being all that is left of them. 
The principal caudal rays are many times dichotomized, the base of the 
fin is fleshy, and its scaly covering is very conspicuous ; some of the 
rays of the right pectoral are twice bifurcate ; about eight of the poste- 
rior rays of the dorsal and anal are bifurcate ; each ray of the dorsal and 
anal (except the most anterior and posterior) is seen to have, upon its 
anterior face, a roAV of i^rincipal scales, and numerous accessory scales, 
all resembling those of the body, but smaller ; each scale of the body is 
seen to be followed by several supernumerary scales arranged around 
its posterior margin ; and the pectoral of the colored side has only ten 
rays; that of the blind side eleven. As this is the only dextral exam- 
j)le out of about ten individuals that have come under my observation, 
I am inclined to believe that dextral specimens are comparatively rare, 
at least on this part of the coast. As the generic name Faralichthys 
has precedence over that of Uropseita, it must be retained for the spe- 
cies, which must henceforth be known as FaraUchthj maculosus.

Metoponops Gill is evidently identical with Citharlchthys. All the 
cliaracters usually considered generic agree; and the specific cliaracters 
given (Proc. Acad. jSTat. Sci. Phil. 1804:, 198) are those which properly 
belong to CitharichtJn/s sordidus Girard. Girard's description, taken 
froiJi an immature individual 5^ in. long, is in many respects defective; 
that of Gill approaches much nearer to completeness, but, as it was 
taken from a single sun-dried specimen, it shows characters which arise 
from the drying.

Outline of body sub-ellipsoid, but the dorsal and abdominal outlines 
not correspondent, the highest point of the former situated over the tip 
of the pectoral, while the lowest point of the latter is below the base of 
the same fin. Snout almost continuous with the dorsal outline, which 
rises rapidly to the highest point in a bold curve, and thence falls with 
a gently sigmoid curvature to the caudal peduncle. Abdominal outline 
almost straight to the ventrals, thence with a slight sigmoid curve around 
the lowest point to the caudal peduncle. Thus the hinder part of the body 
tapers gradually in a line which becomes slightly concave, both above and 
below, as it approaches the caudal peduncle. Greatest depth of body 
contained 2^ times; length of the head 4|^- times in the greatest length ; 
longitudinal diameter of eye about -|, snout (measured from the lower 
eye) about ^ of the length of the side of the head. Distance from origin 
of anal to lateral line slightly in excess of the length of the head ; 
peduncle of tail short, about i of the greatest width, slightly widening 
toward caudal. Eyes elliptical, large, the upper turned somewhat upward, 
the lower lateral, and about i of its longitudinal diameter in advance of 
the upper ; interocular spac3 equal to about half the transverse diameter 
of the eye, and made to appear narrower by an elevated ridge, which, 
commencing on the cheeks, passes along the posterior lower margin of 
the upper eye, descends obliquely to the upper margin of the lower 
orbit, and continues to the intermaxillary. A less prominent ridge along 
the lower margin of the upper eye, merging in the principal ridge where it 
commences to descend. Thus the anterior and larger portion of the in- 
terocular area is concave, l^ostrils of colored side in a hue with the 
upper margin of the lower eye ; anterior nostrils of both sides with a 
long narrow liap in front ; posterior simple. The anterior nostril of the 
colored side has also a raised margin, prolonged somewhat posteriorly. 
Mouth large, oblique ; extremity of the mandible slightly projecting, and 
on a level with the upper margin of the pupil of the lower eye when the 
mouth is closed. The lower border of the mandible almost in a straight 
line with the anterior part of the abdominal outline. Posterior extremity 
of the maxillary extending to a vertical drawn midway between the

centre and the front of the pupil of the lower eye. Teeth slender, acute, 
incurved, closely set at regular distances from each other, gradually in- 
creasing in size forwards ; about equal in size on both sides of both jaws, 
and extending the full length of the gape on both sides. Upper phar^^l- 
geals each with a single row^ of G-8 slender, rather long, sharp, recurved 
teeth; lower pharyngeals each with a single functional row of sinnlar 
teeth, all but some of the most anterior buried in the gum almost to their 
points; lower pharyngeal bones separate, Gill-rakers of 1st pair of 
branchial arches about equal in length to the width of the interocular 
space, rather stiff; those of the other arches gradually diminishing to the 
fourth ; spinulose on their upper edge. Dorsal arising a little before the 
anterior rim of the upper orbit, close behind the posterior nostril of the 
blind side; gradually increasing in height to about the 38th-48th rays, 
which are behind the highest point of the dorsal outline, and thence 
rapidly decreasing ; the last rays small and closely set. Anal arising ver- 
tical with the posterior axil of the base of the pectorals ; its longest rays 
(23d-27th) somewhat deeper than those of the dorsal are high. From 
these rays the depth of the fin diminishes rapidly to its termination 
opposite that of the dorsal ; the posterior rays, like those of that fin, very 
small and closely set. No anal spine visible externally. Posterior mar- 
gin of caudal almost straight when closed, but slightly wedge-shaped ; 
the centre rays longest, when opened out; principal rays bifurcate three 
times. Pectoral of left or colored side about ^ of the total length, and 
consisting of thirteen rays, all, except the first three, once bifurcate ; 
fourth ray longest. Pectoral of right side §-t of the length of that of 
the colored side ; rays simple. Ventrals short, but broad at base and 
broadly rounded when opened, their tips extending beyond the third 
anal ray, and the posterior margin of their base situated a little anterior 
to the anterior axil of the pectoral. Ventral of the colored side on the 
abdominal ridge ; rays simple. Lateral line almost straight, yet rising 
somewhat anteriorly ; very distinct ; tubes simple. Number of scales 
between base of caudal and head 05-70. No hnes of pores on head. 
Scales rather large, very thin and flexible, deciduous, almost mem- 
branous, smooth ; the free end truncate, each pocket of the dermis bor- 
dered by a delicate membrane of darker color than the scale, and often 
broken up into tags ; engaged portion of scale with slight radiating 
stria). Those of tlie anterior portion are as deep as long, or even 
deeper ; those of the posterior part of the body and of the caudal peduncle 
are more or less elongated. The scales vary much in size and shape ; 
the largest are on the abdominal region behind and below the pectoral; 
the smallest around the eyes and on the interorbital space, snout, and 
lower jaw; the two latter only partially covered with scales. Dorsal 
and anal with a row of small scales along each ray on the colored side. 
Caudal scaly at the base, and with the membrane between tlie rays 
covered Avith scales on both sides. Scales of blind side similar to those 
of colored. Color dull reddish yellow ; the outline of e.ach scale ren-

Three other specimens, the fin-rays of which were counted, had respect- 
ively D. 95, A. 72 ; D. 93, A. 70, and D. 98. 

Girard gives the number of dorsal rays as 82, while none of the 
specimens which I have examined have less than 92. As the range in 
number of dorsal and anal fin-rays is considerable in the individuals I 
have examined, it is quite possible that some may have as few as 82 
dorsal rays ; but the close agreement in the number of anal rays found 
by Girard and by myself leads me to supi)Ose that the number 82 is a 
typographical error. 

This is a tolerably common species in our markets, but is usually 
taken outside of the bay. I have not yet seen any exceeding 12-14 
inches in length. 

From Xo. 5 was taken a specimen of Engraulis ringens, which it had 
only partially swallowed when caught ; the tail hanging out of the mouth. 

The Engraulis thus appears to be a favorite article of food with at 
least three of our large-mouthed fiat-fishes. This species may be readily 
recognized by its sinistral coloration and eyes, its smooth scales, dirty 
yellow color, and the gradual tapering of the body into the caudal peduncle, 
with a concave curve on both dorsal and abdominal outlines. Unlike 
Flatichthys steUatits and Paralichthys maculosus, this species appears to 
be invariably sinistral. 

GLYPTOCEPHALUS Gottsche. 
Form extremely elongated ; mouth small, the short, narrow maxillary 
scarcely reaching the front margin of the eye; teeth most developed on 
the blind side, incisor-like, broad, equal, forming a continuous cutting

with an obliquely transverse row of about nine bluntly conical teeth; 
lower pharyngeals with a single row of similar teeth. Brauchiostegals

nearly straight. Dorsal fiu very long, of more than ninety rays ; scales 
smooth. Anal with or without a spine; caudal convex on posterior 
margin. 

The following two species are separated by well-marked characters from 
each other; but I have not considered it necessary to use a different 
generic name for G. zacMrus^ in which the anal is preceded by a spine, 
and the teeth are continued farther on the blind side.

Form elongate ellii^soid, dorsal and abdominal outlines curving regu- 
larly and similarly from head to caudal peduncle, which slightly in- 
creases in Avidtli posteriorly. Snout continuous with dorsal outline, but 
ylightly more curved ; lower margin of head straight. Greatest width 
contained about 3f , head more than 5 times in the total length, or the 
former about 2t^ and the latter about 4^ times in the length without the

the length of the head. Anterior nostril on both sides tubular, the tube 
short, its posterior margin produced into a flaj) ; posterior without flap. 
Nostrils small; hinder margin of posterior nostril about vertical with the 
anterior margin of the ui^i^er orbit. Lower eye somewhat in advance of 
the upper, which reaches the dorsal profile at its anterior extremity. lu- 
terorbital space a very narrow, smooth, somewhat elevated ridge of bone. 
Cleft of mouth nearly equal on both sides, very small, oblique ; the max- 
illary reaching but little beyond a vertical from the anterior margin of 
the lower eye, and scarce so far as a vertical from that of the upper. 
Tip of mandible level with the centre of the lower eye, and scarcely pro- 
jecting in the closed mouth. Lips tolerably w^ell developed. Teeth 
broad, thin, incisor-like, forming a continuous sharp cutting edge along 
the blind side of both jaws, but in both ending rather abruptly before 
reaching the colored side. Twelve teeth in the lower and nine or ten in 
the upper jaw; those at the anterior commencement of the row slightly 
smaller than the others. Upper pharyngeal bones with 5-9 sharp coni- 
cal teeth on each, the anterior with the greatest number; lower pharyn- 
geal teeth in two rows, sharp, conical, those of the inner row larger than 
those of the outer, except in front, where there are a few larger teeth; 
equal in size in both rows. Gill-rakers short, slender, flexible, lanceo- 
late. Dorsal and anal long and low, similar, coterminous, fleshy at base ; 
the rays simple, their tips free. Dorsal commencing opposite the centre 
of the pupil of the upper eye, the longest rays a little behind the centre 
of the length of the fin, and about ^ of the width of the body in length. 
5^0 spine before anal, the first ray of which is only a little i)osterior to 
the hinder pectoral axil, and its longest rays opposite and equal to those 
of the dorsal. Distance from the end of the dorsal and anal fins to the

Pectorals small ; that of colored side contained about 8^ times in the 
total length; rays twelve in number, once bifurcate. Pectoral of blind 
side scarcely three-fourths as long as that of the colored side ; rays nine 
or ten, some of them bifurcate. Veutrals very small, inserted about the 
width of the pectoral base in advance of the anterior axil of that fin ; 
their length contained more than live times in that of the head. Late- 
ral line straight, passing along the median line of the side of the body 
and of the caudal, about 140 scales from its origin to tlie base of that 
lin. Scales very small, smooth, becoming smaller along the dorsal and 
abdominal margins; smaller scales continuing for some distance upwards 
and downwards on the bases of both the dorsal and anal, upon both blind 
and colored sides, especially upon the latter, where scales cover the 
whole surtace between a.s well as upon the rays. The bases of the pec- 
torals and caudal are also covered with scales on both sides. On the 
fore part of the anal, the scales reacli to the tips of the rays. The scales 
upon the fins are much smaller than those upon the body. Scales on 
blind side smooth; snout scaleless. Color nearly uniform dark blackish 
gray ; the scales covered on their exposed portion witli black points, 
which cannot be distinguished by the naked eye. Blind side opaque 
white, with numerous small black dots evenly distributed. Fins on col- 
ored side with the membrane light slate-color, sprinkled with small black 
dots; the rays and scales of the same color as the body. Distal margins 
of all the fins considerably darker. The black dots extend to the inte- 
rior of the mouth, covering tliehyoid surfaces, and the pharyngeal teeth 
are tipped with reddish orange.

The scales upon the body and fins are highly deciduous, and the lat- 
eral line is much less distinctly pronounced than in the succeeding spe- 
cies. Although the lowest pair of branchiostegals is not easy to make 
out, I have no doubt that seven is the correct number. The individual 
10^^ in length, iS'o. 3, is the largest I have yet seen, and is probably 
adult. In flavor this fish is inferior to G. zachirns. This species was cer- 
tainly not brought to market during the winter months. I first saw it 
March 15, and fiom that date to the end of April a few have usually 
been exposed for sale, but it cannot be said to be abundant. It is not 
taken within the bay. 

The dark color, elongated form, and correspondingly long dorsal and 
anal fins render this species easy to distinguish from every other except 
G. sachirus, from Avhich it can be known by its short pectoral, entire 
want of teeth on colored side, and more pointed form of the front part 
of the head, as well as by the absence of an anal spine. G. ijacifieus 
differs from G. cynoglossus of the Atlantic in the greater relative length 
of the head, the smaller number of teeth in the upper jaw, and the 
smaller number of dorsal and anal rays.

Body elongate-ovate, the anterior portion of the oval shorter than the 
posterior ; snout declivous, almost vertical, its tip level with the upper 
margin of the lower eye, and its curve uniting without sensible depres- 
sion with that of the nape ; dorsal outline rising with a regular gentle 
curve from the snout to about the twenty-second dorsal ray, thence de- 
clining very gradually and regularly with but slight cur\'ature to the 
caudal peduncle. The abdominal outline is almost straight from the 
knob of the mandible to the ventral ; from thence to the end of the anal 
curved in the isame manner as the dorsal outline. Peduncle of tail 
slightly exj)anded towards the caudal, its least width about one-fourth 
of the greatest depth of the body. The greatest width of the body is 
contained from 3J to 3i times, and the length of the head from about 5J^ 
to 5i- times in the total length; the eye about 3 J times, and the snout 
about 8 times in the length of the head. The greatest distance from 
the anal to the lateral line is less than the length of the head. Eyes 
large, elliptical, lateral, the lower in advance of the upper about half 
the length of the pupil, and scarcely reaching the dorsal profile ante- 
riorly. Interocular space very narrow, about ^ of the longitudinal 
diameter of the eye, smooth, not raised above the eye in a fresh fish. 
A slight ridge rises at its posterior part, forms the lower posterior 
margin of the upper eye, and dies out on the cheek. Kostrils of riglit 
side level with the upper margin of the lower eye; the anterior with 
a short tube, the posterior with a raised margin, and vertical with 
the front margin of the lower orbit. Posterior nostril of blind side 
in advance of the eye; anterior nostril nearly as on colored side. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEQM. 89 

The nostrils are small and inconspicuous. Gape of mouth very small 
on colored side, considerably larger on the Mind side. On the colored 
side the cleft is nearer vertical than horizontal ; the posterior end of the 
maxillary reaches very little behind the anterior margin of the orbit of 
the lower eye, and the symphysis of the intermaxillaries is about level 
with the upper edge of the orbit. Mandible projecting in the closed 
mouth, short, not passing a vertical from the front margin of the pupil, 
with a prominent knob below the symphysis, and a smaller one at its 
posterior extremity. Teeth on both sides of the jaws throughout the 
full length of the gape, in a single row, broad, but thick, forming a blunt 
continuous edge, about thirty-four in the lower jaw and rather fewer in 
the upper in an individual ll^^r' long. In an example 14|' long there 
were 14 teeth on the colored and 20 on the bUnd side of the mandible, 
the latter the larger ; in the intermaxillaries, 13 on the colored and 23 
on the blind side. Each lower pharyngeal with a double row of teeth, 
the inner larger than the outer ; the four anterior teeth of the outer row 
conspicuously larger than those following. About 12 teeth in each inner 
row. Upper pharyngeals each with a close-set row of G-7 blunt conical 
teeth. Branchiostegals seven; gill-rakers few, flexible, very short. 
Dorsal commencing between Ihe front of the orbit and the pupil, con- 
siderably behind the nostrils, long and low, forming a continuous arch 
of slightly greater curvature than the dorsal outline, the longest rays in 
the central portion, and ending opposite to the anal at about two-thirds 
of the width of the caudal peduncle from the origin of the caudal. Anal 
with a horizontal spine, the first ray rather distant from the visible por- 
tion of the spine, and nearly the length of the ventral behind the pec- 
toral base ; similar to the dorsal. Almost all the rays of dorsal and anal 
directed backwards. Caudal convex on posterior margin, rather narrow, 
the rays once bifurcate, sometimes bifurcate again near the tips. Pectoral 
of colored side exceedingly long and lanceolate, about one-fourth of the 
total length of the fish ; the first five rays simple, the others once bifur- 
cate. Fourth ray longest, fifth nearly equal, sixth a little longer than 
the third, thence diminishing rapidly. Usual proportion of the first four 
rays 3-S-10-12. Pectoral of blind side lanceolate, rather more than one- 
third of the length of that of the colored side, and formed of the same num- 
ber of rays, the first four simple, the others once forked ; fourth and fifth 
rays longest. Ventrals inserted so that their hinder axil is vertical Avith, 
or a little posterior to, the anterior axil of the pectoral ; their tips reaching 
to the first anal ray ; the four posterior rays once bifurcate. Lateral line 
almost straight, rising very shghtly anteriorly, formed of a double row 
of tubes, about 138 in number, excluding those upon the caudal. A 
row of similar pores commencing at the ridge under the upper eye, and 
continuing around the lower eye almost to its front margin. Scales 
small, smooth, uniform over the body, and extending over the head to 
the snout, on which they are smaller. Intermaxillaries and mandibles 
scaleless. Scales of blind side similar. Caudal scaly on both sides ;

Two other specimens had respectively B. 94, A. 80, and D. 94, A. 82. 
The length of the pectoral, as might be expected in so long and narrow 
a fin, varies somewhat ; and the proportional length of the first five 
rays is not constant. No. 4 was measured while perfectly fresh ; the 
others after a few days' immersion in alcohol. In the fresh fish, the in- 
terocular space is not raised above the eyes, and the upper boundary of 
the orbit is hard to define ; but, in alcoholic specimens, the interocular 
space stands out as a narrow ridge of bone. Like the preceding species, 
G. zacMrus is of rare occurrence in the markets, and is not taken in the 
Bay of San Francisco. 

During the six months previous to March none were taken ; but the 
dealers assure me that it usually makes its appearance, in limited quan- 
tities, ill the spring months. Most of the dealers, however, do not dis- 
tinguish between this fish and the preceding one, and sell both as " Sole." 

One dealer, who evidently knew the fish, describing it by its long pec- 
toral, assured me that its flavor was superior to that of any other of our 
species ; I mention this because I had myself previously come to the 
same conclusion. Its flesh is very firm and white, and its flavor ap- 
proaches that of the true sole. No. 4 is the largest I have seen, and 
from the answers I obtain to enquiries, I believe it is beyond the average 
size. The long pectoral, bluff snout, and presence of teeth on the colored 
side of the mouth at once distinguish this species from the preceding, 
as well as from every other species. The nostrils in this and the pre-

produced posteriorly into a Hap ; but the flap is shorter in this species 
than hi the other. 

PLATICHTHYS Girard. 

Form broad; mouth small; maxillary short, not reaching to the pupil 
of the lo\Yer eye ; teeth blunt, in a single row, most developed on the 
blind side of both jaws. Eyes sometimes on the right, sometimes on 
the left side. Anterior nostril of colored side tubular; that of blind side 
Avith a posterior flap. Dorsal not in advance of the eye; anal with a 
horizontal spine ; caudal with the central rays most produced poste- 
riorly. Lateral line slightly arched anteriorly; no accessory dorsal 
In-anch. Scales developed as scattered stellate tubercles, forming a reg- 
ular series along the dorsal and abdominal outlines, and on each side of 
the lateral line. Branchiostegals seven; gill-rakers short; i^haryugeal 
teeth tubercular.

Form broad and short ; outline, including dorsal and anal, broadly 
rhombic ; dorsal and abdominal outlines of the body boldly and regu- 
larly curved ; snout less declivous than the dorsal outline, which it joins 
over the centre of the eye ; caudal i)eduncle long, the sides straight for 
some distance behind the end of the dorsal and anal fins. Greatest 
height of the body contained 2^2 J times, head rather more than 4 times 
in the greatest length ; eye about C times, snout (measured horizontally 
from the lower eye) about. G times in the length of the head ; caudal 
peduncle about o times in the greatest depth of the body. Nostrils of 
colored side in a depression in a line with the centre of the interocular 
space, the anterior tubular ; anterior nostril of blind side with a poste- 
rior flap and a raised margin, posterior without flap. Eyes equal in 
front, or nearly so, the lower sometimes very slightlj^ in advance, the 
upper eye looking obliquely upwards. Interocular space less than half 
the longitudinal diameter of the eye ; a low prominence running upwards 
aud backwards from the anterior upper margin of the lower eye to the 
posterior lower border of the upper eye, and thence backwards to the 
origin of the lateral line ; above the operculum this rises into a prominent 
tubercle. Mouth small; mandible projecting somewhat in the closed 
mouth, its tip level with the upper margin of the lower eye, and its 
lower margin forming a very slight angle with that of the head; pos- 
terior end of the maxillary reaching a vertical slightly in advance of the 
lower eye. Teeth short, broad, forming an irregular cutthig edge, in a 
single row in both jaws, most developed on the blind side, but extending 
more than half-way along the colored side. Upper pharyngeal bones 
each with an irregular series of tubercular teeth, sometimes more or

less broken into smaller rows ; lower pliarj-ngeal bones broad, covered 
with tubercular teeth, Gill-rakers short, broadly conical at base, about 
as long as the interocular is wide, flexible, widely separated. Dorsal com- 
mencing above the middle of the eye, highest in the centre, about the 
olst-32d ray, thence diminishing regularly and in nearly a straight line 
to its termination at a distance from the caudal equal to the depth of the 
caudal peduncle. The longest rays are about f of the length of the 
head, and placed a little behind the broadest part of the body. Anal 
with a more or less conspicuous spine, similar in shape to the dorsal, and 
cotermhious with it. Sixteenth ray longest, the rays behind this dimin- 
ishing in nearly a straight line to the end of the fin ; the longest anal 
rays shorter than those of the dorsal. Caudal rather large, its rays once 
bifurcate ; posterior margin with the central rays more or less produced. 
Pectoral of colored side contained about twice in the length of the head; 
the rays from the thnd to the ninth once bifurcate. Pectoral of blind 
side rather shorter than that of colored; its first five rays simple. Ven- 
trals of six simple rays, a vertical from the posterior margin of their base 
touching the anterior axil of the pectoral base, their tips reaching the 
anal spine, but fidling short of the first ray of that fin. Scales of body 
formed of scattered, stellate, tuberculate bodies, irregidarly disposed on 
both blind and colored sides, but smaller upon the former, and closer to- 
gether on the cheeks and interocular space than on the body. A few 
on the snout ; front part of snout and greater part of lower jaw scaleless. 
A regular row of rather larger scales accompanies the lateral line on both 
sides, above and below. Scales on caudal peduncle elongate, subimbri- 
cate, rough on their posterior edges only. A bare space on the opercu- 
lum, and another on the cheek, of the blind side. A regular row of 
large, stellate, irregularly shaped, rough scales between the bases of the 
dorsal and anal fin-rays, one between each pair of rays ; these scales larger 
than those of the rest of the body. Xo scales on dorsal or anal ; caudal 
rough, with very small scales on the base and outer rays of the colored 
side, and to a less extent on those of the blind side. Lateral liue with 
a slight curve above the pectoral ; the rise much less than the width of 
the base of that fin ; the anterior extremity nearly horizontal. A row 
of pores from a little above the lower margin of the upper eye around 
the lower to front of pupil. No scales on lateral hue; pores tubu- 
lar ; about 83 between base of caudal and head in an individual Of 
in length. Color olivaceous, with areas of citrine when fresh ; the blind 
side white. Dorsal and anal fins with four, caudal with three, black 
bands running in the direction of the rays, the lighter portions of these 
fins reddish brown or olivaceous. Individuals colored on both sides, ex- 
cept on a small portion of the blind side, and others havuig nearly the 
whole of the eyed side white are occasionally brought to market.

The forranlffi of the fin-rays of dorsal and anal in these specimens were 
as follows : No. 1, D. Gl, A. 42 ; No. 2, D. GO, A. 43 ; No. 3, D. 50, A. 42; 
No. 4, D. 58, A. 43 ; No. 5, D. 50, A. 44. Nos. 1 and 2 are alcoholic spe- 
cimens, and have both eyes and color npon the right side. 

This is the most abnndant of all the flat-fishes bronght to onr markets, 
and attains a larger size than any other except the Bastard Halibut 
{ParaUchthys maculosm) and the Hippoglossus. Those taken in San Fran- 
cisco Bay attain a weight of eight, ten, or even twelve pounds, while 
still larger individuals are brought from Humboldt Bay. Those brought 
from the latter locality are, however, very coarse and comparatively poor 
in flesh, so that they do not fetch by far so high a price as those taken 
near San Francisco. It is sold under the name of " Flounder," which 
here appears to be limited strictly to this species. Its broad rhombic 
form, elevated dorsal, deep anal, long caudal peduncle, stellate scales, 
and the bands of color which adorn the vertical fins, give this fish an 
unmistakable /ac/es. The eyes and color are sometimes upon the right 
and sometimes npon the left side. Out of sixty-five individuals, which 
I counted as they lay upon the stall, thirty-two were colored upon the 
right and thirty-three upon the left side. On another occasion I counted 
seventy -five sinistral and fifty-eight dextral individuals, and on a third 
thirty-eight dextral and forty-eight sinistral. Is it not possible that the 
difference of color may be a sexual one ? This is the idea of the more 
intelMgent dealers, but it has not been verified by dissection. Individuals 
occasionally occur with both sides olivaceous, some white blotches alone 
marking the usually uncolored side ; on tiie other hand, I have seen one 
example which had both sides white, except along the dorsal and abdom- 
inal outlines and head of the eyed side.

Form broadly oval ; the dorsal outline regularly curved from the snout 
to the peduncle of the tail. Curve of snout meeting that of dorsal out- 
line over the centre of the eye, forming a slight concavity. Abdominal 
outline running downwards and backwards in a straight line to the origin 
of the anal, thence to the caudal peduncle curved like the dorsal. Form, 
including dorsal and anal fins, broadly rhombic. Height of body 
nearly to quite half of the total length from the tip of the snout to that 
of the caudal ; length of head nearly to rather more than ^ of the same ; 
caudal peduncle ^-| of greatest depth. Snout short, about § of the 
diameter of the orbit. Nostrils on a line with the upper margin of the 
lower eye ; anterior nostril on both eyed and blind side with a fla]) behind ; 
posterior patulous. Eyes about i of the length of the head, the lower 
slightly in advance of the upper, which is slightly directed upwards. 
Interocular space narrow, smooth, elevated, about -J- of the longitudinal 
diameter of the eye. Mouth small, very oblique, lower jaw scarcely pro- 
jecting, the tip of the mandible about level with the top of the pupil of 
the lower eye ; maxillary reaching a little beyond the front margin of 
the lower orl)it. Lips rather thick. A broad band of villiform teeth in 
front in both jaws ; continued also along the blind side in tlie inter- 
maxillary and the mandible, but along the colored side in the mandible 
only. Pharyngeal teeth cardiform, in two or three irregular rows on 
each upper pharyngeal bone, and in a double row on each of the lower. 
Gill-rakers very short, blunt, flexible, distant. No free margin to pre- 
operculum, the skin covering and uniting that bone to the other oper- 
cular bones. Dorsal commencing a little in front of the centre of the 
eye, highest about the 37th ray, which is about half the length of the 
head. Dorsal and anal forming an obtuse rounded angle, giving the fish 
a rhombic form. Anal usually with a spine, its longest rays opposite 
and equal in length to those of dorsal ; its origin very slightly behind a 
vertical from the posterior axil of the pectoral. Anal and dorsal coter-

fin. Caudal slightly and regularly convex ou its posterior margin, its 
rays thrice bifurcate. Pectoral of colored side narrow ; the rays, ex- 
cept the first two, bifurcate ; its length equal to the distance of the lower 
eye from the tip of the operculum, or about -^ of the total length ; the 
fifth ray longest. Pectoral of blind side about ^ of the length of that 
of colored side, its rays once bifurcate, the first four excepted. Ventrals 
about lialf the length of the pectoral of the colored side ; their posterior 
axil vertical with the anterior angle of the pectorals, and their four pos- 
terior rays bifurcate. Lateral line very gently curved above the pec- 
toral, and contained 83 pores in specimens 10 inches long. Accessory 
lateral line variable in length, ending from the 30th to the 59th dorsal 
ray in different individuals, usually about equally developed on the 
blind side. Scales rather small, cycloid, subcircular; those of the ante- 
rior portion of the body not indnicated, but entirely surrounded by skin; 
those of the posterior part imbricated. Scales of the abdominal region 
smaller than those on the rest of the body ; those upon the head narrow, 
much elongate, separate. Scales of the blind side similar in character

Tbo iuterocular space in this species is narrow, perfectly smootli, and 
without ridge or concavity. No. 7 is an anomalous individual, colored 
similarly on both sides, except upon the cheeks and opercular apparatus 
of the blind side, which were yellow when fresh, but have faded to white 
in alcohol. In tliis fish, the upper eye is less lateral than usual, and, as 
if to give it more scope of upward vision, the dorsal outline and fin do 
not curve downwards to meet the curve of the snout, but end in a point 
about I" above the eye ; the outline from the back of the eye to the 
point taking the form of a hollow or " scotia." 

Girard first described this form in Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phil. 185G, p. 
137, and afterwards in the U. S. Pac. E. E. Eep. x, 152. His specimens 
came from Tomales Bay, an inland harbor similar to that of San Fran- 
cisco, but smaller, and situated within the range of the fishing- vessels 
which supply the markets of San Francisco. Dr. Giinther, writing in 
18G2, i>laces f/uttulatus in the genus Plcuronectes, and quotes Girard's 
doscrii)tion, at the same time describing, under the name of Parophnjs 
ayresii,n, form that is evidently the one common in this market. In a 
note he states that "it appears to us specifically distinct from P. camosa,''^ 
but makes no comparison between it and P. r/uttulatus. 

A careful comparison of Girard's description of (juttnUius with Giin- 
ther's of mjrcsii reveals no differences except in the proportions, which 
are variable in most of our fiat-fishes, and in the color, which is described 
by the latter as "uniform brownish lead-colored," by the former as 
" greyish or lead, sprinkled all over with black dots and whitish spots." 
In the only form which I have seen, the whitish spots are of frequent 
occurrence. The greatest discrepancy between the two descriptions is 
in the size of the eyes, which Girard states are " contained three times 
in the length of the side of the head," but which Giinther gives as one- 
fifth of the length of the head. All the specimens I have seen agree in 
this respect, as also in other proportions, more closely with Giinther's 
ayres'u. 

Gill (P. A. N. S. Phil. 1864, p. 190) queries the distinctness of P. ayres^'i, 
and his query tends to confirm tho impression of the identity of the 
two species that I had formed before perusing his paper. 

Most of the smaller specimens that I have examined have the number 
of rays of the dorsal and anal fins as given by Gunther for P. mjresii 
(D. GG, A. 17), which differs from that given by Girard for guttulatns 
only in the absence of one dorsal ray; but larger examples have a much 
larger number of rays : No. 2 (12^" long) had 72 dorsal, 51 anal, and 13 
pectoral rays ; another specimen, 12^" long, had D. 70, A. 48 ; and No. 
5 had D. 71, A. 49. This species is very abundant, and is occasionally 
taken inside, but usually outside, the bay ; it is called by the dealers 
" Turbot," and attains occasionally a length of 18", and a weight of 
about 5 pounds. It can be readily recognized by its broad form, convex 
caudal, the dark dull color of the eyed side, and the yellow margin 
round the head on the blind side. I am informed that the greater portion 
of the turbots brought here are taken in the vicinity of Tomales Bay.

Body broad, comparatively thick ; nape almost continuous witb snout, 
and much less curved than the part of the dorsal outline immediately 
behind it. At the seventeenth dorsal ray the dorsal outline commences 
to rise rapidly, forming a bold and regiilar sweep from thence to the end 
of the dorsal. Abdominal outline nearly a straight line to the ventrals, 
thence curved like the dorsal. Greatest depth of body |^, length of 
head about f , of the total length ; longitudinal diameter of orbit nearly 
^ of the length of the head ; width from tip to tip of expanded dorsal 
and anal fins nearly f of the total length. Caudal peduncle usually 
about i as wide as the greatest depth of the body, widening- considera- 
bly toward the caudal base. Snout extremely short and bluff, its length 
less than } of the diameter of the orbit, and its profile cut oft' from that 
of the nape by the jirojection of the upper orbital margin. Nostrils of 
right side in a depression on the horizon of the upi)er margin of the lower 
eye, those of the blind side on the dorsal ridge slightly behind the front 
margin of the orbit; both anteiior nostrils with atlap; posterior patulous. 
Eyes elliptical, very large, even in front, the upper directed obliquely 
upwards, the upper bony ridge of its orbit raised above the dorsal ridge. 
Interocular space a very narrow bony ridge, its extremities raised into 
l)rominences, and scarcely -^" wide in a specimen 9^" long-. This ridge 
continues forward round the anterior margin of the upper eye to its raised 
upper margin; on the posterior margin of the up])er eye there are also 
two almost spinous prominences. Mouth small, extremely oblique, 
nearer vertical than horizontal ; the end of the maxillary, in consequence 
of this obliquity, scarcely reaching- the front margin of the orbit; man- 
dible not projecting in the closed mouth. Lips thick, fleshy, and plicate. 
Teeth very small, acute, in a broad band in the mandible on the blind 
side and for about two-thuxls of the length of the colored side. On the 
intermaxillaries a much narrower band on the blind side, scarcely reach- 
ing to the s^^nphysis; none on the colored side of these bones. Teeth 
of the blind side of the mandible very slender, much recurved. Each 
upper pharyngeal with a row of about eight conical, sharp, recurved 
teeth ; lower i)haryngeals with a double row of very small teeth. All 
the teeth buried deeply in the gum, only their points \isible. The lower 
pharyngeal bones are very small and slender. A i)rominent short ridge 
between the origin of the lateral line and the tubercles of the hinder 
margin of the upper eye ; from the anterior end of this a long low prom- 
inence runs downwards across the opercular bones, slightly inclining- 
forwards, and ending- level with the row of pores und«}r the eye. Mar- 
gin of the preoi)erculum luiited by the skin to the other opercular bones. 
Gill-rakers very short, flexible, wide apart. Dorsal fin twisted over to 
the left side at a ijoint over the centre of the eye (about ten rays from 
its origin) and continued <lownwards in a curved line to a little below 
the posterior extremity of the n)axillary on that side, the first rays

liigiier than those immediately following. The rays again increase to 
abont the forty-lifth, whei^e the fin forms almost an angle, the rays rap- 
idly diminishing- to its termination opposite that of the anal, at about 
half the depth of the peduncle from the caudal. Anal commencing a 
little behind the base of the pectoral, similar to the dorsal, its longest 
rays about the 23d-2oth, where the fin forms a rounded angle similar to 
that of the dorsal, the rays diminishing thence regularly and rai^idly. 
Longest rays of dorsal and anal about § of the length of the head. Anal 
usually with a small spine ; all the rays of dorsal and anal simple ; those 
behind the longest rays inclined forwards. Caudal rather broad, its 
rays twice bifurcate ; the first bifurcation at about the middle, the sec- 
ond at three-foiu'ths of then" length from the base; posterior margin 
regularly convex. Pectoral rather short ; that of colored side contained 
7^-8i times in the total length, about 1§ times in that of head; that of 
blind side much shorter, about t/W of the length of the head. Rays of 
pectoral of colored side . once l)ifurcate, the two uppermost excepted ; 
those of the blind side undivided. Ventrals ^ of the length of the head, 
their rays undivided, and the tips of the fins extending beyond the ori- 
gin of the anal ; their base very broad, its posterior portion beloAV the 
anterior i)ortion of the pectoral base. Lateral line median on the caudal 
peduncle, and thence forwards to nearly the tip of the ])ectorals, where 
it commences to rise slightly, Avith very small curvature, to its origin. 
Accessory lateral line euding below the 45th-53d ray of the dorsal; that of 
the blind side rather shorter. A line of x>ores commences at the tuber- 
cles on the posterior margin of the upper eye, is continued behind the 
lower eye at some distance from it, and thence along the suborbitals to 
a line with the front of the pupil — about sixteen tubular i>ores. Scales 
rather small, smooth, not imbricated, except on the caudal i)eduncle, but 
imbedded in the skin ; those on cheeks and opercles smaller, and those 
of the left side considerably smaller than those of the right. Snout, 
interocular space, and lower jaw scaleless. Several rows of extremely 
small scales on dorsal and anal rays ; caudal rays with very small scales 
on both sides. Color of a fresh individual dark chocolate-brown, becom- 
ing reddish on the lower part of the head ; after exposure to alcohol the 
color becomes duller, and the scales shoAV distinctly lighter than the siu-- 
rounding skin. Others are olivaceous. All are much lighter when cov- 
ered with mucus. Bhnd side creamy white, in some spotless, in others 
with three or four large, and several smaller, dark -brown blotches on the 
anterior portion of the body. Dorsal and anal fins clouded with dark 
and light olivaceous ; pectoral of colored side dark.

Another sx)ecimeii bad 73 dorsal and 53 anal rays. In consequence of 
the height and size of the prominences round the upper eye, the upper 
orbit is larger than the lower. The species appears to be rare ; Girard 
saw only one specimen, and as yet I have only seen about twelve. It is 
taken outside the bay in deep water, probably near the Farallone Islands. 
The large eyeballs, iirotruding through the diminution of the pressure 
consequent on the removal of the fish to the surface, and overhanging-, 
as it were, the short, snub snout, together with the bright brown tint, 
give this fish an unmistakable physiognomy even when viewed from 
above ; and the curious prolongation of the dorsal on the left side, to- 
gether with the brown markings, render it still more easy to identify 
when the blind side is exposed to \iew. 

Is Fleuronectes qiiadrituherculatus Pall. (Zoog. Eoss.-As. iii, p. 423, 
teste Giinther) identical with the foregoing? The two "approximate, 
anteriorly situated " tubercles may very well be the prominent extremi- 
ties of the interocular ridge ; there is another " at the hinder margin of 
the upper orbit" (with, however, a second above it), and that above the 
opercle is large and prominent. The fin-rays, lateral line, and scales 
agree perfectly well with this species ; but the proportion of depth to 
length is smaller, and " anal si^ine hidden " does not apply to the speci- 
mens of coonosns brought to this market. Yet the i)roportion of the Ijody 
is within the range of variation of some of our other flat-fishes, and the 
anal spine is not j^rominent. It is also a suspicious circumstance that 
no one has ever identified Pallas's species. 

If my surmise should prove correct, coenosus must of com\se sink into 
a synonym, and the name of the species will be Plctironichthi/s quadri- 
tuherculatus. 

In No. 4, the dorsal fin was not continued downwards nearly so far as 
in the others, agreeing thus more closely with Girard's description ; the 
first ray wiis about level with the toj) of the upi^er lip, and only four

rays arose ui)oii the blind side. In the same individual, no anal spine 
was diseoverable outside of the skin ; and the rays of the pectoral on the 
blind side were only ten, and on the colored side twelve. 

In No. 5, no scales were discoverable on the vertical fins. One indi- 
vidual examined had three tubercles in a vertical line along the poste- 
rior margin of the ui)per eye.

mandibles are distorted, their symphyses bent round toward the colored 
side. Teeth small, short, broad, nearly equal, closely set, formirig- a 
nearly continuous cutting edge on the blind side in both jaw^s; about 10 
teeth in the intermaxillary and 45 in the mandible on the blind side, and 
2-3 on the colored side of each jaw, in a specimen 12^" long. Pharyn- 
geal teeth blunt, broad, similar to those of jaws ; each upper pharyngeal 
bone with about 12 teeth; each lower pharyngeal bone with a double 
row of teeth. Lower pharyngeals stout, separate. Gill-rakers of first 
arch rather slender, aboiit one-fourth as long as the eye, the others de- 
creasing regularly to the fourth arch, on Y>'hich they are almost tuber- 
cular. Dorsal commencing over the centre of the pupil of the upper 
eye, considerably behind the posterior nostril of blind side ; the number 
of rays very variable, the longest (oOth-iOth about) more than ^ of the 
length of the head. Anal with a horizontal spine, its first ray arising 
at a vertical about the width of the pectoral base behind the posterior 
pectoral axil; the number of rays very variable; the longest (C. 18-20) 
opposite to those of the dorsal. Dorsal and anal coterminal at a dis- 
tance from the caudal exceeding the depth of the caudal peduncle. 
Caudal truncated posteriorly, the outermost iirincipal rays only very

opened is slightly convex, the rays once bifnrcate only. Pectoral of 
colored side usnally about ^ of the total length; the rays mostly once 
bifurcate, the two first excepted. Pectoral of blind side usually con- 
siderably shorter than that of tlie colored side ; rays bifurcate, except the 
first three. Ventrals inserted with their posterior axil nearly in a line 
with the anterior axil of the base of the pectorals, their posterior ex- 
tremity extending about to the anal spine ; the posterior four rays bifur- 
cate once or twice. Scales very small, smooth, extending over the head

In otlier specimens, the formulte of tliese fins were as follows : D. 77, 
A. GO ; D. 74, A. 57 5 D. 75 ; A. c. 54. Thus tbe number of rays in tlie 
dorsal and anal fins is very variable, and is usually largest in the largest 
individuals, but not invariably so ; the head also becomes slightly longer 
in proportion to the body as the size increases; and the largest speci- 
mens are the most slender. After close examination of several indi- 
viduals, and comparison of many fresh specimens as they lay upon the 
stalls, exposed for sale, I have been forced to the conclusion that there 
is only one species of Farophrijs^ and tfiat the P. hubhardl of Gill and 
the r. (Uyrammus of Gilnther imist sink to the rank of synonyms. 
Farophn/s retulus is of common occurrence in the markets, where it is 
present daily in greater or less abundance. Large specimens are equal 
in length to those of Psettlchthys melanostictus. This species can be 
readily recognized by its narrow form, combined with the straight taper- 
ing lines of the posterior portion of the body, by the narrow anterior 
portion of the head, and by the smooth scales. 

LEPIDOPSETTA Gill.

Form oval ; dorsal profile regularly curved from the frout margin of 
tlie upper eye to the caudal peduncle. Abdominal outline also a regu- 
lar curve from the lower jaw, but less arched than the dorsal. Curve of 
snout uniting with that of nape over the anterior margin of the upper 
eye, forming a concavity. Height of body about f ; length of head rather 
more than i of the total length ; greatest distance from anal to straight 
part of lateral line nearly equal to the length of the head. Snout pro- 
jecting slightly, and considerably shorter than the eye. Eyes rather 
large, elliptical, their longitudinal diameter about f of the length of the 
head, nearly even in Iront ; the upper eye looking obliquely upwards. 
Interorbital space a, very narrow, elevated, bouy ridge, dividing ante- 
riorly, and forming a raised ridge round the anterior margin of qm-Ii eye. 
Nostrils of colored side in a depression about equidistant from the front 
margins of the two orbits ; anterior tubular 5 posterior patulous ; ante- 
rior nostril of blind side with a posterior tongue-like flap. Mouth very 
oblique; Op of mandible level with the upper margin of the lower eye, 
projecting when the mouth is closed, with a prominent symphysial knob. 
Length of mandible contained about 2| times in that of head. Maxil- 
lary reaching but little behind the anterior margin of the orbit of the 
lower eye, and about ~^ of its transverse diameter below its lower margin. 
A single, rather irregular, tolera*bly closely set row of strong, blunt, con- 
ical teeth in each jaw, shorter and less developed on the colored side 
than on the blind. Teeth of intermaxillary not reaching above half-way 
along that bone on the colored side ; those of mandible extenduig along 
§ of the exposed portion of that bone on the same side. About 34 teeth 
in the intermaxillaries, and about 32 in the mandible. Inferior pharyn- 
geal teeth like those of jaws, but stouter, in a double row on each pharyn- 
geal bone, the outer row rather the smaller; about 12 teeth in the inner 
row ; superior similar, in a single row of about 7 on each pharyngeal 
bone. Inferior pharyngeal bones entirely separate, stout, broadest in 
the centre of their length, where the rows of teeth are farthest apart. 
Dorsal commencing immediately behind the anterior margin of the orbit; 
its first ray twisted toward the left, increasing regularly to about the 
38th-40th rays, which are about ^ of the length of the head, thence 
diminishing regularly to its termination opposite to that of the anal and 
distant from the caudal about half the width of its peduncle. Anal with 
a spine, its origin a little behind the base of the pectoral, its longest 
rays opposite to and equal in length to those of the dorsal ; behind the 
longest rays the depth of the fin diminishes regularly. Narrowest part 
of caudal peduncle rather more than 4 of the greatest de])t]i, thence 
widening to the caudal without the intervention of a straight portion. 
Principal rays of caudal once bifurcate ; its posterior margin slightly

convex. Pectorals pointed ; that of colored side with 11-12 rays, the 
lon<;est ahont -^^ of the length of the head ; all the rays, except the first 
two, once hifnrcate. Pectoral of blind side with 10-11 rays, the longest 
abont § as long as those of the colored side ; the three or fonr lowest 
rays once bifurcate. Ventrals more than half their length in advance 
of the i)ectorals (reckoning from the front margins of both tins), con- 
tained about 3\ times in the length of the head ; the three posterior rays 
bifurcate. Gill-rakers short, very llexible, few, and widely sei)arated. 
Scales of the anterior jiart of the body separate and almost circular, but 
towards the central i)ortion they slightly overlap, and on the posterior 
portion are strongly imbricated. By far the larger portion of the scales 
on the anterior portion of the body and along the dorsal and abdominal 
regions, almost all those on the sub- and inter-opercula, a large propor- 
tion of those on operculum, and some of those on the suborbital region 
smooth, subcircuhir. On the central portion of the length, especially 
near the lateral line, scales with two or three spinules appear, and these 
become more numerous and more decidedly ctenoid farther backwards, 
extending quite across the body on its posterior third. Scales of cheeks 
not imbricated, similar in shape to those of body ; the posterior portion 
of their surface covered with numerous spinules (number variable) di- 
rected upwards. Near the interorbital space these spinules cover the 
greater portion of each scale. These spinulose scales extend upwards 
level with tlie u])per m;irgin of the upper eye'; and there are numerous 
scales of a similar character on the operculum, and sometimes a few upon 
the sub- and inter-oi)ercula. A few isolated scales below the pectoral 
resemble those on the cheeks. Each of the scales on the cheeks with a 
distinct pit, producing a punctate appearance. In some specimens spin- 
ulose scales are scattered over the anterior jiarts. Scales of blind side 
smooth; preoperculum scaleless. Accessory lateral line of A^ariable 
length, connected with the main lateral line by a branch and sometimes 
with a short separate row of pores above ; accessory lateral line of blind 
side shorter. Lateral line Avith a bold curve, six scales high (in an ob- 
lique row) above pectoral, anteriorly decurrent to nearly its former direc- 
tion. A row of pores round the lower eye. Kays of the caudal covered 
with scales on both blind and (colored sides. A row of scales along the 
greater portion of the length of the central rays of the dorsal on the col- 
ored side and on a portion of the anal, but no scales upon the anterior or 
l)Osterior rays of either fin on that side, nor on either dorsal or anal on the 
blind side. The scales of the body are largest on the posterior portion 
and on the caudal peduncle, where they are elongated, and measure 
about ;jT,- in length. Color liglit grayish, yellowish, or reddish brown, 
with irregularly placed blotches of whitish on the body; often with five 
large light blotches along the dorsal and five along the abdominal mar- 
gin. Blind side white. Dorsal tin sometimes with blotches on colored 
side.

The accessory lateral line varies coiisideral»ly. In No. 1, it can be 
traced to below the fortieth dorsal ray; the portion anterior to the 
branch connecting it with the main lateral line runs obliqnely npwards 
to immediately below the sixth dorsal ray ; and there is a short line of 
abont eleven pores above the principal accessory lateral line, commenc- 
ing at the tenth dorsal ray and coutinning- to the fifteenth. In Xo. 2, 
there is no second accessory row of pores, and the accessory lateral line 
terminates l)etween the fifteenth and sixteenth dorsal rays. Anteriorly 
this line divides and again unites, surrounding a small space, and then 
again divides into two branches, the lower of which receives the con- 
necting branch from the main lateral line. In No. 3, the accessory lat- 
eral line ends just behind the sixteenth dorsal ray, and has two branches 
inclined upward, the anterior surrounding a space. On the blind side of 
No. 4, I could only find ten pectoral rays. On the blind side of Nos. 4 
and 5, the accessory lateral line, which ends under the 14th dorsal ray, 
curves boldly downwards and then backwards to meet the main lateral 
line, and sends a short branch oblirpiely forwards. On the colored side 
the arrangement is similar in No. 5; but in No. 4 a space is surrounded 
by the pores at the junction of the dorsal accessory with the branch 
leading to the lateral line. 

This large mottled "Sole" (as it is called) is taken outside of the bay, 
usually, if I am rightly informed, in the vicinity of the Farallones, and 
is rather rare. TLose Isrought in are usually of tolerably large size, the 
specimens measured being of about average dimensions. It is reputed 
of delicate flavor. It may be readily recognized l)y its light yellow tint, 
with white markings, its regularly oval form, and its extremely narrow 
interocular .space. 

The fornmlcB of the dorsal and anal in the individuals measured were 
as follows : No. 1, D. 78, A. 57 ; No. 2, D. 70, A. 61 ; No. 3, D. 71, A. 55; 
No. 4,.D. 7C, A. 01 ; No. 5, D. 84, A. 03.

eye; the surface Hat, not ele%'ated, without ridges or tubercles. IMouth 
small, its cleft obli<pie ; lower jaw projecting in the closed mouth, and 
level with the upper margin of the lower eje; maxillary ending about 
half-way between the front margin of the orbit and that of the pupil. 
Teeth in a single row on both sides of both jaws; about 14 on the 
colored and 23 on the blind side of the mandible, and 20 on the colored 
and 23 on the blind side of the intermaxillaries in a specimen a little 
over 9" long. Teeth conical, rather short and stout ; the largest in front 
of both jaws, the smallest on the colored side of the intermaxillary. 
Upper pharyngeal teeth in a single row of G-8 teeth similar to those in 
jaws; lower pharyngeals separate, each Avith a double row of similar 
teeth. Gill-rakers short, flexible ; branchiostegals seven. Dorsal com- 
mencing above anterior margin of eye ; the first ray slightly turned 
to the left at its origin; the longest rays (about the 38th-4Sth) about 
equal in length to the pectoral of the right side, thence decreasing 
regularly to its termination, opposite to that of anal, at a distance 
from the caudal equal to about half the depth of the i)eduucle. Anal 
with a more or less conspicuous spine, very slowly increasing in height 
to the 30th-3Sth rays, which are equal in length and opposite to the 
longest dorsal rays. By far the larger portion of the rays of the dorsal 
and anal are directed backwards. Origin of anal considerably behind 
the pectoral base. Greatest depth between anal and straight portion of 
lateral line somewhat less than the length of the head. Caudal pedun- 
cle slightly wedge-shaped; caudal convex posteriorly, the central rays 
considerably longest ; outer ray about ^, secoud ray about f , the length

of the third ray ou each side ; rays usually only once bifurcate. Ven- 
trals small ; their posterior axil about half the width of the pectoral base 
in advance of the anterior axU of that fin, their tips extendinji' beyond 
the anus ; four lower rays bifurcate. Pectoral of colored side lanceolate, 
about half the length of the head ; third ray longest, second slightly 
shorter ; all the rays but the three uppermost once bifurcate. Pectoral 
of blind side shorter, the central rays longest ; most of the rays once 
bifurcate. Scales of body and cheeks ctenoid, the spines w^ll developed, 
1 hose on the cheeks similar; no stellate or rugose scales on any part. 
Small ctenoid scalesi on interorbital area ; snout and loAver jaw scaleless. 
A row of ctenoid scales along each ray of dorsal and anal fins on the 
colored side, except upon a few of the anterior rays and those posterior 
ones which incKne forwards. The scales extend to the tips of the rays. 
Similar scales upon the colored side of the caudal for the greater portion 
of the length, and some on the outside of the pectoral. Scales of blind 
side smooth; preopercular bone scaleless; the other opercular bones

This species is not brought to market in large numbers, and is sold 
under the name of " Sole." Those I liaA^e seen on the stalls average about 
the same size as those of which the measurements are given. In No. 5, 
the lateral line is almost straight. It is easily distinguished by its 
highly ctenoid scales of uniform character, its small eyes, and dull gray 
color. 

It is evident from the dimen^sions of the various species given in the 
preceding pages, that the number of dorsal and anal fin-rays and the 
proportional width of the interocular space are subject to great varia- 
tion in all tlie species. I am inclined to believe that^ as a rule, the inter- 
ocular space increases in proportional width with the age of the fish, 
shice, although two fishes of the same size may differ in this respect, or 
the smaller of two not greatly difl'eriug in size may have the wider inter- 
orbital area, yet very large specimens invariably have this space rela- 
tively wider than very small ones. The number of pectoral rays is also 
inconstant. 

I much regret that, as I have only seen one specimen of the Hippo- 
fjlossus of this coast, I am at present unable to settle the question of its 
identity with the European species ; but I expect to be able to do this 
before many months have passed. 

In conclusion, I hove to thank "Mr. W. G. W. Harford, the Director of 
the Museum of the California Academy of Sciences, for his courtesy and 
his assistance in many ways.

TaO."VS OF A NEW GENU'S AIV» THREE NEW SPECIES. 

By O. BRO^'i'JV QOO£>E. 

In the following list are enumerated the species of fishes known, or 
supposed to occur, in the waters of East Florida. Those which have 
not been observed by the writer, or by other recent explorers, are marked 
by asterisks. The occurrence of all these species is almost absolutely 
certain, for, with one or two exceptions, they have been taken on the 
Atlantic coast north of Florida, and to the south and west in the Oulf 
of Mexico or the Antilles. Any information regarding the occurrence 
of these or otlier species in East Florida is solicited. 

In a more extended paper, now almost ready for the press, the habits, 
geographical distribution, and economical history of these species will 
be discussed. Of the 223 species here catalogued, 33 only have been 
taken north of Cape Cod.

169. Jordanella floridas, gen. et sp. nov., Goode & Bean. 

Three specimens, of a remarkable type, allied to Cyprinodon^ were 
collected in Lake Monroe, Florida, by Professor Baird (No. 18062), 
associated with C. variegatus. The species appears to be generically 
distinct from Cyprinodon., and the genus, for which the name Jordanella 
is proposed, in honor of Prof. D. S. Jordan, is characterized by its long 
dorsal and anal fins, the dorsal having IG rays, preceded by a stout, 
thick spine, the anal I, 12 or 13, and by the position of the ventrals, 
which are situated in advance of the dorsal, and also by the advanced 
position of the anal, the posterior end of which is in advance of that 
of the dorsal. In other respects it agrees with Cyprinodon. 

The species may be characterized as follows: 

Diagnosis. — Height of body contained 2^^ to 2^ times in total length 
without caudal (2.J to 2^ times with caudal). Humeral scale behind gill- 
opening equal to or little larger than the others. Snout as in Cyprinodon 
variegatus. Diameter of eyes contained 3 J times in length of head, and 
equal to | of the width of the interorbital space. Origin of dorsal mid- 
way between end of snout and base of caudal, and above the ninth or 
tenth scale of the lateral line, and is behind the vertical from the root 
of the ventrals. Pectoral as long as the caudal, and § as long as the 
head. The ventral reaches to the vent, its length equal to half that of 
the head. The origin of the anal is under the fifth dorsal ray, and its 
posterior ray is in advance of the last dorsal ray. Mandible about as 
long as the eye. The sexual characters cannot be made out from the 
series of specimens studied by us. Color olivaceous above, yellowish 
brown below, with traces of vertical bands of blackish brown, and with 
longitudinal lines upon each series of scales, resembling those in Mol- 
lienesia, but less conspicuous. A blackish blotch upon the side, under 
the origin of the dorsal, and about as large as the eye; a sinaller one on 
the posterior limb of the dorsal.

173. Fuudulus confluentus, sp. nov., Goode it. Boan. 

A single specimen (Xo. 18005) obtained by Professor Baird in Lake 
Monroe. 

Height of body a little less than four times in total length (without 
caudal) ; length of head two-sevenths. Head low, flat. Snout not pro- 
duced, its length equal to that of the eye. Mandible equal to the eye. 
Width of interorbital space half that of the head. Diameter of eye con- 
tained four times in length of head, and twice in width of interorbital 
space. Origin of the dorsal midway between the tip of the caudal and 
the middle of the eye. First anal ray under second dorsal ray. Anal 
higher than long. Yellowish gray, with longitudinal lines down the 
center of each dorsal and lateral row of scales, and with fourteen or more 
distinct, irregular, vertical bands. In general appearance it resembles 
Hydrargyra majalis. The scales are nmch crowded, there being at least 
45 transverse rows of scales. There appear to be only five branchioste- 
gals, though this point is not certainly ascertained, the specimen being 
imi)erfect.

Xumerous si)ecimens (Xo. 21308) obtained in the Arlington Eiver. 

Height of body contained four times in total length, without caudal; 
the length of the head three and one-third. Snout broad, lower jaw 
juojecting. Diameter of eye much greater than length of snout 
(double in young), one-third to two-fifths (in yoiTUg) of that of the head, 
and two-thirds the width of the interorbital space. My specimens 
appear to be both females. In them the origin of the dorsal is midway 
between the tip of the tail and the posterior margin of the eye and 
opposite the sixth anal ray. The pectoral fins extend to the vertical 
from the insertion of the ventrals, which terminate at the vent and in 
front of the anal ; length of base of anal equal to half its distance from 
the insertion of the caudal. Color iiniform brownish olive. In the 
smaller specimens two or three series of blackish dots on the dorsal and 
anal fins.

By G. BROWN GOODE aead TARI.ETOIV II. BEAN. 

The pnblication of the following- list of fishes, collected by Mr. Stearns 
in the vicinity of Pensacola, Florida, is a preliminary step to the work of 
identifying and describing the large collections from the Gnlf of Mexico 
now in the possession of the National Musenm. 

The fishes enumerated below were obtained in the winters of 1877-8 
and 1878-9 by Mr. Stearns in the leisure hours of an active business life. 
Many of the larger species were forwarded to Washington in ice, and 
casts of them have been made in plaster. Mr. Stearns has usually sent 
interesting notes with each specimen, relating to the life-history of the 
species. We have refrained from publishing these, hoping that he will 
himself give them to science in a more complete form. 

The common names published are those in use at Pensacola. The 
numbers in parentlieses following the Museum catalogue numbers refer 
to Mr. Stearns's collecting record. 

Smithsonian Institution, WasMngton, May 27, 1879. 



1. MALTHEID^. 

1. Malthe cubifrons Eichardson. 

A single specimen, IS'o. 22,833, was sent by Mr. Stearns. The Museum 
lias other specimens from West Florida — ^Nos. 21,407, 5,708, and 20,485. 
The radial formula in all is D. 4; A. 4; Y. I, 5; P. 13. No. 21,407 is 
12^ inches long, an enormous size for this fish. 



122 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



2. DIODONTIDJ^. 

2. Chilomycterus geometricus (Linn.) Kaup.— P«.f-/(.s/(. 

Two specimens, No. 21,492 (01), in alcohol, each about 6 inches in 
length, were sent; also a beach-dried specimen, No. 21,331 (19), some- 
what longer. The coloration of the alcoholic specimen is peculiar, and 
it might at first sight be thought to belong to variety y as defined by 
Giinther. The groundcolor is very dark, but a close examination reveals 
the irregularly parallel longitudinal lines characteristic of the species in 
its typical form. 

3. TETRODONTID^. 

3. Cirrisomus ttirgidus (Mitch.) Jordan &c Gilbert.— Toad-fish. 

A single specimen, Xo. 21,195 (51), 5i| inches in length. 

4. Lagocephalus laevigatas (Linn. )G ill. 

A single specimen, 19 inches in length, No. 22,807. D. 11; A. 12; 
P. 16. Caudal deeply forked. Spines 4-rooted. Length of head less 
than its distance from dorsal, and contained 3g times in length without 
caudal. 

4. OSTRACIONTID^. 

5. Ostracion quadricornis Linn. — Coic-fish. 
A single specimen, No. 21,310. 

5. BALISTIDiE. 

6. Alutera Schcspfii (Wall).) Gootle & Beau. 

A specimen, No. 0,008, 10 inches in length, was sent from Cedar Keys, 
ria., by Judge Steele, about 1804. D. 32; A. 35; P. 12; C. 12. 

7. Monacauthus occideutalis Giinther, 

A bottle. No. 9,080, containing numerous specimens of this species, is 
labelled "Cedar Key, West Florida," and another. No. 5,808, contains 
two specimens from Charlotte Harbor, collected by C. B. Baker. This 
species doubtless occm-s at Pensacola. 

No. 5,808(^0. D. 31; A. 29. 
No. 5,808 (Z>). D. 35; A. 32. 
Monacmithm spilonotus, described by Cope* from the Gulf of Mexico, 
should also be looked for in this region. 

8. Balistes capriscus Linn. — Leather Jacket. 

A fine specimen, No. 21,220 (4), 21 inches in length.

6. HIPPOCAMPIDJE. 

9. Hippocampus aiitiquorum Liun. — Sea Horse. 

A single specimen was received from Mr. Steams, No. 21,335 (15). 
The Museum possesses another, Ko. 0,933, from Pensacohi, received 
from an unknown contributor. 

In Xo. 0,933, a female, the head is contained 5i times in total length. 
There are 12 body rings and 31 caudal rings. 

No. 21,335, a female, is a dried specimen in bad order, which appears 
to agree essentially with No. 0,933. It has 12 body rings and 33 caudal 
rings, and 19 rays in the dorsal. 

7. SYNGNATHIDJE. 

10. Syngnathus sp. 

A single individual, too young for identification, was sent by Mr. 
Stearns. 

8. SOLEIDJE. 

11. Achirus lineatus (Linn.) Cuvier. — "Flounder." 

Two specimens w^ere received. These are remarkable in the fact that 
the ventral surfaces are immaculate, while all specimens of this species 
from the Eastern and Middle States are strongly maculated with black 
or brown, exce^it a few from the Potomac River. Others from the Poto- 
mac are maculated. How is it with the species on the South Atlantic 
coast •?

in length. D. 78 ; A. 54 : P. I, 10 ; C. 17 ; Y. 0. L. lat. 47 ; L. trans. i|. 

No. 18,054, an individual 3f inches long, was received from mouth 
of St. John's Eiver, Fla., through Pro£ S. F. Baird. D. 81 ; A. 04 ; P. I, 
8; 0. 17 ; Y. 0. L. lat. 47 ; L. trans. f|. 

Giinther's types, from Babia, Santo Domingo, New Orleans, Jamaica, 
and West Africa, had the following radial formulie : D. 70-7S ; A. 00-03 ; 
L. lat. 47-50. Gill's type, from Beesley's Point, had the following : D. 
81 ; A. 58 ; C. 18 ; P. 10 ; Y. 0. L. lat. 42 ; L. trans. \i ?1 

Our specimens agree very satisfactorily with both diagnoses, except 
in the number of transverse rows of scales, as given by Gill. 

13. Pseiidorhombus dentatus (Liun.) Giintlior. — Flounder. 

Two specimens. No. 21,340 (21), were received. That the Flounder of

14. Pseudorhombus quadrocellatus (Gill) Jordan. 

AncylopseUa qnadrocellata Gill, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Pliila. 1864, p. 224. 

This species was originally described from specimens obtained at 
Pensacola. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 127 



10. BATRACHID^. 

15. Batrachus tau Linn. — "Sarpo"; Sea jRohin. 

A specimen of this species, No. 21,477 (27), corresponds closely in 
coloration with the southern specimens referred to by Giinther. 

Other individnals were obtained, which had grown to the size of 12 
or 15 inches, and which, if coloration were accepted as a mark of specific 
rank, would surely be entitled to description as new species. The ground- 
color is gray or yellowish white, coA'ered with large irregular blotches and 
small roundish spots of brown. The type of coloration is very different 
from that described by Giinther from southern specimens in the British 
Museum. A fuller description of these specimens with measurements 
will be given hereafter. 

11. GOBIID^. 

16. Gobius soporator Cuv. & Val. 

A single specimen, No. 22,852, 2^ inches in length, of a species of 
Gohius, was sent by Mr. Stearns. It is so shrivelled up from immersion 
in too strong alcohol that its characters are not very clearly to be made 
out. It agrees very w^ell with the descriptions of Gobius sojjorator, and 
is very like specimens of that species from the Bermudas, except that 
the fins are blackish, and, unlike the Bermuda specimens, show no spots. 

17. Eleotris gyriiius Cuv. & Val. 

A single specimen, No. 22,853, of an Uleofris, agrees essentially with 
the descriptions of JE. gyrinus and with specimens sent under this name 
from Cuba by Professor Poey. 

12. TRIGLID^. 

18. Dactylopterus volitans (Liun.) Lac. 

A single specimen, G^- inches in length, and measuring between the 
tips of the extended fins 8 J inches. D. I, IV, I, 8; A. 6; P. 0, 22; V. 7; 
C. 5, 4. 

In the young, the proportional length of the preopercular spines is 
greater than in the adult, equalling the greatest width of the head. 
The scales upon the flauks are conspicuously carinate, in the first and 
fourth rows from the abdominal flat surface showing a tendency to form 
strong ridges upon the sides of the body. The first and second rays of 
the first dorsal are separated from the other rays of this fin, and when 
the fin is closed and resting in the dorsal groove the first roy falls back 
upon the dorsal surface upon the right-hand side, the second upon the 
left embracing the fin. These rays resemble filaments, and it seems 
probable that they have independent motion, like the filaments of 
Lojihius. They are never received into the dorsal groove. The fins are 



128 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

dark, and show no traces of the circular blue spots often seen in individ- 
uals of this species. The colors are dull and little conspicuous. 

19. Prionotus tribulus Cuv. & Val. 

A single individual, No. 22,820, 5| inches in length. D. X, 12; A. 10; 
P. 13 + 3; V.I, 5; C. 4 + 11 + 3. 

13. POLYNEMID^. 

20. Polynemus octonemus Girard. 

Several specimens of this interesting species were obtained, notes upon 
which are given below. 

No. 22,821 (70). Length 4^ inches. D. II, VI, I, 12 ; A. II, 12 ; P.

22. Orcynus aUiteratus (Raf.) Gill. 

A single specimen. No. 22,815 (92), 13 inches long, weighing f of a 
pound, was sent by Mr. Stearns. 

This specimen is interesting as being the only young indi^idual taken 
on this side of the Atlantic. 

A few irregularly distributed dark spots about the size of the pupil 
of the eye occur on the sides of the body below the pectoral. 

23. Cybium maciilatum (MitcMll) Cuvier. — Spanish Mackerel. 

A single specimen. No. 21,333 (35), 14^ inches in length, was sent 
by Mr. Stearns. There are about fifteen large spots between the 
branchial opening and the base of the caudal. D. 18 + 17, VII; A. IG,

A young specimen. No. 7,310, 9^ inches long, was sent from West 
Florida by C. B. Baker.

33. Caulolatilus microps Goode & Bean. 

The Smithsoniau lustitution received, Marcli 22, 1878, tliis fisli from 
Mr. Stearns. It was taken Marcli 18, 1878, on the Snapper Bauk, off 
PensacoLa, in 35 fathoms of water. It is now a fine alcoholic specimen, 
Xo. 20,971 of the Fish Catalogne. 

Caulolatilus microps is related to the Brazilian form Canlolatilus cliry- 
sops (Cu\ier and Valenciennes) Gill, and the Cnban form Caulolatilus 
cyanops Poey, described in 18G7.* Of the former, two specimens only 
are recorded: one, the type of the original description, one foot long, 
collected on the coast of Brazil by M. Gay, and probably now in the 
mnsenm in Paris; a second, in the British Mnsenm, a stnfi'ed specimen, 
pnrporting to have been collected in the West Indies. Of Poey's 
C. cyanops, the National Museum possesses a fine specimen (Cat. No. 
4,750), 15 inches long, collected and presented by Professor Poey. 

The Pensacola specimen is 2 feet and 3 inches long, weighing 9^ 
pounds. Its color has faded, but a yellow blotch is still visible under 
the eye, similar to that mentioned in C. chrysops. A dark blotch is 
visible in and above the axilla of the pectoral.

42. Euciiiostomus harengulus sp. uov. Goode & Bean. 

There are in the collection two specimens of an undescribed Eucino- 
stomns collected in West Florida by Kaiser and Martin. The catalogue 
number of the specimens is 5145. The largest is 1 20 millimetres in len gth 
to the origin of the middle caudal rays ; the smaller, 87 millime- 
tres. The species may be briefly characterized as follows : D. IX, 10 ; 
A. Ill, 7 ; P. 15 ; Y. I, 5 ; C. +17+. L. lat. 44; L. trans. {%. 

The height of the body is contained 3 to 3^ times in the total length 
without caudal ; the length of the head, 3^^ to 3J times ; the diameter 
of the eye exceeds the length of the snout, and is contained 3 times in 
the length of the head, and equals the width of the interorbital si)ace. 
The groove for the processes of the intermaxillaries is naked, and ex- 
tends to the vertical through the anterior third of the eye. The free 
portion of the tail is longer than high. The least height of tail equals 
the length of the Gth dorsal spine. The 3d dorsal spine is the longest, 
its length being contained twice in the height of the body, and equals 
the length of the head without the postorbital portion ; the last dorsal 
spine equals in length the 2d anal, and about equals the length of the 
snout, and is about f as long as the 3d. The 1st dorsal ray is fully 
1^ times as long as the 1st dorsal spine. The 2d anal spine is 
stronger and shorter than the 3d, its length being contained 3| times 
in the length of the head. The 3d anal spine is contained 3;V times in 
the length of the head. The caudal is forked, its length slightly less 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 133 

than the length of tlie bead, and very little greater than the length of 
the pectoral. The pectoral reaches to the peqiendicnlar through the 
origin of the soft dorsal. The ventral is half as long as the head. 
The vent is under the 2d ray of the soft dorsal.

We have examined several specimens of a species of Pagrus ol)tained 
at Charleston, S. C, in April, 1878, by Mr. Goode, and also a si)ecimen, 
No. 21,339, sent from Pensacola by Mr. Stearns. We are unable to dis- 
cover any differences between this species and P. argenteus of Eiu'ope, 
and pro\isionally identify them with it. The discovery of this European 
form in the Western Atlantic is particularly interesting.

46. Pagellus Milneri sp. nov. Goode & Bean. 

Two speciiiions of an undescribed species of Pagellus, jSTo. G,134, were 
seiit from Charlotte Harbor, Florida, in 18G3, by C. B. Baker. The 
length of the smaller specimen to the origin of the middle caudal rays 
is l-iG™'"; of the larger, 150'>^'^. The species is dedicated to our friend 
Mr. James W. Milner, for eight years Deputy U. S. Commissioner of 
Fisheries, whose important services to the United States in the depart- 
ment of Fish Culture have been supplemented by much thorough natural 
history exploration, and who at this time is collecting the fishes of West 
Florida. 

BiagnoHis. — The height of the body is 2| in total length, caudal in- 
cluded; 24 in its length Avithout caudal. Length of head 4^ times with 
caudal, 34- without, and equal to length of pectoral. Diameter of eyeequals 
length of operculum ; width of interorbital space equals least height of

tail, Avliicli is half tlie lengtli of the ventral. Diameter of eye iu length 
of head almost 4 times, and less than 1^ times in snout. Preorbital 
nearly as high as it is long, with maxillary edge nearly straight. There 
are five series of scales between the preorbital and the angle of the pre- 
opercnlum. Three series of molars in upper Jaw, two in lower. Poste- 
rior nostril linear. In life this species is banded vertically with brown.

A fine specimen, No. 21,330, 26 inches long, was sent from Pensacola 
by Mr. Stearns in May, 1878, which served as one of the types for the 
descrii^tion of the sj)ecies. 

A yonng individnal. No. 21,403, was also sent, which shows some 
interesting variations from the adult, as indicated in the following- 
table of measurements. 

The principal characters of the young as varying from the adult are 
(1) the greater length of the head, (2) the lesser length of the snout, 
(3) the greater diameter of the eyes, (4) the greater length of the paired 
fins, (5) the greater height of the azygos fins, (6) the stouter proportions 
of the caudal.

The description of Bodiamis palUdus as given by Mitchill does not 
appear to us to apply to this species, and we cannot believe that our 
friend Prof. Jordan had the book before him when he made his linal 
decision in the matter. Indeed, this is quite evident from the fact that he 
habitually quotes it in synonymy as Labrus paUUJus ]\Iitchill. It seems 
to us quite evident that Mitchill's species was BairdieUa argi/roleuca 
{ = B. punctata Gill), as was long ago demonstrated by Prof. Gill. It 
was a whitish, elongated fish, with " holes under the chin," yellow fins, 
23 rays in the second dorsal fin, and 2 (uot 3) si)ines in the anal. See 
Transactions of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Xew York, I, 
1875, p. 420. 

54. Eupomotis speciosus (Holbrook) Jordan ? 

A species represented by a single specimen, distinguished from the 
Eupomotis speciosus of the St. John's Eiver solely by its slenderer body, 
slightly larger eyes, and the presence of only 9 dorsal spines. The 
markings are very similar to those of Eupomotis speciosus. The char- 
acters separating E. speciosus from E. pallid us appear to us of doubtful 
weight.

58. Trisotropis falcatus Poey. — Scamj). 

The United States National Museum reeeived, March 24, 1879, from 
Mr. Sihis Stearns, of Pensacoki, Fla., a fresh individual, No. 22,230, of a 
species of Trisotropis, called " Scamp " by the tishermeu. The weight of 
the fisli is 7^ pounds. 

]Mr. Stearns's collecting- number is 117. He states that it was captured 
in deep water, aiul is abundant "in spots." He has seen individuals 
three times as large as the present one. 

Diagnosis. — A. Trisotro^ns with the body moderately' compressed, its 
greatest depth nearly equal to J of its length ^ ithout caudal, and exactly 
equal to twice the length of the pectoral; the length of the head equal 
to f of the greatest depth of body, and to 4 times the length of the 
snout ; the lower jaw i)rojecting beyond the upper for a distance which 
equals i of the long diameter of the eye ; the 11th ray of the soft dorsal, 
the oth and 0th rays of the aual, the external and 5 of the internal caudal 
rays produced 5 the vent in the vertical from the 10th dorsal spine; the 
pectoral reaching the vertical let fall from the 7th dorsal spine; the 
^'entrals as long as the pectorals, and reaching to the vertical let fall 
from the 8th dorsal spine ; the maxilla extending to and the mandible 
beyond the vertical through the posterior margin of the orbit ; the dis- 
tance of the eye from the upper profile of the head equal to J of its short 
diameter ; the long diameter of the eye contained tMice in the length of 
the snout, and Oi times in the length of the head ; the Oth dorsal spine 
longest, and equal to the distance from the border of the preoperculum 
to the end of the opercular Hap ; the 1st dorsal spine § as long as the last 
and half as long as the od and 4th ; the longest (11th) ray of the soft dor- 
sal equal to the 1st ray of the anal ; the longest (5th) anal ray slightly 
exceeding the length of the pectoral and ventral; 3 rays in the upper 
half, and 2 in the lower half of the caudal produced, the longest of these 
extending beyond the general outline of the rays for a distance equal to 
the 3d anal spine; the external caudal rays nearly twice as long as the 
middle rays ; the 1st dorsal consisting of 11 spines, the 2d dorsal of 17 
rays ; the anal having 3 spines and 11 rays; the caudal, about 20 rays ; 
the pectoral, 1 undivided ray ; the ventral, 1 spine and 5 rays ; the 
uumber of rows of scales between the upper angle of the operculum and 
tlie origin of the middle caudal rays 120 ; about 25 scales in a trans- 
verse series from the beginning of the spinous dorsal to the lateral line, 
and al)out 43 from thence to the lower profile of the body ; the posterior 
nostril three times as long and tvvice as wide as the anterior, and scarcely 
its own length from the eye ; the 3 opercular s]uues broad, flat and cleft 
at the free ends. 

Teeth: Vomerines brush-like, in an angular patch; palatines similar 
and in a single series ; internuixillary teeth in a single series, with a 
short band at the symphysis; 4 canines; mandibulary teeth in two 
series ; several canines at the symphysis.

59. Trisotropis niicrolepis sp. nov. Goode & Bean. 

Two iiidividuals of an apparently nndescribed species of Tn'sofropis 
were collected in West Florida in 1804 by Messrs. Kaiser and Martin. 



142 PROCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

They are closely related to that groui^ of fishes known in Cuba by the 
common name "Al)a(lejo" ("Codlish"), and represented by Poey's species 
Trisofrojns intcrsfiiialis and T. dimidiatus. With the description of the 
former,* it corresponds except in the greater length of the head and the 
mnch greater number of the scales. 

Diagnosis. — The length of the head is contained 2h to 2f times in the 
length to origin of middle caudal rays. Eye contained to 0^ times 
in the head. The maxilla extends to the perpendicular through i)oste- 
rior margin of orbit; upper jaw equals length of anal base ; it is contained 
2\ times in the length of the head. Tlie mandible extends beyond the 
perpeudicular through the jjosterior margin of the orbit, and is slightly 
more than one-half the length of tlie head. Each jaw has two canines. 
The iutermaxillaries have an inner band of villiform and an outer series 
of large, slender, conical teeth curved inward. At the sym])hysis are 
some long slender teeth pointing backwards and movable. The lower 
jaw has two series of sleiuler conical teeth, the inner being the larger 
and movable. The head of the vomer is supplied with very small villi- 
form teeth. A narrow ban<l of similar teeth on the palatines. Preoper- 
culum finely denticulated on its posterior margin and with coarser den- 
ticulatious at the angle. The length of the intermaxillary is contained 
3 times in that of the lower jaw. Pectoral extends to the 9th spine of 
1st dorsal and the ventral as far. The distance from the ventral to the 
vent slightly exceeds that from the vent to the origin of the anal. The 
length of the 1st dorsal spine is slightly more than that of the 2d; the 
3d and 4th are the longest; the last dorsal spine is slightly longer 
Than the one preceding it. The 1st anal spine is about ^ as long as the 
last, which is more slender and longer than the 2d. The tail seems to 
be truncate. The height of the body is contained 3i times in the length 
to the origin of the middle caudal rays.

60. Trisotropis brunneus Voej.— Black Grouper. 

A single species of the genus Trisotroins is given in Professor Gill's 
Catalogue of the Fishes of the East Coast of North America (p. 28), the 
Trisotropis aciitirostris (Cuvier & Valenciennes) Gill. Since there is no 
specimen of this species in the National Museum, and no record of the 
occurrence of this species on our coast, we challenge its right to a place 
among the fishes of our east coast. It was described from the coast of 
Brazil", and has not been satisfactorily identified since its first description, 
which was very inadequately written. 

In Mr. Goode's " Catalogue of the Fishes of the Bermudas," the Ber- 
muda Eock-fish is identified* as Trisotropis umhaosus (Cuv.) Gill. A 
more extended study ^Yith comparisons shows that this name cannot 
fairly be retained for any Bermuda species. T. undulosus was originally 
described by Cuvier and Valenciennes from Brazil.! The only distinct- 
ive character recorded by those authors is the coloration ; all others 
mentioned apply with equal force to any other member of the genus. 

* BuUctiji of tlie U. S. National Museum, No. 5, p. 55. 
tllistoire Naturellc ties PoLssons, ii, 1829, p. 295. 



144 PROCEEDINGS OF UITITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Dr. Giintlier's characters for T. undulosm and Professor Poey's for T. 
hrunneus are little better, since no diagnostic points are evident. 

Since the Floridau and Cuban faunas are so similar, desiring to avoid 
a multiplication of specific names, we provisionally refer the Florida 
specimens before us to Poey's T. hrunneus until we have an opportunity 
to compare them with si^ecimens identified by that author. These had 
been hitherto identified with T. acutirostris. 

We have studied three specimens, No. 15,4G2, sent by Mr. Blackford, 
from New York market. No. 16,902, obtained by Mr. J. H. Richard in 
Washington market, and No. 21,330 (32), sent by Mr. Stearns from Pen- 
sacola in 1878. Full measurements of these specimens are given below.

66. Echeueis naucrateoides Zuiew. — Sucker. 

A young individual, No. 21,482 (13), 6 mches in length, remarkable 
from the tact that the tip of the caudal fin is cuneate in outline. The 
coloration is much the same as in adult individuals of the species, except 
that the white on the dorsal, anal, and caud?il fins is more conspicuous 
and occupies a wider area. The dorsal and anal fins are essentially 
white, with the spaces at the base of the fins and between each pair of 
rays of the same color with the darkest portion of the body. The white 
areas upon the high anterior portions of the dorsal and anal occupy 
more than half of the height of these fins. Upon the posterior portion 
of these fins, the white area is reduced to a marginal line. The white 
patches on the outer angles of the caudal fin are so arranged that the 
dark jjortion of this fin is outlined upon the white in a lanceolate form. 
The pectoral fins are lightly margined with white posteriorly \ D..XXI,

29. SPHYR^NID^. 

67. Sphyreena picuda. 

We have made a preliminary study of the specimens of Spliyrama in 
tlie National Museum, which has convinced us that the number of scales 
in the lateral line is very variable, and must be used with caution as a 
specific character. 

We recognize three species on our coast : 

1. Sphym'na jncuda, with comparatively large scales, 81 or more in the 
lateral line, and the dorsal inserted far in advance of the middle of the 
body, and in front of the vertical from the tip of the pectoral. We have 
seen this species from Cuba, the Bermudas, from West Florida (collected 
by Dr. J. W. Velie), and from South Florida (sent by Mr. E. G. Black- 
ford), a large individual, 37^ inches long. 

2. Sphyy(cna boreaUs. We have examined numerous specimens of 
young Sphyraenas from Wood's Holl, the largest of which do not ex- 
ceed inches in length. We refer them provisionally to aV. horealis. 
These specimens agree quite closely with specimens of Spliyrwna^ from 
the Mediterranean and the Bermudas, in sluipe of body, in position ot 
fins, and in coloration. Others from the Canaries and from Europe be- 
long to a totally different species. There are two European species 
which have been confused by recent writers, and united under the name 
8. vuJ(/arts: We are not at present able to untangle the synonymy. 

3. A species which we provisionally refer to *S'. guaguancho, which in 
the position of the fins resembles S.picnda, though the scales are much 
smaller, 107 to 115 in the lateral line. Besides the Peiisacola specimen 
already mentioned, we have seen this species from Cuba and from 
Wood's IIoll, where a specimen (No. 21,226) nearly 22 inches long was 
obtained by Vinal N. Edwards, in July, 1876. 

68. Sphyreena guaguancho Poey. 

A single specimen, Xo. 21,468, 18 inches long. 

The height of the body is 7 times in the total length without cau- 
dal; length of head 3^ to 3^ times, greatest in young. Diameter of 
eye contained 6 times in adult, 5^ in young ; operculum with two points. 
Length of pectoral equal to the postorbital portion of the head, 8i times 
in total in young, 9 times in adult ; its length greater than that of the 
ventrals, which are contained 3^ in head. Spines of the ventrals almost 
as long as the rays and ^ as long as the head. Origin of dorsal is far in 
front of the middle of the body, and in adults slightly, and in the young 
considerably, in advance of the perpendicular from the tip of the 
pectoral. The 5th dorsal spine is inserted exactly midway between 
the tip of the snout and the base of the middle caudal rays. The ven- 
trals inserted in advance of the dorsal. The interspace between the 
dorsals is contained 5^ to 5| times in the total without caudal. L. lat. 107

Two specimens (Nos. 21,481 a and 21,481 b) were sent from Pensacola 
by Mr. Stearns. We also have numerous specimens, No. 21,870, collected 
in Lake Monroe, Fla., by Prof. Baird. 

Diagnosis. — The origin of the anterior dorsal fin is far in advance of 
the anal fin and slightly in advance of the vent. The height of the body 
is contained 5 times in total length without caudal (6 times in total 
length) ; it is slightly less than the length of the head, and precisely equal 
to the length of the pectoral. The diameter of the eye is contained 3 to 3i 
times in the length of the head; is about equal to the length of the snout 
and to the width of the interorbital space. Mouth very protractile. 
Lower jaw long, contained 11 times in length of body without caudal, 
more than one-third of the length of the head, which is contained 
in total length of body 4 to 4J times. Silvery streak occupying the 
fourth and upper half of the fifth series of scales. Caudal deeply

Diagnosis. — The origin of the anterior dorsal fin is situated i)ehiud a 
point midway between the origins of the ventral and anal fin and oppo- 
site the middle of the interspace between the anal fin and the vent. 
Height of the body contained 5i to 6 times in length without caudal, 
and 6§ in total length, considerably less than length of head and length 
of pectoral. Diameter of the eye contained 3 times in length of head, 
greater than length of snout, and less than width of interorbital space.

81. Pomolobus chrysochloris Eafinesquc. — "Shad." 

One of the most interesting facts brought to notice by this collection 
is the occurrence in the Gulf of Mexico of this species, hitherto thought 
to live only in fresh waters. 

Three individuals, Nos. 21,778, 21,770, 21,780, were received, Decem- 
ber 0, 1878, from the Pensacola Ice Company, the largest 15J inches in 
length. 

82. Harengula pensacolae sp. nov. Goode & Bean. — Aleivife. 

The species is by its form most closely associated with Harengula 
macrophthaJma, while in other respects it resembles Harengula cluj)eola 
and Harengula humeraUs. 

The head is very short, its length contained 4 times in the length 
of the fish without caudal, and nearly 5 times in its extreme length, 
to line drawn between the tips of the caudal lobes. In H. sardina Poey 
{=H macroi)hthaltna Eanz., Jide GUnther), the head is contained 3.J times 
in body-length; in H. clupeola Cuv. & Val. (as identified by Poey), a much 
more elongate species, oh to Sf; in H. callolejm sp. nov., Goode, MS., 
from the Bermudas, 3i to of times. 

The body is high, with projecting belly, the contour resembling that 
of the Common Shad, Alosa sajjidissima, its height at the posterior ex- 
tremity of the operculum being greater than the distance from the tip 
of the lower jaw to the posterior extremity of the operculum : in the 
other species it is less, notably so in H. ealloleim, in which the height at 
this point barely equals the distance from the tip of the lower jaw to 
the posterior edge of the preoperculnm. 

The height of the body is contained in its length (without caudal) 2^ 
to 3 times (in H. sardina 3 times; in H. elupeola 3i times; in H. callole- 
])is 3| to 4 times, being equal to the length of the head). 

Scales of the back in front of dorsal with radiating strijie and sharply 
serrated edges, these features being less prominent in the one or two 
rows on each side next to the dorsal. Other scales smooth, with irregu- 
lar, but unarmed free margins. When detached they show from three 
to seven parallel vertical lines, these lines being most numerous posteri- 
orly ; upon the nuchal scales these are scarcely present, and they are 
not visible when attached to the skin, as they are in H. sardina (in H. 
clupeola the striations of the nuchal scales are very evident, though 
the edges are not armed, and the lateral scales exhibit vertical ridges, 
but in smaller number, ranging from one or more anteriorly to three 
posteriorly; in H. callolcpis the nuchal scales are smooth, unstriated, 
unarmed; the lateral scales from the anterior part of the body are 
marked with lines not even approximately parallel, and neither straight 
nor extending over the whole scale, as in the other : on the scales of 
the posterior part of the body, the markings are very irregular, some- 
tildes showing as many as nine or ten irregular waving, approximately 
parallel, undulating lines, at others with the vertical lines coalescing 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 153 

with irregularly undulating horizontal lines, to form a graceful, irregular 
network). 

Scales arranged in 40 transverse and 11^ longitudinal rows. In H. 
sardina 40 (38-42 according to Giinther); in ^. callolepis 38, as nearly 
as can be ascertained from specimens partly denuded of scales, and 10^ 
longitudinal rows. 

Lower jaw moderately long, its length included nearly 3 times in 
distance from snout to origin of dorsal, and equal to half the distance 
from tip of snout to the posterior margin of the operculum (in H. clu- 
peola and in H. sardina equalling half length of head as measured above, 
in S. callolepis less than half; in H. calloJepis contained about 2§ times 
in distance from tip of snout to posterior margin of operculum, in H. 
sardina 2J^ times, in B. pensacohv nearly 3 times). 

The maxillary extends behind the front margin of the orbit, as in all 
species of the genus which have been examined. 

Teeth very small, inconspicuous in the jaws. A large patch of asper- 
ities on the tongue nearly covering its upper surface (iu 11. callolepis 
this patch is much smaller, lanceolate in form); cheeks and opercula 
veined prominently. Gill-rakers fine, closely set, shorter than the eye, 
about 50 on one side of the first arch (in H. callolepis they are thick, 
stiff', wiry, not closely set, about 40 in number; in R. sardina they are 
much the same as in H. callolepis iu shape and arrangement, and the 
number does not exceed 42 ; in S. clupeola they are somewhat shorter, 
and number at least 50). 

Eye large, its diameter longer than snout, contained about 3 times 
in the length of the head (in H. sardina the length of the snout nearly 
equals the eye, and in if. callolepis this is also the case, the diameter of 
the eye, however, being still about ^ of the length of the head). 

Dorsal fin inserted midway between snout and base of caudal, the 
ventral also originating at a point equidistant from snout and origin of 
upper caudal lobe (in R. cliqieola the ventral is placed midway, while 
the dorsal is very slightly nearer to the snout than to the base of the 
upper caudal lobe; in R. callolepis the ventral is midway, while the 
dorsal is nearer to the base of tlie upper caudal lobe by a distance 
nearly equal to the diameter of the pupil of the eye ; in R. sardina the 
ventral is nearer to the snout, the dorsal nearer to the base of the 
superior caudal ray by a distance nearly equal to the diameter of the 
orbit). 

There are 12 abdominal scutes behind the base of the ventral fin, as 
is the case also with R. callolepis and R. sardina, R. clupeola having 14. 

A high shield of scales enclosing the base of the dorsal and anal 
fins.

A single specimen. No. 22,813 (101), 22 inclies in length. A stont and 
short-headed form, agreeing essentially with A. hostoniensis as defined 
by Giinther, except that the distance between the origin of the dorsal 
and anal fins is considerably greater than the length of the head. The 
thick lips and shape of the body suggest Girard's Anguilla tyranmis 
from the Gulf of Mexico.

This species is probably the Crotalopsis pumtifcr oi'K'A\\\)* and called 
by Giinther Ophichthys imnctifer. We have had no opportunity of exam- 
ining the original description by Kaup, and Dr. Giinther does not claim 
to have seen specimens of this species. We therefore provisionally 
adopt the name of Poey, being fully convinced that the specimen 
described by him is specifically identical with a specimen. No. 17,17G,

The coloration of these specimens is various and in general corre- 
sponds with the description given by Giinther. Agassiz's figure repre- 
sents a fish ornamented with fewer and larger spots than in these 
Florida specimens, which show the spots very closely contiguous, espe- 
cially on the head. Some of these specimens show narrow^ longitudinal 
brown lines upon the throat and posterior part of the head below the 
branchial opening. The markings on the dorsal fin are also somewhat, 
different from any heretofore described. We observe a regularlj" undu- 
lating line of white about as wide as the pupil of the eye, the upper 
undulations extendiug to the edges of the fin ; between these undula- 
tions are sub-triangular spots of blackish browu, which together form an 
interrupted black margin to the fin. These markings, and indeed the 
general appearance of the fish, are perhaps best represented bj' Girard's 
figure, which, however, fails to indicate the white undulating line 
already mentioned. 

The Museum has also a bottle, No. 5,997, containing old and young 
specimens of this species from Cedar Keys, Florida. 

We have examined a specimen, apparently of this species, catalogued 
"No. 7,004, St. Joseph's Island, Texas, Geo. Wiirdemann," which we 
believe to be the original type of Girard's Neonmrwna nigromarginata.

NOTES OTS NEW ENGIiAND ISOPODA. 

By OSCAR KARC^ER. 

The marine Isopoda collected by the United States Commission of 
Fish and Fisheries having been placed in my hands by Professor Yer- 
rill, a report has been prepared including full descriptions, with figures 
of most of the species, except the Bopyridce. Besides the collections 
of the Fish Commission, I haA^e, through the kindness of Professor Yer- 
rill, had access to other extensive collections made principally hj him- 
self and Prof. S. I. Smith, at various points along the coast from Great 
Egg Harbor, Kew Jersey, to the Bay of Fundy, as is more fully detailed 
in the report now ready for publication. On account of unexpected 
delay in the publication of the report, it has been thought best to pre- 
pare the following brief summary of its contents, with especial reference 
to facts not hitherto published. Only such references are here given as 
are necessary to the understanding of the names adopted, and, in gen- 
eral, the distribution on the New England coast only is indicated. 

The Bopyridce have been identified by Professor S. I. Smith, who has 
also rendered other important assistance in the preparation of the re- 
port, of which the present paper may be regarded as an abstract. 

The Oniscidce, not being properlj^ marine, are in general not included 
in the report ; but three species, two of them as yet found only on the 
coast, are included as being commonly found by marine collectors. 
They are the first three of the following list, which embraces also all the 
marine Isopoda known to inhabit the waters of New England : 

Pbiloscia vittata Say, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phil., vol. i, p. 429, 1818.

Common throughout the Kew England coast under sea-weed, in tide

through the kindness of Eev. A. M. Norman, indicates that our species 
must be regarded as identical with the well-known British species, and 
is therefore common to the two coasts. 

Janira alta=:^sf?/o(/('s alta Stimpson, Mar. Invert. Grand Manan, p. 41, pi. iii, fig, 
30, 1853. 

A northern species not as yet found south of Massachusetts Bay, oc- 
casionally collected in tide-pools, but usually dredged, and extending to 
a depth of 190 fathoms. 

This s])ecies is easily distinguished specifically from J. maculosa Leach, 
the type of the genus, but does not appear to differ by characters of 
generic importance, and I have therefore referred it to the older genus. 

Janira spinosa, n. sp. 

A second species of this genus was obtained in the summer of 1878, 
and on examination it appears to be as yet undescribed, although some- 
what resembling J. laciniata G. O. Sars, but distinguished by the double 
instead of single row of spines along the dorsal region of the thorax. 

The head is strongly rostrate, and has the antero-lateral angles acutely 
produced, but shorter than the median rostrum. The eyes are small 
and black, and placed a little behind the middle of the head, at about 
an equal distance from the median line and the lateral margin. The 
anteimuliP are slender, and slightly surpass the first four segments of the 
antenna^. The antenufe are about as long as the head and thorax 
togetlier, and the scale attached to the second peduncular segment is 
slender and pointed, surpassing the third segment. The flagellum forms 
about half the length of the antenna, and is slender, tapering, and multi-" 
articulate. 

The thoracic segments are all acutely produced at the sides into one 
or two salient angles, forming a row of acute serrations along the sides 
of the body. The first segment has a single angle produced somewhat 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 159 

forward around the sides of the head ; the second, third, and fourth 
segments usually present two serrations, both the anterior and posterior 
angles being produced and acute, and the last three segments are pro- 
duced and directed more and more backward. In the dorsal region, 
each segment bears a pair of shaiTp tubercles or spines. Anteriorly these 
spines are near the front margins of the segments and directed forward, 
but become posteriorly more erect and nearer the middle of the segment, 
and the last three pairs are directed backward, the last pair being near the 
hinder margin of the seventh segment. The legs are slightly spiny, the 
first pair but little thickened in the females. The pleon tapers at the 
sides, where it is minntely serrulate. Its posterior angles are salient and 
acute, like the anterior angles of the head. The uropods are of moderate 
length, about as long as the pleon, and composed of a cylindrical basal 
segment, bearing two rami, of which the inner is somewhat the larger, 
and nearly as long as the basal segment. Both, together with the basal 
segment, are sparingly bristly. 

The color in alcohol is nearly white. Length S"""'. 

Two specimens of this species were collected at Banquereau by Cap- 
tain Collins, of the schooner Marion, August 25, 1878. They were found 
adhering to the cable of the schooner.

This species is commoD throughout the coast of New Enghxiul, but is 

more abuudaut southward, being to a great extent rephiced toward the 

north by the next species. 

A comi^arison of English and European specimens with our own 
leaves no doubt of the identity of the species on the opposite coasts of 
the Atlantic. Being a common European species, it has been mentioned 
by many authors under a variety of names, which are more fully quoted 
and discussed in the report. Say's name appears to be the earliest that 
can be certainly connected with the species.

The determination of the synonymy of this species rests i^rincipally

This genus was associated with the Asellidce by Edwards without an 
examination of the specimens, and, so far as I know, he has been followed 
by recent authors. An examination of its structure appears to point 
unmistakably to affinity with the Sphccromidce. I have not, however, 
thought best to include it in that family, but liave placed it in a 
family by itself, the Limnoriida\

This species has been found at Noank Harbor, Conn., and will proba- 
bly be found at other locahties on our coast. I have had no European 
specimens for comparison, and, unfortunately, have not had access to 
some important European literature on the subject, but do not know of 
any character by which to distinguish it from Eathke's species, and have 
therefore regarded it as identical. 

This genus is well separated from the next by the pleon, which bears 
only three pairs of jdeopods and uniramous uropods, and by the remark- 
able incubatory sacs attached to the fifth thoracic segment of the 
females, and unlike anything else found among the Isopoda. They have 
been described by Eathke, Willemoes-Suhm, and others.

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 163 

Eev. A. M. IsTorman, appears to agree perfectly with tlie males of this 
species, though not with Kroyer's description of Tanais EdwardsU. I 
have not therefore united my species with his, though I think it possi- 
ble they may prove identical. 

The species occurs in considerable abundance at Noank Harbor, Conn., 
among algce, and also at Vineyard Sound, and will probably bo found 
at other localities on the southern shore of New England. It has also 
been collected by Professor Verrill, during the present summer, at Pro- 
vincetown, Mass., in company with Limnorla and Chelura, in old piles. 
The genus Leptoclielia has several years' priority over Paratanais, and, 
though founded on the male sex, ought, as I think, to be retained.

Leptochelia rapax, u. s. 

Females of this species considerably resemble those of L. Umicola, 
but nuiy be distinguished by the following characters : The eyes are 
larger and more conspicuous; the last segment of the antennulje is 
scarcely longer than the preceding, instead of nearly twice as long, as in 
X. Umicola; the dactylus of the second pair of legs is somewhat shorter 
and the terminal spine less attenuated, and the external ramus of the 
uropods consists of a single very short and small segment, shorter than 
the basal segment of the inner ramus, which is not elongated. The inner 
ramus is live-jointed, instead of six-jointed, as in L. algicola. 

The males are remarkable for the long and slender prehensile hand 
terminating the first pair of legs. The body of the males is short and 
robust, with the segments well marked by constrictions. The head, 
with the united first thoracic segment, is short and rounded, bulging 
strongly at the sides just behind the eyes, which are conspicuous, some- 
what less in diameter than the bases of the antennulte, distinctly articu- 
lated, and coarsely faceted. The antennuhe are elongated, especially in 
the basal segment, which is more than one-third as long as the body, 
slightly swollen on the inner side, near the base, then tapering to the 
tip; the second segment is cylindrical, less than half as long as 
and more slender than the first ; the third is less than half the 
length of the second, and is followed by about eight short flagellar seg- 
ments, the last one tipped with seta". The antennje, when extended, do 
not attain the end of the basal antennular segment ; the first three seg- 
ments are short, the fourth longest, being longer than the first three 
together, the fifth slender and tipped with sette. The terminal seti^e 
of both antennuLTB and antennne arise in part fi*om minute or rudimen- 
tary terminal segments. The first pair of legs forms the most striking 
feature of this species. These legs, when extended, are in general 
longer than the body of the animal, though they vary considerably 
in size, being usually proportionally smaller in the smaller specimens. 
In these legs, the segments preceding the carpus are short and robust ; 
but the carpus is about half as long as the body, and the i^ropodus 



164 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

is even somewhat longer than the carpus, and usually strongly flexed 
beneath it. More than half the length of the propodus is made up of 
the slender digital process, which bears a low tooth on the inner side, 
near the base, and a stouter one near the slender incurved tip. The 
dactylus is slender, curved, and pointed, and armed with a few weak 
spinules along the inner margin. The forceps thus formed are capable 
of seizing and closing around the body of another individual. 

The thoracic segments, except the first, are well separated ; the second 
(first free) segment is shortest ; the third, fourth, and fifth segments are 
of increasing length ; the sixth is as long as the fifth ; the seventh shorter. 
The first five segments of the pleon are of about equal length ; the sixth 
shorter and obtusely pomted in the middle. The uropods consist on 
each side of a robust basal segment, bearing two rami, the outer short, 
and composed of a single segment, the inner five-jointed and tapering. 
Both rami are sparingly bristly. The males vary in length from 2.G™°» 
to 3.8"^", and in breadth from O.G""" to CS™"". The females are more 
slender. Color in alcohol nearly white or marked in the males by a 
brownish transverse band along the posterior margin of each segment. 

This species was collected by Professor Hyatt and Messrs. Van ^^eck 
and Gardner at Annisquam, Mass., in the summer of 1878.

By A. E. VERRILI.. 

Among the very extensive collections made during the past eight 
years by the U. S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries, under the direc- 
tion of Professor Baird, there are still many species not recorded as 
American in any of the re]wrts hitherto published ; most of these are 
well-known Arctic or Northern European species, but others are still 
undescribed. As the final reports on the different groups will require a 
long time for their completion, owing to the vast number of specimens 
to be examined from more than a thousand localities, it has been thought 
desh^able to record some of the more important additions to the fauna, 
without further delay.* More detailed descriptions and numerous fig- 
ures will be published in the final reports, together with the details of 
their geographical distribution. All the species included in the follow- 
ing list, unless otherwise stated, have been collected by the U. S. Fish 
Commission. 

■"Many species have also been recorded in various articles in the American Journal 
of Science and Arts, during several years past. See, also, an important paper on the 
Podophthalmous Crustacea, by Professor S. I. Smith, and one on the Pycnogonida, by 
E. B. Wilson, in the Trans. Conn. Academy, vol. v, 1879,

ANNELIDA. 

Sthenelais gracilis, sp. nov. 

A small, sleuder, delicate species. Scales white, smooth, outer edge 
vrith few (12-lG) very small, unequal, tapering papillte, which are not 
crowded, the longest about as long as the intervening spaces. Head 
short, broad, the posterior and lateral margins rounded, the front emar- 
ginate. Eyes black, conspicuous ; the posterior pair on the dorsal sur- 
face in advance of the middle of the head ; anterior pair nearer together, 
close to the anterior margin ; median antenna long, stout at base, tapering 
to a slender tip ; the palpi have about the same form and length as the 
median antenna. Dorsal sette longer than the ventral, extremely slender, 
tapering gradually toward the very tine tips, and very minutely serrulate. 
Upper ventral setra (2-4) simple, very slender, with the shaft smooth, the 
serrate portion broader, with rather long ascending spinules, the tips 
tapering to a long fine i)oint ; the median sette, above the acicula, have 
longer, much stouter, smooth shafts, expanded distally, with the terminal 
portion long, curved, divided into eight to twelve imperfect joints, taper- 
ing to very slender capillary tips, which are mostly acute, sometimes 
faintly hooked. Below the acicula there are others, similar in structure, 
but with the shaft not so stout, and with the terminal piece shorter, with 
fewer joints ; the lower portion of the liiscicle consists of numerous, 
much more slender, capillary seta3, with smooth shafts and very long, 
slender, tapering, terminal pieces, composed of ten to twelve or more 
imperfect joints. 

Harbor of Gloucester, Mass., 7 to 10 fathoms, sand, 1879 (U. S. Fish 
Commission). Described from alcoholic specimens. 

Sthenelais Emertoni, sp. uov. 

A small, slender species, with white, translucent scales, their outer 
edge with very small, nearly equal, slender papilhie, often slightly 
clavate at tip, and rather near together, their interspaces being mostly 
less than their length ; surface partially covered with minute rounded 
verrucae. 

Dorsal setse very slender, capillary, very minutely transversely serru- 
late. Few (about 4) upper ventral setae, simple, long, slender, with the 
terminal portion sharply serrulate, the tips fine and sharp; next to 
these are some slender compound setoB, the terminal piece slender, 
straight, of moderate length, acute, with six to eight imperfect joints ; 
the median setce have much stouter, smooth shafts, expanded distally, 
and a nearly straight, short, rapidly tapering, sharply pointed, terminal 
piece, of four to six joints ; below these are some with similar though 
smaller shafts, and a short, stout, terminal piece, hooked at the tip, and 
with a sharp ascending spine at about the distal third ; others of the 
same size have the terminal piece very acute, with six to eight or 
more joints 5 the lowest are very slender, with a longer, very fine, taper- 
ing, terminal piece, imperfectly divided into about four to six joints, at 
each of which there is a projecting acute augle like a tooth; the last of

these is not far from tlie minute curved tip, so that the t-ip often appears 
as if bifid. In this character it approaches the genus Eustlxendais of 
M'Intosh, the validity of which may be doubtful. 

Salem Ilarbor, Mass., on muddy bottoms (J. H. Emerton, 1879). 
Described from alcoholic specimens. 

Sthenelais picta Verrill. 

In this species, the scales are partially covered with very small, round, 
slightly prominent, obtuse verrucje, and the free margin bears a row of 
small, simple, rather slender, taperiag or fusiform, mostly acute papillce, 
which are of unequal lengths, and placed at irregular distances, but 
sometimes in small clusters. The seta3 of the dorsal ramus are numer- 
ous, long and slender, but varying in size and length, the median and 
lower ones being much the stoutest and rather strongly serrulate. In 
the superior group of the lower ramus are several ^ery acute setse, 
strongly spirally spiuulate toward the end; next to these are two or 
three, or more, slightly longer, compound sette, with slender shafts, serru- 
late near the joint, and bearing a long, slender, terminal piece, imper- 
fectly jointed in the middle and slightly bifid at tip ; below these are 
numerous, stout, compound setae, mostly shorter, with stouter, smooth 
shafts, enlarged distally, and bearing a short, thick, terminal piece, 
which is decidedly hooked and bifid at the tip ; some of the upper ones 
in this group have the terminal piece more than twice longer than 
broad, but most of them have it triangular and little longer than 
broad; the next series of setai are slender, some with smooth shafts and 
a slender, tapering, terminal portion, composed of two or three indistinct 
joints, and bifid at tip; others, among the most inferior setue, have a 
slender shaft, serrulate distally, witli a simple, slender, terminal piece, 
bifid at tip, or more properly with a slender spine-like process arising 
near to, and nearly as long as the sharp, incurved tip, which is opjiosed 
to it. Grows to the length of G to 8 inches or more.

Sigalion arenicola, sp. nov. 

An elongated, moderately stout, depressed species, narrowed and 
tapered posteriorly, and bearing very numerous, large, thin, white, trans- 
lucent, smooth scales, which have large pinnate processes on their pos- 
terior edge. 

Head small, shield-shaped, widest anteriorly, with a broad, slightly 
rounded lobe in front, and with the anterior angles rounded; ocelli small, 
but distinct, forming a quadrangle on the top of the head, the two pairs 
near together. A pair of minute, obtuse antennae at the front, edge; no 
trace of a median antenna. Scales, except the smaller, rounded, anterior 
ones, large and somewhat quadrangular, with three of the angles; 
rounded; on the posterior border there are about eight to ten well- 
separated, large, deeply pinnate processes, borne on simple, slender

stems; the pinnate portion is broad-ovate, longer than the stems, ^th 
about four to six long, slender pinnie on each side. The setre are very 
numerous and comjilitjated. Those of the dorsal fascicle are long, slen- 
der, capillary, mostly curved inward over the back. In the lower fas- 
cicles there are several kinds: the upper (a) are two to four simple 
ones, with long, tapering, strongly spinulated, very acute tips; the next 
{b) are several compound sette, with the shaft stouter and strongly ser- 
rulated near the end, while the terminal piece, of variable length, is 
composed of many joints, and is minutely bifid at the tip ; the next (e) 
are about six to eight stout, compound setie, arising both above and 
below the supporting acicula?,, and having their shafts minutely and 
closely circularly serrulate toward the end, and with a short, stout, 
tapering, undi\ided, terminal piece, which has a hooked, claw-like tip, 
with a sharp secondary process opposed to it; below these are {d) 
numerous long, slender, compound setae, with shafts scarcely or not at 
all serrulate, and with the subdivided terminal piece minutely bifid at the 
tip, varying in length and number of joints, the middle ones being com- 
paratively stout, Avith the terminal piece tapering and not very slender, 
while the lower ones are very slender and capillary, with a very long, 
tapering, terminal piece, of many joints. Color nearly white or pale 
flesh-color. Length of largest, SO-^" to 100--.

This elegant species is allied to S. BusJdi M'Intosh, and has similar 
appendages to the scales. In our species, however, the pinnate pro- 
cesses are less crowded and have longer stems and fewer and longer 
pinnte. 

Laetmatonice armata, sp. nov. 

Lu'tmatonice Jiliconiis Verrill, formerly, in Ainer. Jonr. Science (non Kiuberg). 
Body stout, depressed, broadest in the middle, tapered shghtly toward 
both ends, the posterior most obtuse. Back covered with large, thin, 
white, smooth scales, usually more or less concealed by a felt-like coat- 
ing, to which mud and dirt adhere. Lower surface granulous. Head 
small, but prominent, with two mhiute, rounded, tubercle-Uke antennoe in 
front and a median antenna arising between them, which has a stout, 
tapering base, but becomes very slender for most of its length; it is 
much shorter than in L. fiUcornis, its tip not reaching to the basal third 
of the palpi. The latter are large and long, regularly tapered to the 
end, three to four times as long as the median antenna and four or five 
times as thick. The first parapodia bear two slender cirri on the upper 
ramus, which are about as large as the median antenna. The scales are 
large, smooth, and translucent, without appendages, mostly broadly 
rounded on the inner and posterior edges, and deeply emarginate on 
the outer attached border. The upper rami of the parapodia bear, besides

several divergent clusters of capillary setee, a group, sometimes of six to 
eight, long, stout, spine-like, dark brown, acute and barbed setoe, liaving 
several short reciu'ved hooks on each edge of the flattened tips, near the 
end. The ventral rami of the parapodia are prominent and bear three, or 
more, stout, elongated, brown set^ne, with sharp, somewhat recurved tips, 
which are covered along the convex side with slender, sharp spinules; 
at the end of the straight shaft, and separated by a naked space from 
the spinulated portion, there is a strong, sharp, divergent spine. Length

Common on muddy bottoms in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine, 
in 50 to 150 ftithoms. Collected first in 18G4, 1865, and 1868, by the 
writer and Professor S. I. Smith, and subsequently by the U. S. Fish 
Commission, in many localities. 

It differs from L. Jilicornis, with which it was formerly identified by 
me, not only in having a much smaller median antenna, but also in the 
character of the setce, especially those of the ventral fascicle. Whether 
the Gulf of St. Lawrence specimens, recorded by M'Intosh as L. fiU- 
cornis, belong to this species, is uncertain. 

Hunoa spinulosa, sp. nov. 

Body large, oblong, rather narrow, of nearly equal breadth through 
the greater j)art of its length. Head dark, deeply bilobed in front, the 
sides rounded ; each lobe terminates in an anterior, acute, white point. 
Eyes large, lateral, the anterior farther apart than the posterior. Median 
antenna rather small, about twice as long as the head, tapering to a 
slender point; lateral antenna smaller and about half as long as median; 
palpi moderate, smooth, much stouter and longer than the antennae; 
tentacular and dorsal cirri long, slender, covered with numerous slender 
papilla?. Scales large, broad, rounded-oblong, the posterior part being 
produced and broadly rounded, the surface covered with minute, rounded 
grains and toward the border with very small, elongated, tapering, acute 
spinules ; outer edge fringed mth numerous small, slender papillae. 
Setai yellow, very abundant, forming large, dense tufts. Those of the 
Tipper parapodia are in part as long as those of the lower, and much 
stouter; the upper ones are shortest, unequal, stout, curved, spine-like, 
acute, finely and closely transversely serrulate throughout most of their 
length, only a very small tip being smooth ; below these there is a group 
of longer and smoother spine-like setje, the serrulation less distinct and 
not extending so far toward the base nor so near to the tip. The ventral 
parapodia have very numerous setje, less than half as thick as the upper 
ones, but the longest about equal to or somewhat exceeding those of the 
upper fascicle ; they are all of one general form, decreasing much in 
length toward the lower side; the shaft is long and smooth, the distal 
portion enlarged, somewhat curved, closely spinulated, ending in a short, 
smooth, shghtly incurved, acute tip. Length (a few posterior segments

Autclytus omatus, sp. no v. 

A small, slender species. The female form is easily distingiiishedby 
the bright red color of the ova and embryos, sho^^ing conspicuously 
through the pale yeUo^vish integuments of the body, or incubatory sac. 
The head is short, broad, shghtly emarginate in fi'ont ; eyes conspicuous, 
lateral, rounded; antennae nearly equal, the median one a little the lon- 
gest ; lateral ones about twice the length of the head. Dorsal cirri long, 
slender, about etiual to the diameter of the body. The three anterior 
segments bear only short seta?, but fascicles of long seta? comm«^nce on 
the fomth ; these are nearly as long as the breadth of the body. Length, 
about 5°^.

Another form, possibly the male of this species, was taken July 21. 
This was bright gTcen in color. The lateral anteunie were of moderate 
length, tapered, swollen at base ; odd median antenna and upper tenta- 
cular cirri slender, very long, about equal to half the body. Dorsal cini 
long, more than half the diameter of the body. Fascicles of long setue 
commence on the fourth segment. 

Odontosyllis lucifera Yerrill. 

£usyUi8 lucifera Yerrill, Amer. Jour. Science, vol. s, p. 39, 1875. 

An examination of the armature of the oesophagus of this species 
shows that it belongs to the genus Odontosyllis. The chitinous rim is 
somewhat horseshoe-shaped, the exti-emities often angular or tooth- 
like, turning inward and downward, while the opposite side bears a row 
of about six small, sharp, inciu-ved denticles. Anal cirri two, rather 
long and slender, transversely liued. 

Pedophylax longiceps, sp. nov. 

A very slender species, allied to P. disjyar Webster, but with much 
longer head and palpi, and longer and stouter caudal cin-i. The head 
is nearly as long as broad, both the front and posterior edge a httle 
produced in the middle ; median antenna arising in advance of the cen- 
ter of the head, swoUen toward the. end, but with the tip acute, some- 
what longer than the head, but scarcely reaching beyond the middle 
of the palpi; lateral antennse very small, papiUiform, nearly in line 
with the odd one. OcelU four, the two pairs close together on the 
head, the anterior just outside of the lateral antennse, the others just 
behind them. Palpi very long, more than twice as long as the head, at 
the base as broad as the head, slightly swoUen, tapering gradually to 
the narrow end, the sides nearly straight or slightly incurved, shghtly

emarginate at the tip, with a distinct sutural line along the middle above. 
Tentacular cirri small, impilliform. Parapodia small, each with a small 
dorsal and ventral cirrus and a large, obtuse, setigerous lobe. Setos of 
several kinds, the usual arrangement being as follows : one or two aci- 
cula shorter than the other sette, tapering, straight, spine-lili;e, one usu- 
ally acute and the other blunt at tip ; one longer, slender, simple seta, 
cui'ved and slightly enlarged toward the end, which suddenly narrows 
to a small acute tip ; one, or sometimes two, of similar size and length, 
straight and abruptly expanded or spatulate near the end of the shaft, 
and bearing a long, very slender, acute, terminal piece ; two or three 
unequal compound setse, with the shaft spatulate at the end and bearing a 
short, acute-triangular, terminal piece. Posteriorly the lowest is a sim- 
ple, curved seta, with a short, sharp tip, similar to the upper one, but 
shorter, more tapered, and less curved. The pharynx occupies about four 
segments ; the median tooth is rather large. Stomach large, occupying 
two segments, oblong, with many circles of granules. Caudal cirri re- 
latively large, elongated, enlarged in the middle, tapering to acute tips, 
their length greater than the diameter of the body, much longer than the 
median antenna. Color, pale salmon. Length, 5""" to 7"™.

Diopatra, October, 1873, and October 15, 1875 (A. E. Verrill). 

A specimen, probably a sexual form of this species or P. dispar^ was 
taken in Vineyard Sound, at surface, July 10, 1875. It was similar an- 
teriorly, but on the segments behind the 11th there were fascicles of 
long, slender setae, twice as long as the diameter of the body. Color, yel- 
lowish green. 

Nereis alacris, sp. no v. 

Body rather slender, slightly enlarged behind the buccal segment. 
Autennse slender and pointed. First pair of superior tentacular cirri 
very long and slender, about equal to the first six segments ; those of the 
second pair more than one-third longer, reaching about to the tenth seg- 
ment ; ventral cirri also long and slender, about one-third as long as the 
corresponding superior ones. Caudal cirri remarkably long and slender, 
longer and more slender than the longest tentacular cirri. General color 
of head and anterior segments bright olive-green ; posterior segments 
and appendages tinged with orange-red; bases of antennae and cirri 
tinged with pm^^lish red ; anterior eyes dark green with a red center, 
posterior pale red with a dark red center; middle of head pale green ; a 
row of more or less connected and sometimes confluent light spots 
extends along the back, one to each segment ; these spots are usually 
greenish white anteriorly, yellowish posteriorly. Smaller specimens are 
plainer colored, mostly greenish or brownish, often without dorsal spots.

length, the superior one somewhat gibbons and bearing the long, slen- 
der, dorsal cii-rus beyond its middle; beyond the origin of the latter the 
lingula is lanceolate, subacute at the end ; three conspicuous dark spots 
on the superior lingula, one terminal, one at the origin of the cirrus, the 
other midway between that and the body ; another spot on the body, at 
base of the appendage. The inferior lingula is also lanceolate, a little 
shorter than the superior. More than half the length of the dorsal cir- 
rus projects beyond the end of the lingula. The ventral lingula of the 
lower ramus is oblong-lanceolate, obtuse, considerably smaller than 
the dorsal one. Ventral cirrus small, slender, acute, not reaching to 
the end of the ventral lingula. SetsB in both the upper and lower rami 
of two kinds: in the superior fascicle of each they have slender, 
acute, terminal pieces ; in the inferior fascicle the terminal piece is short 
and hooked at the tip. It is very active in all its motions, and swims 
rapidly. It constructs a tenacious tube, attached to algre, and sup- 
ported by divergent silken threads. Length, 2 to 3 inches.

Xcctonereis megalops Verrill, Eeport on Invert, of Vineyard Sd., etc., i). 293, 
[592], pi. xii, figs. 62, 63, 1873. 

The female of this form was taken in Vineyard Sound, at surface, in 
1875. Although agreeing in general with the male, it departs less widely 
from the ordinary Heteronereis form, both in respect to its head, palpi, 
and the dorsal parapodial appendages. The male has a simple, median, 
tapering, caudal cirrus. There are two minute, dark spots on each seg- 
ment, along the middle of the ventral surface, posteriorly. 

It is so nearly related to the Heteronereis stage of Nereis BumeriU, and 
to the Heteronereis 2Ialmgreni described by Claparede, and to other 
related forms discovered on our coast by Professor Webster, that it 
seems probable that its Nereis stage, when known, will be closely aUied 
to N. BumeriU, and consequently should be referred to Nereis, or to 
Leontis, if the latter be regarded as a distinct genus. 

Ceratocephale Websteri, sp. nov. 

Head small, with the cephalic lobe emarginate in front, and with a 
median groove running back; sides slightly incurved; posterior margin 
slightly convex. No eyes. Antennae small, slender, tapering, coales- 
cent at base with the palpi. Pali^i small, slender, bent somewhat down- 
ward, not much larger than the antennte, the terminal joint small, sub- 
acute, about one-third the whole length. The four cephalic organs are 
similar in form, and all are directed forward. Tentacular cirri slender, 
acute ; the dorsal ones of the two anterior pairs are longer than the 
others, being nearly twice as long as the diameter of the body ; the ven- 
tral ones are bent downward and forward in life, and are less than half 
as long ; of the two posterior pairs, the dorsal are somewhat longer than 
the ventral. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 173 

Buccal segment large, somewbat swollen. Jaws small, light brown, 
strongly curved, with slender, sharp tips, the edge moderately serrulate. 
Denticles (or paragnaths) not observed, the proboscis being retracted. 
Parapodia of anterior segments small, the two rami of nearly equal 
length, and with similar fascicles of setai, the lower ones most numerous, 
the upper hngula small, subtriangular, terminated by the slender, taper- 
ing, dorsal cirrus, which, at about the fifth segment, is more than twice 
as long as the lingula and reaches about to the end of the setse. Ventral 
cirrus short, tapering. Farther back, at the eleventh segment and beyond, 
the rami become more unequal, the ui)per lingula develops into a long, 
flat, narrow, tapering branchia, bearing the filiform dorsal cii*rus at its tip. 
At the fifteenth segment and beyond the branchia is decidedly longer 
than the parapodia, curved directly upward, and about eight times as 
long as its width in the middle, and more than half the diameter of the 
body, rather abuptly narrowed at tne tip, and terminated by the long, 
slender cirrus, which equals or exceeds the branchia. In the enlarged 
base of the branchice there is a circular, thickened, white, round spot, 
due to an internal organ. On the setigerous lobe of the upper ramus 
is a narrow-lanceolate, lingula-like process, extending from the setiger- 
ous lobe as far as the tips of the setae. On the lower ramus there are two 
similar lin guise, one of which is terminal, and the other is situated at 
about the distal third, on the lower side. Ventral cirrus small, slender, 
tapered, single on the first sixteen segments ; on the seventeenth and 
subsequent segments there are two equal ventral cirri, arising close to- 
gether. Setse in this region form a large fascicle in each ramus, with a single 
aciculum dividing each fascicle into two groups. The setie in the upper 
ramus have a very long, slender, smooth, nearly straight, terminal joint, 
flexible at tip, and not distinctly flattened, even toward the base. In 
the lower ramus, the terminal joint is not quite so long, slender, and nar- 
row, but distinctly flattened, and with the edge very finely serrulate ; 
these are very slightly curved, but not abruptly bent, near the base. 
Diameter of the anterior part of the body, G™'" to 7""". Color of body pale 
brownish or pinkish; branchia and bases of parapodia bright red; seti- 
gerous lobes greenish, the setae dark at base. Described from life. 
Dedicated to Professor H. E. Webster, who has largely contributed to 
the knowledge of American Annelids. 

Twenty-four miles east of Cape Cod, 122 fathoms, soft mud (U. S. 
Fish Commission). Only one specimen, which lacks the posterior por- 
tion of the body. Closely related to C. Loveni Malmgren, but the 
latter has the branchial organs cirriform and slender, and the double 
ventral cirri are figured upon the tenth segment; the setae of the 
lower ramus are also represented with the terminal joint abruptly bent 
at base, wider, and much more strongly serrulate than in our specimen. 
It is possible, however, that the two may be only sexual forms of one 
species.

Polydora gracilis, sp. nov. 

Small, 3""" to 4™™ long, very slender. Antennns stout, blunt, very 
long, six times as long as breadth of body, or even more, transversely 
wrinkled. 

Head with a long, narrow, oblong, central i:>ortion, acute behind, 
notched or bilobed in front, with the two anterior corners rounded and 
a little prominent ; side lobes of the head not broad, gradually narrowed 
toward the front ; eyes four, the front pair conspicuous, decidedly larger 
and but little wider apart than the others, which are small and but lit- 
tle farther back. 

The four anterior segments have small, rounded, dorsal papillte, with 
capillary setae ; on the fifth there are fascicles of about six large special 
setse, of which the posterior are shorter. On the sixth and following 
segments, there are, with the capillary sette, three or four uncini in the 
dorsal fascicles. Branchice elongated, commencing on the seventh seg-

Polydora concharum, sp. nov. 

A very long, slender species, having more than 200 segments, and 
often becoming four or five inches long. 

Head, or cephalic lobe, narrow in front, projecting considerably be- 
yond the wide lateral lobes (formed by the buccal segment), and deeply 
divided at the end into two lanceolate, acute, divergent lobes. Eyes 
four, small, but conspicuous, black, the anterior ones much wider apart 
than the posterior, and but little farther forward. In some specimens, 
the eyes are absent. Antennte very long and slender, fifteen to twenty 
times as long as the diameter of the body, or more, whitish or pale flesh- 
color, with a central red vessel, and usually with a fine dark line on each 
side. Buccal segment large and swollen below, witli longitudinal sulci 
extending back from tlie mouth. On the four anterior segments, the

parapodia, above and below, bear slender, very acute, bent setae, and a 
prominent, flat process, somewhat expanded and rounded at the end; 
on the first segment, these are smaller and less spatulate, and the sette 
are fewer and shorter. The fifth segment is about as long as the three 
preceding ones, not much swollen, and it bears three distinct groups of 
setsB, differing in form ; the upper and most anterior are fine, bent, capil- 
lary setae, with acute tips, similar to, but much smaller than, those of the 
preceding segments; below these there is a group of small, slender setse, 
abruptly bent backward and with blunt tips; then there is a row of 
five or six large, strong, dark-colored, nearly straight, blunt spines, 
which are nearly equal in diameter, the anterior and upper ones longer, 
and, when projected at right angles to the body, forming an oblique, 
somewhat curved, transverse row; finally, in a row below the last of 
these, are two or three lighter-colored and more slender, straight spines, 
with abruptly tapered, acute tips. On the succeeding segments, the 
lower fascicles consist of strong, elongated uncini, in rows of six or 
seven, with the tip bidentate, strongly curved, beak-like, and with a thin, 
spatulate border; near the posterior end, they are replaced by acute 
setiB and fine capillary ones. The upper fascicles, on the segments be- 
hind the fifth, consist of numerous, long, bent, very acute setre, like 
those of the anterior segments, the upper one in each fascicle with longer 
and more slender tips than the lower ; toward the posterior end they 
become longer and fewer, with straighter tii)S, equalling or exceeding 
the diameter of the segments. Branchiae appear in a rudimentary form 
as small papillae on the sixth segment; on the seventh they are short 
conical papillae ; on the eighth they become longer and more distinctly 
ligulate, and increase in length on the following segments, soon becom- 
ing long and slender, recurved, and meeting across the back. They 
exist on one hundred or more of the succeeding segments. After the 
branchiae cease the succeeding segments are very numerous, smaller, 
and rounder, so that the body is more slender and attenuated poste- 
riorly, and somewhat broader and a little flattened on the branchiferous 
portion. Anal segment small, terminating in four small, roundish, 
equal, flattened lobes. 

Color somewhat variable, usually pale flesh-color, or grayish or yel- 
lowish white anteriorly, and more or less tinged with dull greenish or 
brownish posteriorly, the red dorsal vessel showing plainly, and the 
branchiae red. Length, 100™™ to 140™™; breadth, 1™™ to 1.5™™; length of

176 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

A new genus, related to Sino, but with a i)air of brancliial append- 
ages behind tbe long antennae, and with a distinct collar on the front 
edge of the second setigerous segment, wasjdiscovered near New Haven, 
Conn., at low- water, in 1877, and had been briefly described in this arti- 
cle. But learning that Professor H. E. Webster had also discovered the 
same genus, and had described it in a forthcoming paper on the Anne- 
lids of Kew Jersey, with an abundance of good specimens, my descrip- 
tion has been withdrawn. 

Spio limicola, sp. nov. 

A small, slender species, with branchiae on all the segments, and usu- 
ally characterized by blackish, transverse lines and spots on the head 
and anterior segments. Body thickest anteriorly, tapering gradually 
to the end, somewhat depressed. Head flattened, obtusely rounded in 
front. Eyes four, small, nearly in a square. The anterior a little wider 
apart. Autennoe rather stout at base, tapered, blunt, about four or five 
times as long as breadth of body, whitish, with red vessels, and some- 
times with thin, dark lines along the edges. Branchiaj flat, shorter, 
broader, and blunt anteriorly; narrower, longer, and more tapering far- 
ther back, where they meet across the back; posteriorly they become 
small and i;)apilliform. The parapodia have anteriorly, in the upi)er 
ramus, two broad lingulne, of which the posterior is the longer and more 
acute; the cai^illary setie, arising between them, form large fascicles 
anteriorly; posteriorly they become longer, exceeding the diameter of 
the body, and form small fascicles. In the posterior region, the upper 
liugulfe become more unequal, the posterior one becoming elongated and 
the anterior one reduced to a mere pai)illa. The lower ramus is nearly 
the same on all the segments, consisting of a broadly rounded, flat, thick 
lobe, bearing a group of numerous uncini. Anal segment small, bear- 
ing four moderately long, blunt cirri, their length about twice the diam- 
eter of the anal segment. 

Color, iiale reddish white or light flesh-color, with bright red vessels 
and branchiae, and showing the greenish intestine posteriorly; head 
with two blackish spots in front and others on the sides and beneath j 
anterior segments with blackish, transverse spots or interrupted lines 
of blackish between the segments on the ventral side and laterally; liran- 
chi;Te and botli upper and lower lingulte usually with flake-white specks 
or a white line along their margins; anal segment and cirri greenish 
yellow.

depressed, narrow in middle, expanding laterally at the front, witli prom- 
inent, blunt, lateral angles, and with a broadly rounded or sometimes 
slightly emarginate front margin ; posteriorly the narrow head-lobe ex- 
tends back to the second setigerous segment. Eyes four, minute, in a 
quadrangle, the anterior pair wider apart. Antenna? slender, not very 
long, about three times as long as diameter of body. Buccal segment 
swollen, forming short, convex, lateral lobes along the posterior half of 
the head ; lielow the mouth is a prominent, strongly ciliated lobe. Bran- 
chiae in four pairs, on the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th setigerous segments; the 
anterior pair branched, the others apparently foliaceous and shorter.* 
The first setigerous segment has a small, prominent, rounded, upper 
ramus, with few short seta?. The 2d to 5th have a broad linguliform, or 
leaf-like, upper ramus, with the inner distal edge prolonged into an angle 
over the back, and a very broad, fan -shaped fascicle of long acute setse 
set transversely and protecting the gills ; a smaller lobe also exists in 
front of the setae ; lower ramus composed of a small, rounded lobe with 
a fascicle of slender sette, and with nncini in the fascicles beyond the 
15th segment, and a cluster of acute settr. The parapodia increase rap- 
idly in size from the 1st to the 0th, and then graduaWy decrease to the 
17th segment, beyond which they are rudimentary ; on the 5th to Sth the 
upper lingula is about half as long as the breadth of the body ; beyond the 
5th they are more or less expanded distally, or wide, spatulate, bluntly 
terminated ; beyond the 10th small, not very prominent, rounded ; on 5th 
to 10th segments the upper seta? are slender, acute, longer than the lin- 
gula, and in large fascicles, though in much smaller ones t2ian those of 
the branchiferous segments ; on the posterior segments the uncini become 
longer, and the capillary setne mostly disappear in the lower fascicles. 
Color yellowish or greenish white, often decidedly greenish posteriorly, 
and with a dark greenish -yellow intestine. Some were filled with pale 
pink eggs, August 29.

clavate, inieqnal, branchial cirri, mostly less than four times as long as 
the diameter of the body. The two anterior segments have slender ca- 
pillary seta) in the upper fascicles, less long than the diameter of the body; 
they increase in length and numbers farther back, and on the seventh 
and forty to fifty succeeding segments they become very numerous and 
remarkably long, being from two to three times as long as the breadth of 
the body ; toward the posterior end of the body they again diminish in 
length, becoming comparatively short on the last twenty segments. The 
ventral set» are all capillary and fine-pointed on the anterior and median 
segments ; they somewhat exceed the diameter of the hody in the middle 
segments, but are shorter toward both ends. On the last twenty seg- 
ments there are, in each ventral tiiscicle, one or two short unciuiform 
sette with somewhat hooked but scarcely bidentate tips. Similar unciui- 
form setoe exist in some of the posterior dorsal fascicles. The setse are 
silvery white. Body dark olive-green, with lighter dorsal line ; branchiae 
with dark tips. Length, about 25"^'" 5 diameter, without appendages, l"""^

Dodecaceria coucharum Oersted. 

This species is nearly allied to the last, and occurred with it. It is 
very common, on our coast, in various shells. The genus Dodecaceria 
CErsted has not been distinctly distinguished from Heferocirrm Grube, 
to which it is closely related. The number of branchial cirri is variable 
in both, but their arrangement is the same. The seta), however, are 
different in their arrangement. In D. concliarum the 1st segment bears 
no seta) ; on the 2d to 7th there are short capillary setffi, above and 
below ; on the 8th there is a solitary, long, unciniform seta in the dorsal 
fascicle of capillary setoe, and four or five stouter ones, with bidentate 
tips in the ventral fascicles, and no capillary ones ; on the Otli and suc- 
ceedimg segments, the ventral seta) continue as on the 8th, and the 
dorsal fascicles usually contain four or five elongated, simple, hooked 
uncini, together with more or less numerous fine, acute, cajnllary set*, 
which are often absent, but they occur on some of the segments even to 
the posterior end, where they are often about one-third as long as the 
diameter of the body. Behind the middle of the body the uncini become 
smaller, shorter, and fewer, only two or three to a tascicle, but near the 
posterior end, on four or five segments, they become stouter, more hooked, 
and distinctly bidentate, especially on the ventral side. 

The color is usually dark green or greenish black, and no distinct 
ocelli were detected, but some obscure dark specks may represent them. 

Praxillura, geu. iiov. 

Body very long and composed of a larger number of segments than is 
usual in the MaldankJcv. Posterior segments very numerous, short, be-

ments numerous and short, eight or more (in the type), bearing, in the 
lower rami, one or Wo simj^le, acute sj)ines; in the middle and posterior 
regions bearing a row of uncini. Head gibbous posteriorly, without 
any well-marked lateral fold. 

Praxillura ornata, sp. uov. 

Body very long, slender, of nearly uniform diameter, composed of about 
forty setigerous segments; the eight anterior bear only one or two spines 
in the ventral rami, uncini appearing on the 9th. Head swollen and 
gibbous above, posteriorly, abruptly flattened in front, with the anterior 
edge bluntly rounded ; two rounded, lateral lobes beneath; front con- 
cave beneath; no distinct lateral lobes above; numerous small, red ocelli 
in several rows around the front margin. Buccal segment thick, coales- 
cent with the head, long, bianinilate, the head and buccal segment together 
about equal in length to the first two setigerous ones. The eight ante- 
rior, setigerous segments are short, scarcely longer than broad, with a 
well-marked suture between, and biannulate, the posterior half smaller, 
the anterior swollen in the middle, where the setai arise, and with a red 
band behind the setie. In the middle region, the segments are long and 
narrow. The seven or eight anterior segments have a small ui^per fas- 
cicle of slender acute setie, and one stout acute spine below (sometimes 
two). On the ninth segment * there are two uncini and a spine below 
them ; and on the tenth to the twelfth and several following there are 
four to eight uncini, and the number increases farther back. The last 
seventeen setigerous segments are very short. These are followed by 
several scarcely distinct segments at the posterior end, which is tapered 
and simple. Color pinkish white, with a bright red band ou each seg- 
ment anteriorly, a dark red spot on each side of the head, and two bands 
of red on the buccal segment. Ocelli red. On the middle region, the 
bands are less distinct, and the surface is covered with dark brown 
specks. Length, 125™"^ to 150'""\ Diameter, 1"^"" to LS-"™. Described

setJB above, and a row of about three spines below ; on tbe fourtb and 
fiftb seg^ments there are six to nine uncini in the row, and more far- 
ther back, where they become prominent, strongly hooked, or claw-like 
uncini. The fourth and several succeeding segments are usually more 
than twice as long as broad, with an annulation in front of the middle; 
farther back, in the middle region, the segments are six to eight times 
as long as broad, very slender, swollen near the posterior end, where 
the sette arise. The last three setigerous segments are about as long as 
broad, swollen in the middle, and bear slender setse about one-half as 
long as the breadth of the body, and a row of uncini. Anal segment 
consolidated with the preceding, apparently single, uon-setigerous one, 
very obliquely truncated at the end, and surrounded by a well-developed, 
smooth border, interrupted dorsally, so that when expanded it has a 
spatulate form. The anal opening appears to be nearly central, within 
the border. The caudal membrane is filled with blood-vessels. In the 
middle region of the body, on the ninth to eighteenth segments, in the 
upper fascicles of acute setse, are two very long, slender, flexible, thread- 
like seta}, usually unequal, the longer six to eight times as long as the 
diameter of the segments; they are covered with sharp spinules, alter- 
nating on the two sides. Color of middle segments salmon, thickly 
specked with orange-brown and reticulated with red blood-vessels;

cicles. The uncini are numerous on the following segments, and are 
long aud somewhat bent, but show no constriction, the distal portion 
being regularly narrow, spatulate, or paddle-shaped, with the central 
shaft curved, blunt, and slightly hooked at the tip. In some specimens 
there are two well marked black eyes. The tip of the head is elongated

Polycirrus phosphoreus, sp. nov. 

A large, handsome, bright red species, remarkable for its brilliant 
violet-blue i)hosphorescence when disturbed. 

Body very changeable in form, soft and flaccid, usually swollen ante- 
riorly, narrowing somewhat near the head, and more attenuated poste- 
riorly. Tentacles very numerous, originating from an elongated and 
somewhat spatuliform cephalic process. Fascicles of acute, capillary 
setiiB exist on twenty-four segments. The unciui commence on the tenth 
setigerous segment. They are minute, strongly hooked, and form a 
linear row, consisting of about twenty on the tenth segment, and of thirty 
to forty on the succeeding ones. The posterior region not h'aviug 
capillary set?e consists of thirty or more segments, toward the end 
becoming very short and indistinct. Anal segment small, simple, with 
a minute papilla. Ventral glandular shields conspicuous on the nine 
anterior segments, covering the whole ventral siuface, becoming nar- 
rower backward, and bilobed; beyond the ninth segment the ventral 
shields are smaller and more distant, squarish, bilobed, and s<iparated 
by a median furrow. On the nine anterior segments there is also a 
thickened, annular, light-colored, glandular area, just below the fasci- 
cles of set*; farther back these become rudimentary. Color bright red 
or blood-red. In August, females were tilled with large quantities of 
light red ova. Length, up to 75""" to 80'"™; greatest diameter, 4""" to 5'""'.

tips and uumerous lateral i^rocesses. Operculum elongated obconic, 
hollow, coutaiuiug- the eggs ; pedicel slender at base, enlarging gradu- 
ally to the operculum. 

Massachusetts Bay to Nova Scotia, common, in 10 to SO fathoms, on 
shells and stones. 

Tomopteris Smithii, sp. nov. 

A large and very elegant species, remarkablytransparent and exceed- 
ingly active in its motions. Outline, including lateral appendages, elon- 
gated oval or lanceolate, the length being about three and one-half 
t imes the breadth. Head with two small ej'es, near together ; tv\'o short, 
tapering, acute antennae, and two very long and slender cirriform pro- 
cesses, nearly half as long as the body; these originate from broad 
subconical bases. The lateral appendages of the body commence close 
to the head; the first are about equal to the diameter of the body, 
but those at about the anterior third are twice as long, while the poste- 
rior ones become very small and more distant ; the tail ends in a nar- 
row, naked portion, of considerable length. The lateral appendages 
taper from the base to the fork, where they divide into tv,'o lobes, each 
consisting of a broad, elliptical, and very thin membrane, supported by 
an acute central branch of the main stem. The naked caudal portion 
in one specimen had about six faint bands of reddish, not seen in tlie 
other ; all other parts are so limpid as to be nearly invisible in clear water. 
The interior of the body and appendages contained uumerous eggs. 
Length, Oo'"""' and 70"^"^; breadth across appendages, 18"-"'; length of 
middle appendages, 7™" ; of long cephalic appendages, liD""'". 

Eastport, Me., August, 1872, two specimens, at surface. Named in 
honor of Professor S. I. Smith, who first discovered it. 

GEPHYRiEA. 

Priapulvis pygmaeus, si>. iiov. 

A small yellowish white or flesh-colored species. In extension the pro- 
boscis is usually slightly clavate, nearly as long as the body, and often 
somewhat greater in diameter. The proboscis is distinctly longitudinally 
marked with about twenty-five white, muscular lines, between which 
there are as many rows of small, prominent, conical papilkie, largest 
toward the mouth and disappearing on the posterior third. Body usu- 
ally cylindrical, changeable, abruptly tapered or subtruncate at the pos- 
terior end, distinctly anuulated, with fine circular and longitudinal lines 
on the annulations ; at the posterior end having very small conical pa- 
pillae on the annulations. Caudal appendage in length about equal to 
diameter of body, with a rather stout stem, bearing about twelve short, 
fusiform papilheor branches, which are changeable in form, and covered 
with small conical papillaj. The integument is so translucent that the 
corpusculated circulating fluid can be easily seen circulating in the 
hollow stem and tubercles. The corpuscles are minute and round. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 183 

Pharynx provided with numerous teeth in longitudinal rows, each with 
a whitish, slightly curved, acute, central denticle. Intestine brown, 
scarcely longer than the body. Proboscis whitish or pale flesh-color; 
body and caudal appendage yellowish. Largest seen were about 15""^ 
long and 2"^"^ in diameter. Described from life. The form of the body 
and proboscis continually changes. 

Massachusetts Bay, off Plymouth, 27 fathoms, soft mud; Harbor do 
Luth, Campo Bello Island, Bay of Fimdy, 4 to 5 fathoms, soft mud 
(U. S. Fish Commission, July 30, 1872). 

Thalassenia viridis, sp. uov. 

A small bright green species with swollen body and long slender 
proboscis, somewhat spoon-shaped at the end. Body round, thick, 
about twice as long as broad, largest and obtusely rounded post(#iorly ; 
the surface is minutely grainilous in appearance, the granules in circu- 
lar lines ; anteriorly the body rapidl}^ narrows to the base of the probos- 
cis, where there are two small spines at the mouth. The proboscis is so 
infolded at the edge as to form a groove, like a spout, which expands 
near the end ; it is longer than the body. Color bright grass-green. 
Length of body, about C""^. Described from life. 

Off Head Harbor, Campo Bello Island, 77 fathoms, mud, 1872. Found 
in holes in hard nodules of blue clay. 

NEMERTINA. 

Amphiponis virescens, sp. uov. 

Body long, slender, tapering gradually to the tail, widest anteriorly 
in extension. Active in its movements. Head ordinarily obtusely 
rounded in front. Ocelli numerous, forming a very long lateral cluster 
on each side of the head ; anteriorly each cluster consists of several 
rows, but it narrows backward to a single row, which extends back 
beyond the head and neck. Color clear pale green, varying in tint. 
Length of largest specimens seen, about 40"^'". 

New Haven and Noank, Conn. ; Wood's Holl, Mass., etc. Common 
among hydroids on the piles of wharves. 

Amphiporas agOis Vcrrill {:^Opliioncmcrtcs o^tZ/s Verrill, Am. Jotir. Science, vii, p. 45, 
pi. 7, fig. 1). 

This species belongs to Amphlporus, as characterized by M'Intosh. 
It has only been taken in 20 to 00 fathoms, oft^ the coast of Maine. 

Amphiporas roseus Yerrill {—Planaria rosea Miiller). 

The species which I thus identify is common in Massachusetts Bay 
and the Gulf of Maine, on muddy bottoms, in 20 to 100 fathoms. It 
agrees well with the original figures and descriptions, but does not agree 
with A. jnilclier, to which JM'Intosh refers Miiller's species, erroneously it 
seems tome. The color above is usually deep cherry-red to reddish 
brown, varying toward orange aud chocolate-brown ; beneath, flesh color. 



184 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Ocelli ill two large clusters ou each side of the head, the anterior groups 
largest, somewhat triangular, covering the antero-lateral margins and 
extending upward and backward on the head, where they terminate on 
each side in a small subdorsal group of ocelli, more distinct than the 
rest; just back of these are two distinct clusters of ocelli. Transverse 
fossne rnn up on each side, in line with the posterior groups of ocelli. 
Proboscis large, finely papillose, reddish. Length, 50""" or more. 

I have also met with another species, which agrees nearly with A. 
2)nlehcr, as described by M'lutosh, and with which it is probably 
identical. 

Amphiporus Stimpsoni Vorrill (—Ommatojyha Stinn)soni Girard, in Stimpsou). 

This is very common in Massachusetts Bay and northward to the 
Bay §f Fundy and Labrador, from low-water mark, under stones, to 
100 tathoms. It is easily recognized by its clear, dark purplish or cho- 
colate-brown color above, with pale margins and a squarish or triangu- 
lar white spot ou each side of the head, and usually with a narrow 
white band across the neck ; beneath, pinkish or flesh-color. Ocelli in 
two or more rows in an elongated group on each antero-lateral margin 
of the head, and a pair of small subdorsal clusters on the transverse 
white nuchal band. Often 150'"'" long and S'"-" to 10'""' broad. 

The Planaria amjuhita of Otho Fabricius was probably based on this 
species ; but his description is insuthcient to determine this with cer- 
tainty. 

Amphiporus lactifloreus M'Intosb. 

Common at Eastport, Me., under stones, at low- water mark. Its color 
there is usually pale flesh-color, or dull whitish or grayish. Length, SO-"™ 
to 100""". 

Amphiporus cruentatus. sp. uov. 

A species peculiarly characterized by ha\ing red blood, so that the 
vessels appear distinctly red through the translucent integument. Body 
flaccid, versatile, slender, tapering to both ends; head not very distinct ; 
snout strongly ciliated. Ocelli about 12 on each side of the head, in 
an interrupted longitudinal row, the most anterior one considerably 
larger. Two slight transverse grooves on each side of the head, appar- 
ently not extending across the dorsal side, but the anterior ones curve 
forward in front of the ganglia, and the posterior ones behind the 
ganglia. Proboscis long, densely covered with elongated, conical papil- 
lae. A simple central stylet and two small lateral ones on each side. 
Color light reddish salmon, with conspicuous bright red median and 
lateral blood-vessels, containing a corpusculated red fluid. 

Vineyard Sound, 4 to 5 fathoms, July 21, 1875. 

Tetrastemma vermiculus Elir. (?); M'lntosh. 

This species, as determined by M'Intosh, was common on the piles of 
wharves at Gloucester, Mass., in 1878. Color pale grayish or yellowish,

usually with more or less distiuct brownish. mottUngs along the sides, 
due to internal organs. The two pairs of ocelli are rather distant, and 
usually there is a dusky line extending between the two eyes of the 
same side. On the head, in front of the eyes, there are often tlake- white 
specks 5 and frequently others occur along the middle of the back. ISot 
before recorded from the American coast. 

Tetrastemma vittata Vorrill. 

American Journal of Science, vol. vii, ]}. 45, j)!. 7, figs. 3, a, h, 1874 ; Proc. Amer. 

Assoc, for Adv. of Science for 1873, p. 389, pi. 2, figs. 7, 8, 1874. 
Cosmocepliala (?) cordiceps (Sars, MSS. ), Jensen, Turbellaria ad Litora Norvegite, 

p. 82, tab. viii, figs. 13-16, 1879. 

The species described by Jensen from the coast of Norway agrees so 
•well, in form and color, with our T. vittata, as to render its identity 
highly probable. The eyes were not observed by Sars in the l^orwegian 
specimens, but they are often so obscured by the very dark color of the 
head, in our darkest examj^les, as to be almost invisible. 

This species was dredged in considerable numbers this season in Cape 
Cod Bay, 16 to 22 fathoms, mud, by the U. S. Fish Commission. Some 
of the specimens were 3 inches long. 

Liueus viridis Verrill (== Planaria viridis Fabr.). 

Liiicns Gesserensis M'Intosli. — Ncmcrtes viridis Verrill, Report on Invert, of 
Vineyard Sd., etc., p. 334 [628]. 

This species is exceedingly abundant on our coast, from the Arctic 
Ocean to Long Island Sound. It occurs gregariously under stones, be- 
tween tides, and also at the depth of several fiithoms. The most abund- 
ant variety is green, varying from dull olive-green to greenish black, 
the anterior end usually darkest, and the ventral surface paler than the 
back. The transverse Ught lines are usually indistinct. Length, often 
150""" or more. 

Var. fusca (^ Planaria ftisca Fabr.). 

This variety occurs like the last, and is usually associated with it. The 
color varies from pale reddish brown to dark brown and greenish brown. 

Lineus communis Van Beueden. 

This species, accurately described and figured by Van Beueden, is very 
common, often occurring in large groups under stones and among 
muscles, on muddy shores, between tides (Eastport, Me., to Long Island 
Sound). It much resembles the preceding species in form and color, 
but is more slender, with a more elongated head, the mouth being 
farther back. The color is usually dark olive-green to greenish black, 
but varies to brownish and dull reddish. Ocelli black, often rather in- 
distinct in dark specimens, forming a single lateral row on each side of 
the head. It is probable that L. socialis (Leidy sp.) is not distiuct from 
this.

Micrura affinis Y. (=Po?irt affinis Girard, in Stimpsoii). 

This species is very common from Massachusetts Bay to the Bay of 
Fundy, in 10 to 100 fathoms, on hard bottom. It is usually bright clear red 
or reddish brown above, rarely varying toward dark olive-green ; beneath, 
pinkish white ; front of head with a white margin running back in a short 
median i)oint. Ocelli black, several in a single row on each margin of

2.5™™ to 3""™. 

Common in the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay, on muddy bot- 
toms, in from 30 to 140 fathoms. 

NEMATODA ? 
Nectonema, gen. uov. 

Body long, slender, nearly round, smooth. Head without appendages, 

obtusely rounded or blunt-conical, apparently with the mouth on the 

under side. Along each side of a considerable part of the length of the 

body, posteriorly, there is a delicate fin, composed of very numerous, 

slender, hair-like processes, apparently in two close alternating rows 

(perhaps in life connected together by a delicate web). In the supposed 

male, the tail is more or less incurved, tapered to a small i)ai)illiform tip. 

Ko external sexual organ visible. In the larger form, regarded as 

female, the posterior end is subtruncate, with a small terminal papilla. 

Nectonema agilis, sp. uov. 

A long, slender, and exceedingly active, round worm, resembling a 
Gordins, found swimming at the surface with a rapid, eel-like, undula- 
tory motion. Integument firm, opaque, generally smooth, but with 
minute, oblong, brown verrucie posteriorly. Body, in hfe, nearly round, 
slightly flattened on two sides, of nearly uniform size throughout, but 
slightly tapered close to the somewhat smaller, depressed, obtusely coni- 
cal head, and somewhat more gradually tapered to the ijosterior end in 
the male. The peculiar fins are generally more or less injured, even in 
life, so that their real length is difficult to determine; but they appear 
to occuijy half the length of the body, and perhaps more. In lite they 
ai^pear to have a continuous web, binding the hair-like rays together, but 
whether it was anything more than mucus is uucertahi. The fin-rays, in 
length, are more than half the diameter of the body. Owing to the opacity 
of the integument, little could be seen of the internal structure without 
dissection or the i3reparation of transverse sections, for which no suit- 
able opportunity occurred. In the head, which is more translucent, there 
appeared to be four roundish bodies, visible by transmitted light, while 
a transverse whitish band behind tbese seemed to indicate the position 
of the mouth. At the posterior end there seemed to be an anal oi>euing, 
and a straight intestine leading to it. In some female specimens, a cen- 
tral whitish line, due to an internal organ (intestine f), could be traced 
from the head to the extreme posterior end, and a yellowish white organ 
(ovaries ?), with numerous transverse divisions, extending from near the 
head to the tail, could be indistinctly seen. Color, in life, grayish or 
yellowish white, with four narrow, double, longitudinal lines of dark 
slate-color. Length, 80™™ to 200™"'; diameter, O-S"""^ to 1™™.

P6LY20A. 

Alcyouidium rubrum, sp. uov. 

An encrusting species, forming broad, smooth colonies, covering stones 
and hirge shells. Zocecia rather large, mostly hexagonal, but often pent- 
agonal, with their boundaries well-marked in alcoholic specimens by a 
distinct line. The retracted zooids in preserved specimens usually forni 
a small papUla in the middle of the zocecia. Color, in life, bright brick- 
red, or sometimes orange-red. 

Common all along the coast, from Long Island Sound to Nova Scotia, 
mostly in 10 to 50 fathoms, and especially on Fecien tenuieostatus. 

Bugtila cucullata Verrill, Amer. Jour. Sci., xviii, p. 52, July, 1879. 

Zoarium nuich branched, branches slender, tlichotomously divided, the 
branchlets diverging but little. Zo«cia in two alternating rows, rather 
*large, elongated, narrow, with tlie long, narrow, frontal area occupying 
most of the length. At the distal angles there are usually two rather long 
slender spines on each side, but often three on tlie outer angle. The 
•spines are unequal, divergent, more or less curved and diret^ted upward; 
the one farthest in front is usually longest, curved forward and upward 
at base. Avicularia large, elongated, the length greater than the width 
of the zocecia, situated rather in advance of the middle of the outer 
margin of the frontal area, the beak reaching beyond the distal end of 
the zocecia; the head is compressed, broad-oval, and tapers below at the 
posterior end into the pedicel, which is thick at first, but narrows to a 
slender base ; the beak is long, concave above, but strongly incurved or 
hooked at the tip. Ooecia short, but wide, nearly hemispherical, the 
front edge turned upward, showing a large opening in a front view, and 
giving them a hood-like appearance; surface more or less areolated, 
glistening. 

Jelirey's Ledge, off' Maine, 51 fathoms, taken by Dr. A. S. Packard 
and Mr. C.Cooke, while dredging on the "Bache," in 1871, for the Fish 
Commission. A second specimen of this fine species was dredged this 
season, oil Cape Cod, in 75 fathoms, mud. When placed in alcohol, it 
quickly bec^ame bright rose-red ; but the alcohol soon dissolved the color, 
becoming light pink, while the specimen became white. 

Bugiila decorata Verrill, Amcr. Jour. Sci., xviii, p. 52. 

Zoarium rather large, with thick, iinich branched stems, producing 
densely branched, somewhat plumose tiifts, two inches or more high. 
Branches uuecpially dichotomous, often somewhat spirally arranged. 
Zocecia in two alternating rows, large, broad, prolonged proximally. 
Frontal area large, elongated, sunken and wrinkled in the dry state. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 189 

The distal angles are prolonged into a single, stout, often short spine on 
each side, frequently absent on the inner angle. Avicularia on the 
middle of the front side of the zooecia, toward the base ; they have a 
short, broad, swollen head, with a short, strongly curved beak ; the pedi- 
cels are short and thick, raj^idly enlarged from the base upward. Ooicia 
large, globose, brilliantly iridescent, elegantly sculptured, with a series 
of raised curved lines passing up over each side and converging to the 
middle of the front side, while their concave interspaces are covered with 
microscopic transverse lines. Dredged at Eastport, Me., by the writer, 
and also in the Gulf of Maine, 110 fathoms, near George's Bank, by Dr. 
A. S. Packard and Mr. C. Cooke, in 1872 (U. S. Fish Commission). 

The other species of Bugula found on the ^N^ew England coast are as

with an oval frontal area, surrounded by spines. 

Off' George's Bank, 220 fathoms, on Acanella. 

CELLULARIDiE. 

Xotwirhstanding the very numerous restrictions which the ancient 
genus Ccllularia has undergone, it is still made to include heterogeneous 
species by several receiit writers, while others restrict it to groups not 
originally included by Pallas. In the excellent memoirs of Smitt on the 
Arctic Bryozoa, Ave species still remain in the genus CeUularia. These 
belong, however, to three well-marked groups, some of which have 
received several generic names, so that their synonymy is very compli- 
cated. Having had occasion to revise this family, I offer the following 
summary, so far as it concerns the Kew England species.

190 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

L CvUularia Pallas, 176S, (restricted). Zooecia unilateral, iu two alternatiug rows, 
mostly protected by lateral spines, either simple or dilated. Vibracula and lat- 
eral and median avicularia present. Ty^ie C. scruposa* 
a. Subgenus Cdhdaria ( = Scrupocellaria, pars, Gray, Busk). Lateral spines all simple. 
h. Subgenus Cellarina Van Ben. (incl. TriccHarla Flem., 1828). One of the lateral 
spines usually more or less dilated and often expanded in a shield-like form in 
front of the zooecia. Two New England species : C. scdbra Van Ben. and C. ternata 
(Sol.), with varieties gracilis and duplex (Smitt). 

The name Tricellaria (given to iernata) might have been adopted for this sub- 
genus, but it is very inapplicable to the grouj), and even to the type-species, 
as now known. 

n. Scruparia Oken (restricted) { = Scriqjoccllaria, jjrtcs, Gray; Cauda Busk, non Lamx.). 
Lateral avicularia and vibracula absent. A lateral spine develops into a pro- 
tective (often frondose) shield. Type S. reptans (Linn6), not yet found on the 
American coast. 

III. Buf/nlopsis VeiTill {=i Cellular ia, pars, Busk, non Pallas). Characterized by the 
simxile, unai'med zooecia, arranged iu alternatiug rows, and destitute of avicu- 
laria, vibracula, and shields. Type C. Peachii (Busk), Gulf of Maine and Bay 
of Fundy. European seas, north to Spitzbergcn. 

As no species of the last gTonp was originally included in Celhilaria, 
it is inadmissible to restrict that name to it. Either reptans or scruposa 
should be taken as the type of CclluJaria, both having been originally 
included by Pallas, as well as by most subsequent authors. Scruparia t 
Oken (1815) originally included not only the group that had previously 
been named Eucraiea by Lamouroux (1812), but also 8. reptans. There- 
fore there seems to be no good reason why it should not be restricted, 
as above, rather than be displaced by the much later and more objec- 
tionable name, Scrupocellaria. Menqyca, used by Busk and others for 
Cellarina, is inadmissible, in that sense, for the original group named 
Menipea by Lamouroux is a valid and very distinct genus. Ca nda (Lamx., 
ISIO), adopted by some for Cellularia reptans, cannot j^roperlj' be so used, 
for the original tyije is a distinct genus. 

Porellina stellata Yerrill, Amer. Jour. Sci., xviii, p. 53. 

A large species, forming radiating patches on shells, etc. Zocecia ar- 
ranged in quincunx, large, broad, moderately convex, white, shining, 
mostly imperforate and smooth, the marginal ones more or less perfo- 
rate iu front. Apertures nearly semicircular, the proximal edge straight 
or nearly so, often with two spines on the distal border; median pore, a 
short distance from the aperture, large, nearly circular, provided with 
numerous, slender, convergent spinules, which nearly i-eacli the center, 
giving the pore a stellate appearance. Avicularia near the lateral mar- 
gin, about opposite the median pore, varying in size and form ; in the 
same colony some are short triangular, others long triangular, while 
others with a long and acute erect tip show the transition toward vibra- 

* This species has been recorded from the Gulf of St. Lawrence by Packard and 
othe-s, but I have myself seen no American examples. 

tThis name has recently been given to a new genus, in a new sense, by Hincks, in 
accordance v.'ith a practice that is nearly always unsafe, as well as confusing.

cula. Length of zooecia, O.GO"'" to 0.70™™ ; breadtli, 0.50™'" to O.GO™™ ; 
breadth of apertures, 0.12™™ to 0.15™™ ; of median pore, 0.05™™ to O.OG™™. 
The zooecia are about twice as hxrge as those of P. ciliata. 

Casco Bay, Maine (U. S. Fish Commission, 1873). 

In the nearly circular form of the median pore this species approaches 
the genus Porina, as restricted by Smitt (Florida Bryozoa); but in all 
other respects, except size, it agrees so closely with P. ciUafa, made the 
type of Porellina by Smitt, as to forbid a generic separation, although 
the latter has a crescent-shaped pore. 

TMc genus Porellina was, however, originally established by D'Or- 
bigny for erect fossil species, having the surface foveolated. In his sys- 
tem, the present species would belong to Rejytoporina, based on the 
encrusting forms with aperture and special pore as in Porina. Perhaps 
it may be desirable to separate generically the species having the hemi- 
spherical apertures, median ciliated pore, and sublateral avicularium, 
as in this species and P. ciliata, whatever be their mode of growth. 

Mr. Hincks has recently proposed a genus, Microporella, with P. 
ciliata as type, which might also, if adopted, include the present species. 
Dipoi'ula Hincks* seems scarcely worthy of generic separation from 
the latter. 

Smittia Hincks (=EschareJla Smiti, non Gray). 

The genus Pscharella, as defined by Smitt, still included somcAvhat 
heterogeneous species. The form of the zooecial aperture, chiefly relied 
upon by both Smitt and Hincks, proves to be a rather indefinite charac- 
ter, since it varies in the form and breadth of the siiuis, in the several 
species now known, from an ill-defined, broad, sballow sinus, nearly as 
in Lepralia, to a deep and narrow one, like that of Uscharina {Hippotlioa 
Smitt). It would appear best, therefore, to combine, with the form of 
the aperture, the presence of a median avicularium in front of the 
sinus, or within its margin. The mere form of growth, presence or ab- 
sence of pores in the zocecia and ocecia, are of no importance generically, 
as Smitt has well shown. This restriction would exclude E. sangui- 
nea Sm., P. Jacotini Sm., and some other species, most of which can be 
well referred to Escliarina {ScMzoporella Hincks), as here limited. The 
species first described in 1853, by Stimpson, as Flustra solida {=Esckara 
palmata Sars), and referred to Pscharella by Smitt, seems, however, 
worthy of generic separation, on account of the chitinous fibres 
strengthening the zoarium. It appears to belong to the genus Flusfri- 
morpha Gray, so far as can be determined by his description, in which 
the position of the avicularia is not mentioned, nor even the exact form 
of the zocecial apertures. 

As to the correct name for this natural and important genus, there 
is still room for diversity of opinion. Pscharella Gray, 1848, {non D'Or- 
bigny), certainly ought not to have been restricted to this division, for 
*Aiiiials and Magasiue of Natural History, vol. iii, p. 156, Feb., 1879.

it included only three species, neither of which belongs to the present 
group. Moreover, his first species {inwiersa) and third species {variolosa, 
in i^art) belong to the older genus Usckaroides, as restricted and adopted 
by him in the same work. The second is a Porina or PoreUlna. There- 
fore it would be better to regSiTd JEscharcUa as a synonym oH Eschar oides 
Edw. (1835), in Gray's restricted sense. Escharella D'Orbigny (1852) 
was established wholly independently of Gray's genus, and is a group 
entirely distinct from Gray's, and if the name is to be used at all, it 
should be used only in D'Orbiguy's sense. Smittia, recently proposed by 
Hinclcs (Ann. and Mag., Feb., 1879), may well be adopted, therefore, for 
the present group. The following species, from our coast, belong to this 
genus : 

Smittia porifGi-a (Smitt) Hincks. Massachusetts Bay to Labrador, 
common. 

Smittia Candida (Stimp.) Verrill. Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, etc. 

Smittia glob if era (Packard) Verrill. CascoBay to Labrador, common. 

Smittia auriculata (Hassal?) Verrill. Gulf of Maine. 

Smittia Landsborovii (Johnst.) Hincks. Massachusetts Bay, north- 
ward, common. 

Smittia bella (Busk) Hincks. Gulf of St. Lawrence (WTiiteaves). 

The last species I have not seen from our coast; but I have at least 
two additional, undetermined species. 

Smittia Candida V . {^= Lcj)ralia Candida Stiuipsou). 

This species has been entirely misunderstood by Suiitt and others, 
owing doubtless to the imperfection of tlie original description. Stimp- 
son's figure, however, represents very well the form of the aperture and 
of the zooecia in young colonies, without ooecia and avicularia. The 
zooecia are rather large, and conspicuously perforated over the front; 
the aperture has a distinct rounded sinus. The avicularia, which are 
usually absent on many or most of the zooecia of a colony-, are large, 
obtusely rounded at the end, commonly placed transversely just in front 
of the sinus, or sometimes partially within it, but on some crowded 
colonies varying much in direction, some being direct, others oblique, 
others transverse. Ooecia large, globose, usually perforate, but some- 
times, wheti highly calcified, the pores mostly disappear, or become 
small, and the surface becomes rough and granulous. It is very closely 
related to S. 2>orifera, but has larger zooecia and avicularia, while the 
usual obliquity of the latter is generally distinctive. 

Smittia globifera V. [—-Lcpralia ijJohlJ'era Packard, Canadian Naturalist, vol. viii, 

p. 40S). 

This species is very closely related to S. auriculata, ydtli Avhichlhave, 
in former papers, united it. As compared with an authentic English 
specimen of S. auriculata, received from the Kev. A. M. Xorman, the 
zooecia and avicularia are about one-half larger, but of nearly the same 
form. The zooecia are less regularly i^erforated. In our species, tlie 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 193 

ooecia are prominent, but scarcely globose, the front surface being more 
or less flattened, and perforated with rather large pores, which are 
mostly confined to the flattened front surface. The median avicularium 
is well-rounded, direct, and just in front of the well-defined sinus. This 
species occurs in the encrusting (Lepralian) form, and also in the various 
foliaceous (Hemescharine) states, sometimes cup-shaped, saucer-shaped, 
and hat-shaped, according to place of growth. It is very common in the 
Bay of Fuudy and on the Grand Banks. 

Escharina Edw., 1835, = HippofIwa (jjars) Smitt, = ScMzojm-cIla Hincks, 1879. 

Edwards, in estabhshing this generic group, assigned a definite spe- 
cies as its type {U. vulgaris Moll) ; and although he afterwards united 
with it several incongruous species, the name ought to be retained for the 
group including his specified type. The earlier name, Rippothoa Lamo- 
roux, adopted by Smitt for this group and the true Hippothoa, combined 
with it by him, should, of course, be retained for the group typified by H. 
divaricata, from which R. lujaUna (type of CcUeporcUa Gray) does not 
appear to me to be generically distinct. The name given by Edwards, 
being next in order,* and definitely applied, should, therefore, be retained 
for the present group. JMoreover, Gray, in 1848, when restricting the 
genus, retained the name for the typical group. The name Rerentia 
Gray, as restricted by Smitt, would also be available for this group, if 
Uscharina could properly be rejected. In any case, the new name pro- 
I)Osed by Hincks seems wholly unnecessary. 

Escliarina, as understood by me, includes those species which have 
the primary zooecial aperture more or less subcircular, with a distinct, 
often narrow, median sinus, and with the avicularia lateral, when devel- 
oped. Mode of growth various, but more generally encrusting in a sin- 
gle layer; sometimes, as in E. Isabelliana, forming thick masses, consist- 
ing of numerous layers of cells. Our species, so far as determined, are^ 
as follows: 

Escharina IsahelUana D'Orb. = ^. variabilis Leidy. 

Escharina reversa Verrill. Perhaps a variety of the preceding. 

Escharina linearis (Hassal). 

Escharina hiaperta (Mich.). 

Escharina secundaria (Smitt). 

Escharina ansata (Johnst.) Gray. 

Escharina porosa Verrill, sp. nov. 

One or two undetermined species are also in our collection. 

Escharina porosa Verrill, sp. nov. 

Escharella 2)ertusa Yerril[, Amer. Journ. Sci., vol. x, p. 41, 1875, (non Smitt). 
Zoarium encrusting sheUs and stones. Zooecia large, oblong, perfo- 
rated by numerous, rather large, round pores ; apertures large, roundish, 

* The name Escharina was used by Ehreuberg in 1834 as the name of the family, but 
in that sense-it was a synonym of Escharidw Fleming, 1828, and consequently might be 
used as a generic name in another sense. 

Proc. iTat. Mus. 79 13 Nov. 5,18 79. 



194 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

wit'li a broad, shallow, median sinus, and small, lateral, opercular denticles. 
Ooecia large, piomineut, globose, the surface rough with sharp gran- 
ules, and jierforated by small, inconspicuous pores. Avicularia scarce, 
often absent, when present lateral, opposite the side of the aperture, 
broad, obtusely rounded, the point directed toward the zooecial aper- 
ture. Color, when dry, reddish brown. 

Vineyard Sound and Long Island Sound, 8 to 12 fathoms, common. 

The species here described has a close resemblance to both S.porifera 
and 8. Candida, and when the avicularia and ocecia are wanting it will 
not be easy to distinguish them. The resemblance to 8. Candida is 
l^articularly close, and extends even to the ooecia, but these are rougher 
and less porous in E.porosa, The situation and form of the avicularium 
are, however, the best diagnostic characters. 

This species is closely related to E. sangmnea (Norman) of Europe. 
It also has a general resemblance to E.pcrtusa (Esper), as described by 
Smitt ; but there appears to be great confusion in regard to the identifi- 
cation of the latter, and doubtless several species have been confounded 
under that name. Hincks refers pertusa to Lepralia. American writers 
have referred several distinct species to pertusa, and I am not sure that 
the genuine pertusa inhabits our coast. The species thus named by 
pawson, on examination of specimens kindly furnished by him, proves 
to be Smittia par if era. Probably 8. Candida has also been identified as 
pertusa by some writers. 

The generic relations of the species, well described and figured by 
Smitt as Escharella Jacotini (Aud.), has been variously determined. 
In Gray's system, it appears to have been united with one of the forms 
of Escharoides coccinea, under the name of variolosa, and referred to 
Escharella. Smitt placed it under Escharella in a special subdivision. 
It seems to me, however, to have more definite relations to the genus 
Discopora, as defined by Smitt, aud more particularly to that subdivision 
of Discopora which includes D.pavonella, D. appensa, etc., characterized 
by having lateral avicularia, and with a median denticle at the proximal 
edge of the primary zocecial aperture, and to which the name Mncronella, 
given by Hincks to the group called Discopora by Smitt, may be prop- 
erly restricted. 

We may subdivide Discopora into three natural groups, easily de- 
fined, as follows : 

Discopora Lamarck {pars), restricted by Edw. {von Fleming; non Gray). 

Dincoporu {pars) Smitt, Skandiuaviens Hafs-Bryozoer, p. 25, 1868. Palmicellarta 
{pars) Hincks. 

The type of this genus, as restricted by Edwards, was D. verrucosa 
Lam. (710)1 Esper). As shown by Edwards, this species is very distinct 
from Esper's species, aud is closely allied to the well-known D. 81ienei of 
the I^orth Atlantic. Gray was, however, misled by the quotation of 
Esper's name in the synonymy, and erroneously took Esper's species as 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 195 

the type of Biscopora. Hincks attributed the name to Fleming, who 
used it in a different sense, and, apparently overlooking the fact that the 
name originated with Lamarck, rejected it for the original gronp. 

Biscopora, as I propose to restrict it, is characterized by having both 
median and lateral avicularia, with the former (or both) oiieu raised on a 
prominence in front of the zooecial aperture. B. Sl-enei, with its Lepra- 
lian form described as L. crassispina by Stimpson, is the only known 
New England si)ecies. 

Escharoides Edw., in Lam., 1835; Gray (restr.), 1848, (noii Smitt). 
Mucronella {pars) Hincks, 1879, 
Type E. coccinea (Abildg.), as defined by Smitt,= jB. Feachii (Johnston). 

This group includes those species of Biscoporidcc having a prominent 
median denticle, but without avicularia. The zooecial aperture is usually 
somewhat raised, and is often armed with marginal spines. As E. 
coccinea was one of the species originally included by Milne Edwards, 
Gray's restriction was correctly made, and should be adopted. 

The typical species, with several varieties, abounds on our coast. 

Mucronella Hincks (restricted), Ann. & Mag., iii, p. 162, 1879. 

Discopora {pars) Smitt, Skandinaviens Hafs-Bryozoer, p. 25, 18G8. 

Characterized by having lateral avicularia on one or both sides of the 
zofficial aperture, but without the median avicularium. Median denti- 
cle of various forms, often small. Apertures armed or unarmed with 
spines. Growth various, most often encrusting, foliaceous, or lichen- 
like, sometimes forming thick crusts composed of many layers. Our 
species are as follows : 

Mucronella appensa (Hassal) Yerrill. 

Mucronella pavonella (Alder) Hincks. 

Mucronella nitida Yerrill = Biscopora nit i da V., 1875. 

Mucronella Jacotini (Aud.) V. = EscJiarella Jacotini Smitt. 

Mucronella scabra (Fabr.) V. = Biscopora scahra Smitt. 

M. scabra, var. lahiata (Stimj).) = Lepralia labiata Stimp. 

Mucronella ovata (Smitt) Y. = B. scabra, var. ovata Smitt. 

Mucronella nitida A-'errill. 

Discopora nitida Verrill, Amer. Journ. Sci., ix, p. 415, pi. Tii, fig. 3, 1875. 

This species is very abundant in Yiueyard - Sound and Long Island 
Sound. Although it is an encrusting species, when young often forming 
small, thin, radiating patches, when old it forms thick, irregular, cellular 
crusts, composed of numerous layers of cells. Some of these finally 
become large, subglobular masses, with an uneven surface, sometimes 
two inches or more in diameter. The color, when recently dried, is 
usually bright greenish yellow, sometimes brownish. The younger cells 
have the walls of both ocecia and zooecia uniformly perforated ; when 
older, the bounding walls become raised ; a marginal row of conspicuous 
pores remains, while those over the front mostly disappear, or are 
obscured by granules; the pores of the globose ooecia also mostly dis-

appear and their surface becomes roughly granulous. The lateral avicu- 
laria are generally abundant, very few cells being without one or both ; 
they vary somewhat in size, form, and position, but are usually small 
and near the aperture. The zooecial apertiu-e is small, always with a 
smaU, squarish mucro in front, and with a slender lateral process on 
each side for the articulation of the operculum. In the secondary stages 
of calcification, a strong, prominent, flat process often rises up on each 
side of the aperture. 

Mucronella scabra Verrill. 

The relationship of M. scahra is not always obvious, owing to the fact 
that usually only one large lateral avicularium is developed, and this is 
crowded so far in front of the zooecial aperture as to appear like a large, 
rostriform, median avicularium, facing sidewise. A careful examination 
of the young cells will, however, usually show some cells with two lateral 
avicularia, with the small median denticle of the aperture between them. 

Escharopsis Ver!:iH = Escharoidcs Smitt (now Edw.). 

Bulletin National Museum, No. 15, p. 149, 1879. 

I proposed this name for a group, including two of our larger, northern, 
Eschara-like species. The zoa?cial aperture has a narrow median sinus, 
which in the later stages of growth includes within it a small laterally 
placed avicularium, facing sidewise. The genus is otherwise apparently 
closely related to EscJiarina, CeUeporariaj and Beiepora.* Smitt, in his 
Florida Bryozoa, even referred one of the species to Betepora {B. rosacea). 
The growth of both our species is often Leprahan and fohaceous as well 
as Escharine.

TUNICATA. 

Ascidia inomata, sp. nov. 

In expansion the body is upright cyhndro-conical, about twice as high 
as broatl ; the base is about the same in diameter as the middle portion, 
and but very little expanded. The oral tube is much longer than the 
other, subterminal, swollen at base, tapering, the upper part cylindrical, 
the opening surrounded by seven low, rounded, thin lobes or crenula- 
tions, between which are seven orange-colored ocelli; corresponding 
with the ocelli there are seven thickened, j)ointed lobes or folds of the 
test, which niu down from them along the tube as slightly prominent 
costiie, with transverse wrinkles between them. The anal tube is sub- 
terminal, shorter and smaller, situated to one side, and only about half

his genus Discoporu, so as to include the northern species of Eetepora (B. cellulosa and 
Jx. dongata), and also the species here called Escharopsis rosacea. (Ofversigt af Kongl. 
Vet.-Akad. Forh., 1878, p. 30.)

like those of the other. Test moderately thick and firm, somewhat 
wrinkled, nearly glabrous, translucent, dull yellowish, blotched more or 
less with russet-brown. The internal organs show through faintly as 
yellow and dark markings. Height, in expansion, 32^""^; greatest

Halocynthia Verrill= Cynthia Savigny (non Fabr., 1808). 
Bulletin National Museum, No. 15, p. 147, 1879. 

This name was proposed for the restricted genus Ci/nthia of Savigny, 
characterized by having both apertiu'es quadrangular, and ovaries de- 
veloped on both sides. The species now known from our northeast 
coast are as follows : 

Halocyntlda ijyriformis (Eathke) = Cyntliia pyriformis authors. 

Halocynthia rustica (Linne) = Ascidia monoceros Moller. 

Salocynthia tuberctdum (Fabr.) = Cynthia carnea (Ag.) Yerrill. 

Halocynthia pulchella Verrill = Cynthia jpulchella Yerrill. 

Halocynthia echinata (Linne) = Cynthia echinata authors. 

Halocynthia partita (Stimp.) = Cynthia partita Stimpson. 

MOLLUSCA. 

Xylophaga dorsalis (Turton). 

Many lining specimens of this species have been found in bits of old 
wood, dredged in Casco Bay; in 100 to 110 fathoms, about thirty miles 
oft' Cape Ann ; and in various parts of Massachusetts Bay and Cape 
Cod Bay. It has previously been recorded by Mr. J. F. Whiteaves from 
Gaspe Bay. Found on the European coast south to the Adriatic.

Three living specimens of this species were dredged on Stellwagen's 
Bank, north of Cape Cod, in 26 to 32 fathoms, sand, by the XJ. S. Fisli 
Commission, 1879. It has not previously been recorded from the Amer- 
ican coast; but it was dredged in 1872 by Messrs. Smith and Harger, in 
45 fathoms, on Le Have Bank. It is easily distinguished from all oiu- 
other species of the group by its horny operculum and closed umbilicus. 
Except in the last character, it resembles L. immaculata. Its color is 
ivory-white, shining.

The species well-described and figured in the excellent work of Sars 
is identical with the American form. Our I), robustus was described 
from a specimen not fully grown ; but we have since dredged it of larger 
size, agreeing with 2). velifer, in numerous localities, from oft' Cape Cod

This species has been found, for the first time, upon the American 
coast, by Mr. J. H. Emerton, who discovered it at Salem, Mass., tliis 
season. He has kindly sent me a specimen and a colored drawing of the 
species, which he liad already determined. The specimen agrees very 
closely with Sars's description and figures, both in external characters 
and in dentition, but not so well with those of Alder and Hancock. 

ANTHOZOA. 

Bolocera multicoriiis, sp. nov. 

A large, handsome species, broad and low, with a multitude of mod- 
erate-sized tentacles, crowded in many rows, and covering the greater 
part of the disk. Column smooth, very short ; in our specimen the disk 
was so expanded that the margin was on a level with the base ; a smooth 
rim below the bases of the tentacles. Tentacles very numerous (several 
hundred), crowded in twenty or more indistinct, close, concentric rows, 
which entirely cover and conceal the disk, except a narrow, naked zone 
around the mouth ; they are changeable iu form, often cylindrical and 
blunt at tip, at other times fusiform, clavate, or swollen in any part, 
their length nearly equal in extension, and mostly less than a fifth of 
the diameter of the disk, or 14""" to 18""". The disk, as expanded, is reg- 
ularly convex, and the specimen showed no inclination to contract or 
withdraw its tentacles. Mouth with a distinct, gonidial groove at each 
end, bordered by a large fold or lobe on each side; sides of mouth with 
numerous irregular lobes or folds and wrinkles. Color of body and 
tentacles nearly uniform bright red-lead color or orange-scarlet ; mouth- 
folds a deeper tint of the same color. 

Diameter of expanded disk, about 3.75 inches, or 194'"'" 5 height at 
center, 30""" to 33'""^. 

One specimen only, dredged off Cape Cod, in 45 fathoms, shelly bot- 
tom, 1879 (U. S. Fish Commission). 

Edwardsia pallida, sj). nov. 

A long, slender, soft, flaccid, whitish species. Column smooth, desti- 
tute of any investment, but sometimes with grains of sand, slightly 
adherent; surface faintly longitudinally sulcated, and sometimes finely 
wrinkled transversely. The form is somewhat changeable, usually much 
elongated, nearly cylindrical, but often tapered at the posterior end. 
Tentacles about twenty-four, slender, the length about twice the diameter 
of the body, of nearly uniform diameter to near the tip, translucent 
whitish, often with a pale olive-green central line, interrupted by a line 
of opaque white ?pots, often ten to twelve on a tentacle, or sometimes

by transverse lines of white; tbe central dark line is sometimes absent; 
column translucent, dull gray or grayish white, striped with narrow 
flake- white lines, between which the dark internal organs show through ; 
a circle of lunate si)ots of opaque yellowish white is situated just below 
the tentacles, corresponding with the broad longitudinal stripes. Disk 
often much protruded, yellowish white, radiated with opaque white.

Anthothela, gen. nov. 

This generic division is proposed for the Briareum grandiflorum (Sars) 
and allied species. It is related to Briareum and Faragorgia in having 
a soft spiculose axis, but its polyp -cells are prominent and permaneutly 
exsert, and the polyps themselves are not entirely retractile. The ccen- 
enchyma is thin, and often spreads out irregularly over foreign bodies 
or around the base, as an encrustation. 

Anthothela grandiflora (Sara) Verrill. 

Briareum (jrandifloriim Sars, Fauna Litt. Norvegiae, p. 63, pi. 10, fig. 10-12. 
This species has been obtained in several instances by the Gloucester 
halibut fishermen in deep water, off Nova Scotia, and presented to the 
U. S. Fish Commission. It was first obtained by Capt. N. McPhee and 
crew, of the schooner " Carl Schurz," off Sable Island. 

Halipteris Christii (Koren and Dan.) Kolliker. 

A single specimen of a species of Halipteris, which is, perhaps, iden- 
tical with the above species, although difiering somewhat from the 
descriptions and figures of the Norwegian form, has been presented to the 
U. S. Fish Commission by Capt. Thos. F. Hodgdon and crew, of the 
schooner "Bessie W. Somes," from the Grand Bank. 

Alcyonium digitatum Linne (?). 

Two specimens, which I refer very doubtfully to this species, were 
taken by Captain Greenwood and crew, of the schooner "Sultana," in 80 
fathoms, on Clark's Bank, east of Cape Cod. 

They form low, thick, lobular masses, with the polyps scattered over 
the entire surface, except at the very base, and everywhere showing 
the coenenchyma between them. The base is somewhat spreading, and 
there is no main trunk, for the division into rounded or flattened lobes 
takes place close to the base, and they again subdivide, so that a group 
of short, thick, obtuse lobes, jiartly rounded and partly flat, results. 
The polyps are rather larger than in A. carneum, and some are retracted 
into the cells that are scattered over the coenenchyma, and others more 
or less expanded; toward the summits of the lobes they are more 
numerous, but not crowded. The surface of the cceneucliyma, under a 
lens, shows a granular api^earance, due to the small white spicula. 

If not identical with A. digitatum of Europe, it is at least very closely 



200 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

related, and belongs to the same section of the genus. A comparative 
study of the spicula has not yet been made. 

Alcyonium multiflorum, sp. nov, 

A hirge, upright species, with a tall bare trunk, which divides near 
the top into numerous divergent cylindrical branches, which are naked, 
except near the ends, where they again subdivide in the same way into 
secondary branches, which in turn divide again into a cluster of short, 
terminal branchlets. The ultimate branchlets bear at their ends an 
umbel-like cluster of crowded polyps, which in contraction form rounded 
groups. The whole forms a i^anicle-like structure, not unlike a cauli- 
flower — a resemblance noticed by the fishermen. The minute polyp- 
cells are closely crowded at the ends of the branchlets, so as to leave no 
naked coeuenchyma visible between them. They are apparently not 
retractile, but the tentacles are often contracted into eight rounded, mi- 
nute, rather rigid lobes at the summit of the polyps, which, in contrac- 
tion, have small, short bodies. The branches, branchlets, and trunk are 
usually sulcated in alcoholic specimens, and have a smooth, scarcely 
granular surface. The surface is smoother than in A. earnenm, though 
the structure of the ccenenchyma and interior is firmer and less flexible. 
Height, about 4 to 5 inches ; breadth, about 3 inches, in contraction. 
Some specimens are considerably larger. Color, in alcohol, yellowish 
white; in recently preserved specimens, bright red, stained with purple; 

Eeceived from Daniel McKinnon and crew, of the schooner "Mary F. 
Chisholm," i^. lat. 44° 06', W. long. 52° 54', 220 fathoms. Taken also 
by Captain John E. Wilson and crew, of the schooner " Polar Wave," in 
200 fathoms, N. lat. 44° 30', W. long. 57° 08', and in various other 
localities, in deep water, by the fishermen. Called sea-cauliflower by 
the fishermen. Closely related to A. caniemn, but diflers in having 
smaller polyps, which are so crowded as to show no bare coeuenchyma 
between their bases. The naked branches are longer and more panicled. 
It resembles in general appearance the Gorgonia florida Midler (Zool. 
Danica) ; but the latter appears not to be known to modern Scandi- 
navian -wTiters, and its afiinities are doubtful. 

Alcyonium Liitkeni, sp. nov. 

Alcyonium glomeratum Liitken, MSS. (won Johnston). 

Several specimens of a species agreeing perfectly with Greenland 
specimens sent to me several years ago, under the above MSS. name, 
by Dr. Chr. Liitken, were dredged in 52 fathoms, off Halifax, K. S., by 
the U. S. Fish Commission, in 1877. 

It may be distinguished by having the integument, especially of the 
polyp-bodies and bases of the tentacles, filled and covered with spicula, 
so as to render them decidedly rigid and incapable of complete con- 
traction. The main stem is upright, without polyps, giving oft' cylin- 
drical branches along the sides ; from these small lateral branchlets arise 
all along their sides as well as at their ends, each bearing a cluster of 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 201 

three to five, or more, polyp-cells, whicli are larger tlian in A. carneum, 
and, wlien contracted, are obovate, incurved, and sliow the bases of the 
eight tentacles as small terminal lobes. The spicnla are larger and 
rougher than in A. carneum and the two preceding species. Height, 3 
inches, or more. 

ECHINODERMATA. 
Tremaster, gen. nov. 

Body thin, pentagonal, the rays united by a thin interradial web ex- 
tending to their tips. Five interradial openings, situated toward the 
center of the disk, pass directly through to the lower side, where they 
open at the aboral side of the jaw-plates. Ambulacral grooves wide 
toward the month. Suckers in four rows. Upper surface covered with 
imbricated flat plates, which may bear granules and marginal spinules. 
Lower surface with suiall imbedded plates, bearing spines. 

Tremaster mirabilis, sp. nov. 

Body thick in the central region, very thin at the margin, the ends of 
the rays extending but little beyond the interradial margin, while the 
interradial web extends in a rounded lobe a little beyond the proper 
end of the rays, so that there is at the tip a shght but evident emargina- 
tion. In all the specimens, the body is bent upward in a very convex form, 
with the rays and margin bent abruptly downward, so that the edges 
are in contact with the ground, or nearly so, all around, leaving a large 
concavity underneath. The margin is thrown into a broad fold or un- 
dulation between the rays. On the dorsal surface, the imbricated plates 
of the radial regions are more prominent, thicker, and with a broader 
fi^ee portion than those of the interradial regions, and they bear a row, 
sometimes of eight to ten small, acute, appressed spines (often but one 
or two in the young) along the free edge ; these plates form, therefore, 
a regular rosette or star on the dorsal surface, its rays broad at the base 
and rapidly narrowed toward the margin, where the plates become very 
small and lack the spinules ; all the dorsal plates are covered with small 
scattered granules, often with one or several larger central ones. In the 
interradial areas, the plates are thin, flat, the inner or free ends are oval 
and destitute of spines, and each plate is usually overlapped by only two, 
laterally placed, and not by theone directly behind it, asinthe radial areas ; 
these plates are large and somewhat rhomboidal toward the central area 
of the disk, but become very small and rounded toward and at the margin ; 
each minute lower marginal plate bears a small ovate spinule, which form 
a close row or fringe around the margin. The central area of the disk is 
covered by large granulated plates; four or five, somewhat irregular in 
form, surround the central opening, which is protected by a circle of 
about twelve to eighteen small, obtuse spines. Madreporic plate prom- 
inent, close to the central opening, surrounded by small spinules. The 
five disk-perforations are large and conspicuous, when distended ellip- 
tical in form, and bordered by a row of small spines, which often con- 
verge above it. The interradial areas of the lower surface are formed

by small, more or less oblong plates, which become very small toward 
the margin ; each bears a spine, which toward the mouth are rather long 
and acute, gradually becoming shorter, flatter, and blunter toward the 
margin, near which they are spatulate, but close to the margin they be- 
come very small and slender. The adambulacral plates are transversely 
elongated ; each usually bears four spines, the two inner small, slender, 
acute, the innermost the smaller, and two outer much larger and stouter 
ones, the outermost nsually the largest, flattened and often slit or chan- 
neled at the end. The disk-perforations are large, rounded, with a 
smooth rim, and not surrounded by special spines. Jaw-plates promi- 
nent, each bearing at the oral end two or three long, acute spines, and 
others on the npper surface, while on the lateral margin a row of six or 
eight smaller, slender spinules, usually with a second row behind them, 
of fewer spines. Ambulacral snckers and pores large, arranged in two 
alternating rows on each side of the median line ; the grooves are broad 
and deep. 

Color of specimens recently preserved in alcohol, deep orange-red 
above, yellowish -white beneath. The surface is covered with a soft, thin, 
mucous layer. Greatest diameter of the largest specimen, 112™™; lesser 
or interradial diameter, 100"""; breadth of larger dorsal plates, 9™-" to 
II'"'" ; length of longest adambulacral spines, 8""°" to O-"'". A smaller 
one has the greater radius Co™™ ; lesser, 55™™ ; breadth of larger dorsal 
plates, G™™; length of largest adambulacral spines, 4™™ to 5™™; of inner 
ones, 1™™. 

This remarkable new starfish has hitherto been obtained only by the 
Gloucester halibut fishermen, who have presented three specimens to 
the U. S. Fish Commission. The first specimen was taken by Capt. 
Charles Anderson and crew, of the schooner "Alice G. Wunson," in 250 
fathoms, off George^s Bank, X. lat. 42° 08', W. long. 05° 31', April 28, 
1879. The largest specimen was taken by Capt. Thomas Olson and 
crew, of the shooner " Epes Tarr," in 150 fathoms, N. lat. 47° 00', W. 
long. 580 15'. Another specimen was taken in 220 fathoms, by Captain 
Kilpatrick and crew, of the schooner "Polar Wave," in N. lat. 44° 32', 
W. long. 570 09'. 

Porania spinulosa, sp. uov. 

Greater radius, 40™™; lesser radius, 23™™. Whole upper surface cov- 
ered with fine, sharp spinules. Pores on the dorsal surface very nu- 
merous, arranged in irregular groups of 6 to 15 or more, over the whole 
upper surface of the disk and rays, and in a marginal series between 
the upper and lower marginal plates. Lower marginal plates with a 
group of ten to twelve sharp spinules, in two or more rows on each 
plate. Lower surface with large, oblong, flat i)late8, separated by rad- 
ial grooves, and bearing at their outer ends a row of two or three small, 
appressed spines ; their sui'face bearing scattered, small, sharp gran- 
ules. Adambulacral spines sharp, in several rows; two inner ones

side by side on each plate ; one, sou^what stouter, farther out, alteruat- 
iug with them ; outside of these are usually two, obliquely placed, di- 
vergent and usually pointing toward the end of the rays; jaw-plates 
bearing somewhat larger acute spines. 

Color, in life, orange-red, mottled with brighter red on the dorsal 
side ; beneath, light yellow. 

Two characteristic specimens of this species have been dredged by 
the U. S. Fish Commission, off Cape Cod, in 80 fathoms, mud, 15 miles 
N. 6oO E. from Eace Point ; the other in 130 fathoms, mud, 26 miles E. 
by i^. from Eace Point Light. Another specimen was taken by Capt. 
Thomas Goodwin and crew, of the schooner "Howard," in 170 fathoms, 
N. lat. 450 25', W. long. 57° 10'. 

This species differs so much from typical Forania that it might well 
form a new generic type. It has not the smooth, naked skin of typical 
Porania. 

Archaster tenuispinus Duben and Koren. 

Several specimens of this species have been recently presented to the 
U. S. Fish Commission by the Gloucester halibut fishermen, from deep 
water, off the j^ova Scotia coast. It is a new addition to the American 
fauna. They vary in size from about 35"™ in diameter up to 250'"™. 

The largest specimen was presented by Capt. Daniel McKinnon and 
crew, of the schooner " Mary F. Chisholm." It was from 130 to IGO fath- 
oms, ]Sr. lat. 450 02', W. long. 56° llf. Two smaller ones, one from 128 
fathoms, N. lat. 40° 28', W. long. 55° 25', February, 1879, the other from 
250 fathoms, N. lat. 42° 40', W. long. 03° OG', were presented by Capt. 
Daniel McEachern and crew, of the schooner '^ Guy Cunningham." With 
the latter were fine specimens of the rare simple-armed Ophiuran, As- 
trochele Lymani Y., much larger than the original type. 

Astrophyton Lamarckii Miiller and Troschel. 

IsTumerous specimens of this species have been obtained in deep water 
off George's Bank and off" the Kova Scotia coast by the Gloucester fisher- 
men, and presented to the U. S. J'ish Commission. They are found 
clinging to Faragorgia arborea, Frimnoa reseda^ Alcyonium carneum, and 
other Alcyonaria. 

Easily distinguished from ^. Agassizii and A. eucnemis, both of which 
also occur in the same region, by the granulation of the disk, which is 
entirely covered, both over the ribs and interradial spaces, by coarse 
granules. 

Ophiacantha millespina, sp. nov. 

A five-rayed species, allied to 0. bidentata Ljung. (= 0. spimtlosa M. 
& Tr.), but distinguished readily by the very numerous and minute three- 
pronged and four-pronged, slender spines which thickly cover the disk. 
The mouth-plates are four-lobed or somewhat cross-shaped, the outer 
lobe narrow and long, extending into the interbrachial spaces ; the inner 
lobe is nearly triangular; the side-lobes are nearly as long as the outer 



204 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

lobe, but narrower. Mouth-papillae large, stout, subacute, usually three 
on each side of the jaw, the outermost thicker than the others, which 
are compressed. Arm-spines numerous, long, slender, tapered, sub- 
acute, translucent, rough with small acute spinules; the upper spines 
on the two or three joints just beyond the margin of the disk are longer 
than the rest, being considerably longer than the diameter of the arm; 
on the second joint beyond the disk the two rows nearly meet on the 
dorsal side, there being ten in each row; farther out the number is soon 
reduced to seven or eight, the upper ones longest, the lower ones short. 
Cnder arm-plates, near the base of the arms, short and broad, with a 
small central angle on the proximal edge; the distal edge curved. Far- 
ther out they rapidly become narrower and longer, the proximal angle 
becoming more prominent and the lateral edges being incurved, while 
the distal edge is convex. The ventral plates are separated by the side 
arm-plates. Diameter of disk, 11™™; length of arms, 45™™ to 50™™; of 
longest arm-spines, 4™™. Color, in alcohol, yellowish white. 

Taken on the eastern slope of George's Bank, in 220 fathoms, and pre- 
sented by Captain Anderson and crew, of the schooner "Alice G. Wun- 
son." 

PORIPERA. 

Cladorhiza grancfis, sp. nov. 

A large and remarkable species, with a strong, branched root, a long, 
stout, round, unbranched stem, and a very thick, elongated, club-shaped, 
compact body, from which a large number of lateral jirocesses diverge, 
on all sides, nearly at right angles, so as to resemble somewhat an In- 
dian warclub. The lateral processes are long, round, enlarged at base, 
and swollen or clavate toward the end, which terminates in a fascicle of 
Blender setae ; other clusters of setae project from and roughen the sur- 
face of the swollen end. These lateral processes are arranged irregu- 
larly, but rather uniformly, and often appear to form eight to ten or more 
irregular rows, but are more commonly without order, and about half 
an inch apart at base, diverging on all sides, more or less ciu'ved to one 
side or downward, the lowest and the uppermost somewhat shorter; 
their number, on the largest specimens, amounts to a hundred or more, 
while in the smallest observed there are about twenty; they are tubular, 
the small central tube connecting with larger cavities in the body of the 
sponge, at their bases ; the internal cavity is lined with long, slender, 
longitudinal spicula, and their external surface is roughened with small 
projecting spicula, while the surface of the sponge-body is compara- 
tively smooth. A large central bundle of long spicula runs through the 
whole length of the stem and body, and subdivides so as to go into all 
the branches of the root, which subdivides irregularly into numerous 
branches, differing in the different specimens. Color, in alcohol, yel- 
lowish white or clear white. 

Height of largest examples, about 18 inches; diameter of the stem, 0.5 
inch; of body, 1.5 inches; length of lateral processes, 1.5 to 2 inches; 
their diameter in middle, about 0.15 to 0.20 mch. 

A moderate-sized specimen is 220""" high; the root (imperfect) is about

Numei-ons specimens of this very remarkable sponge have been 
brought in by the halibut fishermen from the deep-water fishing grounds 
off IS^ova Scotia, during the past year, and presented to the U. S. Fish 
Commission. Two of the best were taken by Captain McCormick and 
crew, of the schooner "Wachusett," in 180 fathoms, N. lat. 43° 17', W. 
long. 00° 58'. Several specimens have been presented by Capt. J. W.

By G. BR01¥N GOODE and TABLETON H. BEAiV. 

A few days ago Captain William H. Kirby, of Gloucester, Massachu- 
setts, took 500 pounds of a remarkable new fish on a cod-fish trawl in 
lat. 40° N., Ion. 70^ W., at a depth of 84 fathoms, 80 miles south by 
east of Roman's Land. One of these was forwarded by him to the 
United States Xatioual Museum, and forms the type of a new genus and 
species. The single individual secured (jS'o. 22899, Earll 342) is 33 inches 
long. The largest one taken, according to Captain lurby, weighed 50 
pounds. 

The species appears to be generically distinct from the already de- 
scribed species of the family LatiUdcc Gill. It is related by its few-rayed 
vertical fins and other characters to the genus Latilns as restricted by 
Gill, but is distinguished by the presence of a large adii)ose appendage 
upon the nape, resembling the adipose fin of the Salmonidcc, and by a 
fleshy x^rolongation upon each side of the labial fold extending back- 
ward beyond the angle of the mouth. For this genus we propose the 
name LopJiolatilus. 
Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps sp. nov. 

Desceiption.— The greatest height of the body (.300), which is at the 
ventrals, is contained about 3J times in the length to the origin of the 
middle caudal rays, and 4 times in the extreme length. Its greatest 
width (.144) equals the length of the caudal peduncle (.144) ; this latter 
being measured from the end of the soft dorsal to the origin of the mid- 
dle caudal rays. The least height of the tail (.0807) is contained 4 times 
in the distance of the spinous dorsal from the snout. 

The greatest length of the head (.33) is contained 3 times in the length 
to the origin of the middle caudal rays. Its greatest width (.105) is 
slightly more than twice the width of the interorbital area (.08). The 
length of the snout (.122) is contained twice in the length of the pectoral 
of the right side (.244). The length of the operculum to end of flap

(.11) is i of total lengtli. The length of the upper jaw (.15) equals J 
the height of the body at the veutrals, and is contained 2^ times in the 
length of the head. The maxilla extends to the perpendicular through 
the anterior marghi of the orbit ; the mandible does not quite reach the 
perpendicular through the middle of the orbit ; the length of the labial 
appendage is slightly more than half the long diameter of the orbit and 
I the length of the 1st pectoral ray. The length of the mandible (.156) 
shghtly exceeds the distance from the snout to the orbit (.15), and equals 
3 times the long diameter of the eye (.052). ^^hich is contained 6J times 
in the length of the head. The operculum and preoperculum are scaly ; 
the latter is finely denticulated on its posterior margin. The distance 
of the posterior nostril from the eye equals the length of the first anal 
spine ; the distance between the anterior nostril and the end of the 
snout is twice as great. The intermaxillaries are supplied with an outer 
series of about 19 canine teeth, and behind these a band of villiform 
teeth widest at the symphysis. The mandible has a few large canines 
and an inner series of small conical teeth continued from a patch of simi- 
lar teeth at the symphysis ; vomer and palatines toothless. 

The distance of the adipose dorsal from the snout (.200) equals nearly 
3 times its height (.07) ; its length of base (.123) equals the length of 
the snout. The height of the adipose dorsal equals the distance from 
the tip of the ventral to the vent. 

The distance of the spinous dorsal from the snout (.347) equals the 
distance of the ventral from the snout (.347) ; its length of base (.144) 
equals the length of the caudal peduncle. The 1st spine is imperfect— 
what remains of it is ^ as long as the 3d spine (.00). The 2d spine 
(.082) is about equal to the width of the interorbital area. The 4th 
and the 6th spnie are equal in length (.097) and equal the distance from 
the end of the snout to the posterior nostril. The 5th spine (.095) 
is a little shorter than the 6th. The last spine (7th) is contained 10 
times in the total length. The length of the first ray of the soft dorsal 
(.004) equals the distance between the anterior nostril and the end of 
the snout. The 13th, and longest ray (.147), about equals the length of 
the base of the spinous dorsal. The last ray (.07) is half as long as the 
13th. The 13th ray of the soft dorsal extends to the origin of the ex- 
ternal caudal rays. 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.60) is about equal to twice 
the height of the body at the ventrals. The length of the anal base 
(.318) is slightly more than twice the length of the mandible. The 1st 
anal spine (.04) is half as long as the second dorsal spine. The 2d 
anal spine (.075) is half as long as the upper jaw. The 1st ray of the 
anal (.102) is as long as the last spine of the dorsal. The 11th, and 
longest anal ray (.134), is contained 7^ times in the total length, and 
nearly equals the length of the middle caudal rays. The last anal ray 
(.078) is half as long as the mandible. The 11th ray of the anal extends 
almost to the perpendicular through the origin of the middle caudal 
rays. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 207 



The caudal is emarginate, the external rays being only 1^ times as long 
as the middle rays. The length of the superior external rays (.21G), 
measured from the origin of the middle rays, equals li times the length 
of the spinous dorsal base. * 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.32) very slightly exceeds 
the length of the anal base. The length of the pectoral of the right 
side (.244) equals twice that of the snout. The pectoral of the left side 
is probably imi)erfect; its length (.210) being equal to that of the supe- 
rior external caudal rays. The right pectoral can be made to reach the 
vent ; in its natural position it extends to the perpendicular let fall from 
the 4th ray of the 2d dorsal. 

The distance of the ventral from the snout (.347) equals 4 times the 
least height of the tail. The length of the ventral (.183) equals twice 
that of the 3d dorsal spine, and it extends to a point under the third 
dorsal ray. The distance from the tip of the ventral to the vent equals 
half the length of the middle caudal rays. The vent is under the inter- 
val between the fourth and fifth dorsal rays.

I, 5; L. Lat. 93; L. Trans. 8+30. 

Color. — The operculum, preoperculum, upper surface of head, and ma- 
jor portion of the body, have numerous greenish-yellow spots, the largest 
of which are about ^ as long as the eye. Upon the caudal rays are about 
eight stripes of the same color, some of them connected by cross blotches. 
The upper part of the body has a violaceous tint, and the lower parts are 
^vhitish, with some areas of yellow. The anal and ventral fins are 
whitish. The pectorals have the tint of the upper surface of the body, 
with some yellow upon their posterior surfaces. The soft dorsal has an 
upper broad band of violaceous, and a narrow basal portion of whitish. 
Many of the rays have upon them a yellow stripe; there are some spots 
of the same color, especially upon the anterior portion of the fin. 

Note. — In the table of measurements, the unit of comparison is the 
length to the origin of the middle caudal rays.

Capt. William Dempsey, of Gloucester, lias since fiirnislied nine fresh 
specimens of this LopholatUus and the following information: 

" Tbe fish were caught with Menhaden bait in July, 1879, while ' try- 
ing' for cod 50 miles south by east of Neman's Land, in hit. 40° 10' K, 
Ion. 70° 55' W., 75 fathoms, on very hard clay bottom. Two miles inside 
of this bottom there is nothing but a green ooze, on which no fish will live. 

" Two of the 9 fish were spent females. The few remaining eggs of 
these 2 were not so large as those of the herring, and resemble the eggs 
of the Norway Haddock. The other 7 had nothing to determine whether 
they were male or female. 

"The liver is small, somewhat like that of the mackerel, and contains 
no oil. The flesh is oily and will soon rust after splitting and drying. 

" The stomach and intestines are small, the latter resembling those of 
an eel. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 209 

" The swiin-bladder is similar to that of a cod. 
"Some of the fish 'blister' like cusk when taken on deck." 
" They were very abundant and bit freely." 

The largest of the individuals brought in by Captain Dempsey has a 
bifid nuchal crest.

ON THE 0€CUBRK1VCE OF liYCOOES VAHIill, KEIJVHABDT, ON I.A 
HAVE AND ORAND OANK!^. 

By O. BROWIV <j;OOI>i: and TAKL.ETON H. BEA]\. 

The United States Fish Commission has received from Captain Z. Haw- 
kins and the crew of the schooner " Gwendolen," of Gloucester, Mass., 
a fine specimen of a species of Lycodes, obtained on La Have Bank in 
latitude 42° 43' north and between the meridians of 02° 20' and ()o° 30' 
west, at the depth of 300 to 400 fathoms, the schooner having changed 
position while fishing. A second specimen, 632 millimetres in length, 
was presented by Captain Wm. H. Greenleaf and the crew of the 
schooner " Chester R. Lawrence," who secured it on the Grand Banks. 
After a careful comparison of this species with that described by Rein- 
hardt under the name Lycodes Vahlii* and previously recorded only 
from Greenland, we are &iclined to believe the two identical. 

Reinhardt's description of Lycodes Valilii is very full, and is supple- 
mented by a long table of measurements, which has been very service- 
able in the study of the specimens before us. 

The dentition of the La Have specimen agrees exactly with that of 
L. Verrillii. The lower jaw has the teeth in two series, with an imper- 
fect series of smaller ones between. The upper jaw has a single series 
of teeth, with a few smaller ones behind the symphysis. There are 
about seven teeth on tlie vomer and a single row of about seven on each 
palatine. The teeth are obtuse-conic, not curved as m. L^ YerriUiL 
In the specimen of L. Valilii from La Have, the colors are somewhat 
less regular in distribution than those described and figured !by Rein- 
liardt ; instead of showing six light bands, the arrangement, of light 
color upon the dark ground of the body is as follows : one white spot 
on each side, above the posterior end of the opercular flap, the spots 
not meeting on the dorsal line. The first saddle-shaped marldng begins 
on the back, under the 8th ray of the dorsal fin, and extends on either 
side nearly to the middle of the body. The second isaddle-shaped mark- 
ing begins under the 27th dorsal ray and extends nearly to the; margin 
of the fin, involving the width of about two rays and 4:he connecting 
membrane, and extends also downward nearly to the middle line of tlie 
1 >ody , increasing in width as it descends. The next begins under the 
.■)4th ray, and resembles the last in form and extent. The next begins 
under the 79th, and, though smaller, resembles the others. The individ-

l>ESCKIPTIO:V OF A IVEW FI^iH FROITI Ar,A.SKA (AIVARRHK IIA$« 

t.EE»TBJKi;S>, WBTSI NOTES lH»OIV OTHER SPECIES OF THE 
OEIVUS AI>rARRHI€HAS. 

By TARLETON H. BEAN. 

The United States National Museum lias received from Mr. Lucieii M. 
Turner a species of Aiiarrhichas, wliich I at first hoped would prove to 
be the orientaUs of Pallas.* It differs, however, widely from the de- 
scription of that species, and does not correspond with any other known 
to me. 

Two specimens of the Alaskan Anarrhichas were secured at St. 
Michael's in 187G. These are the first and only representatives of the 
genus from the Pacific in the Museum collection. 

One of them,:N^o. 21509, is GOO millimetres long; the other, No. 21510, 
is 495 millimetres. The lengths to the origin of the middle caudal rays 
are 555 and 455 respectively, and with these all the other measurements 
are compared. 

Description. — The greatest height of the body (.20) is contained 5 
times in the unit of length, and equals the distance of the dorsal from 
the end of the snout (.20). Its height at the pectorals (.17^) is contained 
3 times in the distance of the anal from the snout (.52.^). The least 
height of the tail (.04i) is contained twice in tlie length of the middle 
caudal rays (.09). 

The greatest length of the head (.24) equals 1 J times its greatest height 
(.10), and is contained in the unit of length 4 times. The distance from 
the nostril to the anterior margin of the orbit (.015) is contained 3 times 
in the distance between the eyes (.045). The greatest width of the head 
(.11) is a little less than half its length, and is contained 9 times in the 
unit of length. The width of the interorbital area (.045) is about equal 
to the length of the snout (.04-.045). The length of the upper jaw (.13) 
equals 3 times the width of the interorbital area, and a little more than 
one-half of the length of the head. The maxillary extends to the per- 
pendicular through the middle of the length of the head, the angle of 
the mouth being equally distant from the end of the snout and the end 
of the opercular flap. 

The length of the mandil>ie (.145) nearly equals that of the pectoral 
(.15), and is contained 7 times in the unit of length. The mandible ex- 
tends to a point about equally distant from the end of the snout and the 
origin of the dorsal. There are four large canines in the upper jaw and 
five in the k)wer, all of them strongly recurved. Behind the canines in 
each jaw are a few short, sharp, conical teeth, also recurved. The pala- 
tines are in two rows, 4 teeth in the outer and 5 in the inner series. The 
teeth of the outer series are much the longer. Vomerine teeth ten, in 
two series. The vomerine patch begins in advance of the palatines, and 
*Zoi3g. Eosso-Asiatica, iii, 1831, p. 77. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 213 

extends farther back than the latter. The length of the palatine series 
is to that of the vomerine as 16 to 27. 

The distance from the snout to the orbit (.05 -.055) is contained, 
nearly or quite 4 times in that from the snout to the origin of the dorsaL 
The long diameter of the eye (.035) equals one-seventh, or slightly more 
than one-seventh, of the length of the head, and not quite one-fourth of 
the length of the lower jaw. 

The distance between the end of the snout and the origin of the dorsal 
(.20) is contained 5 times in the unit of length, and equals twice the 
length of the longest dorsal ray (.10). 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.52) equals 3 times the 
height of the body at the pectorals. The length of the first anal ray 
(.035) equals the long diameter of tlie eye (.035). The longest anal ray 
(.05 -.055) equals a little less than half of the width of the body, and 
less than one-fourth of the length of the head. The vent is about mid- 
way between the end of the snout and that of the dorsal, and under the 
25th to the 27th dorsal rays. 

The length of the middle caudal rays (.085) is contained twice in the 
height of the body at the pectorals, and equals twice the least height of 
the tail. The caudal is rounded. 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.23) is contained 4=^ times 
in the unit of length, and the length of the pectoral (.15) is contained 
6| times. The extended pectoral reaches to the perpendicular through 
the origin of the ICvh dorsal ray. 

Badial formula: D. 81; A. 50-53; C. 20-21; P. 21. 

Scales : Head and fins scaleless. The median line of the body and the 
whole of the tail are covered with small widely-separated scales, resem- 
bling those of Lota, but not depressed. 

Color: The prevailing color of the alcoholic specimens is dark brown, 
without bands and spots. The belly is light brown or gray, clouded 
with very dark brown. 

Anarrhichas lepturus needs to be contrasted only with. A. or ientalis 
and A. lupus. It seems to me improbable that any species of Anarrhi- 
chas can be safely identified with orientalis. The description of that 
species is certainly insufficient, and may be erroneous. The total length, 
for example, is stated to be 2 feet 2 inches, English measure ; the length 
of the head, 1 L inches — a proportion whi(;h is without a parallel in the 
other species of the genus. Assuming that the length of the head is not 
correctly given, and that it bears the same proportion to the total length 
as that of A. lepturus, it still differs from the latter in (1) the absence of 
scales, (2) the situation of the nostril midway between the eye and the 
mouth, (3) its radial formula — D. 84; C. 17 — (4) the presence of 6 ca- 
nines in the upper jaw. We must, however, accept the descrii)tion as 
it stands, for the measurements are evidently those intended by the 
author, in which event the length of the head alone will serve to dis- 
tinguish orientalis from all other species. 



214 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

A. Jepturus is distinguished from A. lupus by (1) its uniform brown 
color, (2) its scanty squamation, (3) its slender tail, (4) its greater num- 
ber of dorsal and anal rays. It resembles A. Inims in many respects, 
but differs from it as widely as lupus does from latifrons. 

In the measurement tables which follow the hundredths of length are 
calculated from the total length without the caudal. 

A key to the species of Anarrliiclias is given. In this no reference is 
made to the denticulatus of Kroyer, because the slight descriptions 
which we have of this species do not serve to distinguish it from 
latifrons. The species known on the American coast as A. latifrons is 
evidently the latifrons of Steenstrup* & Collett,t and I cannot see that 
it diflers from the denticxilatus of Giinthert or of Ivroyer.§

NOTK!^ ON CERTAIN TYPICAI. SPECIMENS OF AMERICAN FISHES 
IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND IN THE MUSEUM D'HISTOIRE 
NATUREU.I.E AT PARIS. 

By DAVID S. JORDAIV, Ifl. D. 

In a recent visit to Europe the writer has bad the privilege of exam- 
ining the original types of certain species of American fishes, described 

* Anarrhichas latifrons and A. denticulatus are made the type of a distinct subgenus by Professor 
Gill, who inoposes to separjito these from tho lupus type by the following characters : The greater 
convexity and longitudinal arching of the skull at the posterior frontal region, and the much greater 
extension backwards of tho palatine series of teeth as compared with the vomerine band. Examina- 
tion of the large collection of the three Atlantic species of Anarrhichas in the National Museum has 
convinced me that these characters have not the taxonomic value claimed for them, owing to their great 
variability in individxtals. The flgurea published by Steenstrup (Vid. Medd. naturh. For. K.job., 1876, 
tab. iii) represent extremes of A. minor and A. latifrons, which, without access to many examples of 
both species, would bo misleading. A. minor, for instance, sometimes has the vomerine band of teeth 
extending little farther back than is observed in A. latifrons. The dentition of A. latifrons, too, is sub- 
ject to considerable variation with age, as is the shape of the skull. A. minor seems to show closer 
aflBnity to A. latifrons than to A. lupus.

by Dr. Albert Giinther from specimens in the British Museum, and by 
Cuvier, Valenciennes, and others from examples in the Museum at Paris. 
Notes on some of these, the proper identification of which may affect 
our nomenclature, are here presented. 

1. Micropterus dolomieu Lacepede. 

Lae6pede, Histoire Naturelle ties Poissons iv, 324. 

The original type of this species is a large specimen, still in good con- 
dition. Its peculiarity, which led to its separation from "irtftrifs" by 
Lacepede, is that the last rays of the dorsal are detached from the others, 
and somewhat distorted, the result of some accident to the fish while 
young. The injury to the specimen is therefore not a museum mutila- 
tion, as I had heretofore understood, but a healed wound. This speci- 
men belongs to the southern variety of the small-mouthed Black Bass, 
recognized by me (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., xii, 1878, p. 30) as Micropterus 
salmoides var. salmoides. Prof. Yaillant recognizes this form provision- 
ally (MSS. Mission Scientifique au Mexique) as a distinct species {Mi- 
cropterus dolomieu Lac.) from the northern form, but the differences seem 
to me to have no more than varietal value. 

As shown below, there is little doubt that the specific name dolomieu, 
is the first ever distinctly api^lied to our small-mouthed Black Bass, as 
the name Micropterus is its earliest generic appellation. Unless we adopt 
the earlier salmoides, its name should, therefore, be Micropterus dolomieu. 

On the other hand it is true that the name Micropterus dolomieu was 
applied to a deformed specimen, which was considered as a distinct 
genus and species solely on account of its deformity. 

It is an established rule of nomenclature (Dall, Eept. Comm. Zool. 
Nomenc, 48,) that " a name shoidd be rejected * * * when it ex- 
presses an attribute or character positively false in the majority or the 
whole of the group in question, as in cases (among others) when a name 
has been founded on a monstrous, abnormal, immature, artificial, or 
mutilated specimen." 

The name Micropterus was founded on a monstrous specimen; in the 
sense intended by its author it expresses a false character, although the 
species really have smaller fins than are found in related genera. In 
the opinion of some writers it should be set aside and the next name in 
order {CalUurus Eaf.) should be adopted in its stead. The species might 
then stand as CalUurus dolomieu. The specific name " dolomieu " is also 
open to objection, as it is a French noun having neither a Latin nor a 
genitive form, but being an unmodified name of a person. Tbis hardly 
seems to me a reason for rejecting the name, although, if retained, it 
should receive a genitive form, as dolomii, or dolomiei. 

The question of the adoption of the name Micropterus is still an open 
one. The weight of authority is, however, at j)resent in fiivor of its 
retention, and the writer sees no suflQcient reason for setting it aside.

Grystes mlmoides Cav. & Val., Hist. Nat. de.s Poiss. Ill, 54, pi. 46. 

It seems rather a thankless task to reopen the question of the proper 
nomendature of the Black Bass, hut it is evident that we have not yet 
reached the bottom. The name Micropterus salmoides is now generally 
adopted in America as the proper name of the small-mouthed Black Bass, 
not only among naturalists, but among anglers and sportsmen as well. 
In the Museum at Paris, however, the same name is fully adopted for 
the large-mouthed Black Bass. Let us inquire into the history of the 
use of the name salmoides. 

In 1800, the name Lahrus salmoides was given by Lacepede to a fish 
inhabiting the waters of Carolina, and known to Americans as "Trout."' 
This fish was known to Lacepede only through a drawing and manu- 
script description by Bosc. Both species of Black Bass occur in Caro- 
lina, the large-mouth most abundantly. Neither drawing nor descrip- 
tion is exact enough to enable us to tell with certainty, or even with 
reasonable probability, which species was meant by Bosc and Lacepede. 
It is unlikely that Bosc discriminated between them at all, both being- 
alike "Trout" to the Carolina fishermen. In the figure the mouth is 
drawn large, and if we mi(sf choose, the large-mouth is best represented. 

The specific name salmoides next appears in the great work of Cu- 
vier & Yalenciennes (III, p. 54) as Grystes salmoides. The description 
here given is for the most part applicable to both species ; the small size 
of the scales (" il y en a quatre-viugt-dix sur une ligne longitudinale et 
trente-six on quarante sur une verticale" *) and the naked preopercuhnn 
render it evident that at least that part of the description was taken 
from a small-mouth, while the accomjianyiug figure more resembles the 
large-mouth. 

We are, however, not here left in doubt. The original material of the 
French naturalists is still preserved in the museum. It consists of the 
following specimens as described by Cuvier and Valenciennes : 

1. " I^ousavons re^u, par M. Milbert, un individu de huit a neuf pouces 
et un de six a sept. C'est ce deniier qui a six rayons a la membrane des 
ouies et quatorze rayons mous a la dorsale." 

From one of these specimens the figure in the Histoire Naturelle des 
Poissons (pi. 4G) was taken.t This specimen is unquestionably a large- 
mouthed Black Bass. 

2. " Plus tard, M. Lesueur nous en a envoyd de la riviere Wabash un 
individu long de seize pouces, et trois autres qui n'en out guere que cinq. 
Les jeunes sont d'un vert plus pale, et out sur chaque flanc vingt-cinq a 
trente lignes longitudinales et paralleles brunes, qui paraissent s'effacer 
avec Page." 

These specimens are still preserved, bearing the MSS. name of Ciehla 
variabilis Le Sueur, and belong to the small-iliouthed species. This

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 221 

name, which, so far as I know, was never published by Le Sueur, is thus 
noticed by Cuvier and Valenciennes: 

"• M. Lesueur, croyant I'espece nouvelle, en a public une description 
dans le Journal des sciences a Philadelphie, sous le nom de cichla vari- 
abilis ; niais nous avous tout lien de croire que c'est ce poisson qui est 
represents et decrit par M. de Lacepede (t. iv, p. 71G et 717, et pi. 5, fig. 
2), sous le nom de lahre salmoide, d'apres des notes et une figure four- 
uies par M, Bosc qui le nommait j^erca trutte. La figure en est un peu 
rude, mais la description s'accorde avec ce que nous avons vu, sauf 
quelques details, qui tienuent pent-etre moins an poisson meme qu'a la 
maniere dont il a 6t6 observe." 

Later (vol. v, p. v), the type of Micropterus dolomieu was re-examined 
and fully identified by Cuvier as a Grystes salmoides. 

It is thus evident that Cuvier and Valenciennes completely confounded 
the two species under the name Grystes sahnoides, and that the uncer- 
tain salmoides of Lacepede became in their hands a complex species. 
We may perhaps say that their salmoides must be the fish described by 
them, and that the figure is to be taken into consideration only when 
other evidence is wanting. M. Vaillant, however, maintains that the 
large-mouthed species should be considered as the salmoides of Cuvier 
and Valenciennes, inasmuch as one of that species served as the type of 
their published figure. 

The next writers who use the name salmoides (De Kay, Storer, etc.), 
have merely copied or echoed the description of Cuvier and Valen- 
' ciennes, and have in no way given precision to the name. 

Later Agassiz uses the name ^^ salmoneus''^ (slip of the pen for "saZ- 
■moi<7es"?) apparently referring to the large-mouthed species. 

The description given by Dr. Giinther of Grystes salmoides in the Cat- 
alogue of the Fishes of the British Museum, I, 252, adds nothing to the 
precision of our knowledge of the species, the characters given being either 
taken from Cuvier and Valenciennes, or else common to both species. 

Next a description is given of Grystes salmoides by Holbrook (Ich. S. 
Car., p. 28, pi. 4, f. 2), accompanied by an excellent figure, which leaves no 
possible doubtof the species intended. This is the large-mouthed Bass. 

Omitting ])apers of lesser importance, we come finally to the very able 
discussion of these questions by Professor Gill (Proc. Am. Ass. Adv. 
Sci., 1873, p. 55-72), iu which the whole subject is exhaustively treated, 
and the name Micropterus salmoides is definitely adopted for the small- 
mouthed Black Bass. This arrangement has been followed by most 
recent ichthyologists. In an important paper just now passing through 
the press (Mission Scientifique an Mexique), however, Messrs. Vaillant 
and Bocourt liaA^e adopted the name Micropterus salmoides for the large- 
mouthed species, for the reasons indicated above. 

This question resolves itself into two. Is the specific name salmoides 
available for either species! and if so, for which? 
Between the publication of the works of Lacepede and Cuvier both 



222 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

species had been more than once described under different names by 
Eaflnesqne and Le Sueur. Of these names, Lepomis palUdus Eaf. for 
the large-mouthed BLick Bass, Micropenis dolomieu Lac. for the south- 
ern, and Bodianns achk/an Eaf. for the northern variety of the small- 
mouth have priority over the others. All these, therefore, antedate any 
precise definition of the name sahnoides. 

The question as to wliether a specific name, at first loosely applied 
and afterwards precisely fixed, shall claim priority from its first use or 
not, has been differently answered by different writers, and has perhaps 
never been settled by general usage. I suppose that the amount of 
doubt or confusion arising from its use or rejection enters with most 
writers as an element. The name sahnoides, left unsettled by Lacepede, 
has been generally received by writers, in consequence of the supposed 
precision given to it by Cuvier. We have seen, however, that both 
species were included by Cuvier under one name, and that we must look 
farther for real restriction of the species. The first distinct use of the 
name sahnoides for any particular species is by Holbrook, for the large- 
mouthed form. On the basis of the first unquestionable restriction, the 
name, if used at all, must be applied to that species. Forty years pre- 
vious to this restriction, however, the specific name j^a?ZiV7?fs was conferred 
on the same fish by Eafinesque. 

In the writings of nearly all the older naturalists, as well as in many 
of the later ones, we find descriptions of species which are really 
generic in theu" value, and which, as our knowledge of species becomes 
greater, cannot be disposed of with certainty or even with any high 
degree of probability, for absolute certainty rarely accompanies any 
identification. 

In the absence or impossibility of any general rule regarding such 
cases, the following supposed examples will illustrate what seems to the 
present writer a fair method of treating them. 

Let us suppose that the genus Micropferus contains two well-marked 
species; that to one of these the name sahnoides was early applied; that 
next the names dolomiei and paUidus were applied to the two respect- 
ively, and that subsequently the name salmoides was restricted to the one 
called paUidus. 

Now if (1) the original sahnoides were definitely a complex species, 
distinctly including both, we may hold its author to be a " conservative" 
writer, and that the subsequent restriction, like the restriction of a 
genus, is a change of view or the elimination of an error. In this case, 
the name sahnoides should be retained, dating its priority from its orig- 
inal use, and applying to the species palUdus. 

If (2) the original sahnoides be not complex, but simply uncertain, tlie 
probabilities being undeniably in favor of its identity with paUidus 
rather than with dolomiei, itshouldbe adopted instead of j7rt//</7/^s^ Abso- 
lute cprtaiuty of identification cannot be expected of many names older 
than the present generation, and eacli writer must judge for himself of 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 223 

the degrees of probability. If we may express it numerically, a proba- 
bility of 75 per cent, should perhaps be sufiicient, and this probability 
should be unquestionable— that is, not merely subjective and varying 
with the mental differences of the different writers. 

If (3) the original salmoideshe evidently a Mcroj^fena, but hopelessly 
uncertain as to the species intended, it should claim priority from its 
first use for a definite species of Micropterus. If the name pallidus 
intervene between its first use and its final precise use, salmoides should 
become a synonym oiimUidus. and should not be available for the other 
species. This rule is followed more or less consistently by most writers, 
and it seems to me a fair one. The revival of hopelessly uncertain 
ancient specific names in place of well-defined modern ones is productive 
only of confusion, and is open to gross abuse. The revival even of well- 
defined but forgotten names is confusing enough, and it has been 
strongly objected to by many writers. 

If (4) the name salmoides^ left hopelessly uncertain by its author, 
should have been definitely used for some species to which it might not 
improbably have referred hefore the use of the name pallidus for the 
same species, it should be retained, dating its acceptance from its sec- 
ond use, and the name pallidus should be considered as a synonym of 
salmoides. 

If (5) the name salmoides should have been adopted by the second 
author supposed in (4) for some species not a Micropterus ^ or for some 
species which could not reasonably be identical with the original sal- 
moides^ the identification should be taken as an erroneous one, and should 
not be considered in our nomenclature. 

The actual state of the name salmoides is that supposed under (3) above. 
I do not consider the name salmoides as rightfully entitled to priority over 
either pallidus or dolomiei as the specific name of a species of Black 
Bass. If it must be used, however, I think it wisest to retain it, with 
Professor Gill, for the small-mouthed species. For this purpose, we 
must consider the salmoides of Lacepede as complex, including both 
species. The case would then be that supposed by (1) above. We must 
hold further that Cuvier and Yalencieunes restricted the name to the 
small-mouthed form. No possible settlement of the case can be free from 
question or objection. I propose to adopt the following ^4ew of the case, 
l^roposed by Dr. Gill (in lit.), to whom I have submitted the evidence 
above given. 

Dr. Gill remarks : 

" I think we can retain our old names (i. e. Micropterus salmoides and 
Micropterus pallidus) on the following grounds: 

"(1) Let us admit that Lahrus salmoides Lac. may he the small- 
mouthed. 

'•'■ (2) The name salmoides, it may be considered, was re-established by 
Cuvier and Valenciennes for the largest specimen (the small-mouthed, 
according to your observations). The description was evidently based 



224 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

on that, as appears from the number of scales, the absence of any on the 
preopercular limb ("le limbe de son preopercule fete] en manqueut"),. 
and the form of the dorsal. Even if it is certain that the iigure was 
taken from a large-mouthed specimen, this would not affect the question, 
inasmuch as we must accept the description when that is definitive, and 
such is the case here. 

"(3) It may be held that tlie name is farther specialized by Cuvier 
and Valenciennes by its use to supersede the name of Le Sueur (p. 55), 
and as a substitute for M. Dolomieu (vol. v, p. 5). 

"(4) The majority of the C. & V.'s specimens belonged to the small- 
mouthed Bass. 

"(5) The figure was based on a large-mouth simply through accidence 
of size and condition, not selected on account of exhibition of characters. 
In the same way, we might maintain that the type of Pomotis vulgaris 
C. & V. (although the descrii^tion plainly points to Eupomotis aureus) 
was Lepomis palUdus [rather auritm]^ for the figure apparently repre- 
sents such."

A specimen collected by Le Sueur at Philadelphia, and doubtless the

one of these the figure of the species was apparently' taken. 

5. Bryttus puuctatus Cuvier & Valenciennes. 

Hist. Nat. des Poiss. vii, 462. 
Tlie types of this species (Charleston, Holbrook Coll.) belong to the

Philos. Soc, 1877) and by me as Lepiopomus apiatus (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus.

This species is the Pomotis speciosus of Holbrook, Pomotis microlophus

terus nigrofasciatns Agassiz. 

13. Eesox deprandus Le Sueur. 

(Le Sueur MSS., Cuv. & Val. Hist. Nat. des Poiss. xviii, 336.) 
The type of this species, a large stuifed shin, is an ordinary Esox 
luciiis L. The cheeks, as usual, are scaly ; the opercles naked below. 

14. Leuciscus gardoneus Cuv. & Val. 

(Hist. Nat. des Poiss. xvii, 316 ; Giinther Cat. Fishes Brit. Mus. vii, 258. 
Ckondrostoma gardoneum Cope, Trans. Am. Phil. Soc. 1866,393.) 
The single typical specimen of this species agrees with Noteniigonus 
clirysoleueus in most respects, differing chiefly in the short anal (9 or 10 
developed rays). It must be referred to the genus Noteniigonus, of 
which it possesses the carinated abdomen, backward dorsal, and the 
teeth 5-5, the edges of the grinding surftice strongly crenate. If the 
specimen is normal, not an accident or hybrid, the species should stand 
as N'otemigonus gardoneus. Professor Cope's statement, that the type 
of this species (also examined by him in Paris) is " identical with Chon 
drostoma in dentition and other characters," is not reconcilable with 
my ideas of the genus Ckondrostoma. 

15. Leuciscus spirlingulus Cuv. & Val.

The types are small specimens of Luxilus cornutus (Mitch.).

The type of this species, as already supposed by me (Man. Vert. E. U.

226 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

therefore stand as EhinicMhys cataracta'. The teeth of the typical speci- 
men have never been exaniined. The difference in the dentition oi Gobio 
and EJiinichthys does not therefore aft'ect the correctness of this identi- 
fication. 

17. Leuciscus boucardi Giiuther. 

Cat. Fishes Brit. Mus. vii, 485. 

The teeth of this species have a very narrow grinding surface. It is 
tlierefore probably referable to the genus Myloleucus as understood by 



18. Ceraticlithys sallasi GUuther. 

Cat. Fishos Urit. Mus. vii, 484. 

As this species has no bnrbels, the propriety of its reference to 
Ceraticlithys is not evident. It has the teeth 4-4 with grinding surface, 
and is therefore referable to the genus Hudsonius {Ryhopsis Cope) as now 
understood by nie. 

19. Ceicitichthys cumingi Giiiitber. 

Cat. Fishes Brit. Mus. vii, 177 

This species is a true Ceraticlithys^ evidently closely related to C. 
amhlops. It perhaps was not taken in California. 

20. Graodus nigrotaeniatus Giiuthcr. 

Cat. Fishes Brit. Mus. vii, 485. 

There are three typical examples of this species. The teeth of two of 
them were examined by Dr. Giinther, and liave, as stated by their de- 
scriber, "i)haryngeal teeth quite rudimental replaced by a somewhat 
uneven ridge of the bone." The third specimen, however, proved on 
examination to have developed teeth, of the ordinary sort, two on each 
side. Traces of the roots of similar teeth were visible on the other 
specimens, but in none were any evidences of the existence of a greater 
number. It is, therefore, possible that the normal number is 2-2. It 
is my opinion, however, that the teeth are normally 4-4, and that in 
these examples they have been lost, either by natural shedding or 
tlirougli the softening due to long preservation in spirits. If this view 
is correct, the genus Graodus should be suppressed. As the teeth are 
without grinding surface, the species should be referred to the genus 
Cliola, as understood by me, and should stand as Cliola niyrotmniata. 
If the teeth are normally 2-2, the genus Graodus should be retained. 

Tlie writer wishes to express his obligations to Dr. Giinther for the

FCSBIEKIES. 

Series I. 

[Distributed in fifty sets, put up by Mr. Eicliard Ratlibuu, under tlie direction of 
Professor A. E. Verrill, 1879.] 

EXPLANATION. 

The specimens included in the following list are preserved in alcohol, 
anless otherwise stated. The authority given for the name is usually 
the author who first used the comUned binomial name herein adopted, 
and is not necessarily that of the author who first described the species, 
or gave the siJecific name. (A name in parentheses is authority for the 
specific name only.) 

The species are not all included in each of the fifty sets, but those 
sent in each numbered set are checked on the list bearing the correspond- 
ing number. The species now distributed are not to be considered as 
tlie most common, but simply those which happen to be at present most 
abundantly represented in the collections of the Fish Commission, or 
those which, for other reasons, can be most conveniently distributed at 
this time, and have been so selected as to give representatives of most 
of the important groups. It will also be understood that the species 
included in this list form but a very small proportion (less than one- 
twelfth) of the total number of species contained in the collections made 
by the Fish Commission on the New England coast.

Upon tlie coast of Europe au Amphipod belouging- to tlie genus Ghc- 
liira has long been known, associated with the Isopod Limnoria ligno- 
nim, or " gribble" of English writers, in destroying the timber of all 
kinds of submarine structures. But, upon the coast of the United States, 
the Chclura has apparently escaped detection until very recently, and I

am not aware of any published notice of its occurrence, althougli Lim- 
noria lias been known for many years, and its ravages bave often at- 
tracted attention. I have repeatedly made careful search for Chelura at 
many different points upon our eastern coast from New Jersey to i^ova 
Scotia, and have examined many pieces of Teredo- and Limnoria-hored 
timber from other parts of the coast, but, until 1875, I was not able to 
discover an individual of the genus. In the summer of that year, while 
connected with the party of the United States Fish Commission at Woods 
Holl, ]Massachusetts, two small specimens of Chelura were discovered, 
associated with Limnoria, in a bit of wood scraped from one of the piles 
of the government wharf. A careful search was made upon the piles of 
several wharves in the neighborhood and among the government store 
of spar buoys, but no more specimens could be discovered, although 
Limnoria was found in abundance. 




Figure 1. 



-Chelura terebrans ; male ; lateral view, enlarged about 
twelve diameters. 



Without European specimens for comparison, these two individuals 
were scarcely sufficient to establish the identity of our species with the 
common species of Europe ; and I delayed calling attention to tlie subject 
until more material should be discovered. Xo other specimens came to 
hand until August of the present year, when Professor 
Verrill discovered the species in abundance in old 
submerged piles at Provincetown, Massachusetts. 
Tiie specimens found by Professor Verrill were all in 
wood submerged from 8 to 12 feet below the surface 
at low water, and were associated with Limnoria 
lignorum and Teredo navalis. The Limnoria occurred 
only sparingly, however, in this case, though it was 
found, by Mr. Sanderson Smith, in great abundance, 
with Teredo navalis, but without Chelura, in water- 
logged wood dredged the past summer in Cape Cod 
Bay in 7^ fathoms. The si5ecimens obtained by Pro- 
fessor Verrill exhibit all the variations due to age and 
sex, and show plainly that our s])ecies is identical 
with the European Chelura terebrans. 

The species was first brought to notice by Philippi, 
who discovered it at Trieste, in company with Teredo 
navalis, in planks just taken from the sea, and who described and figured

it in 1839. It was more fully described and figured by AUman, in 1847, 
from specimeus found in the piles of the jetty in tlie harbor of Kingstown, 
near Dublin, Ireland. It has since been noticed at various points on the 
coast of Europe from Southern Norway to the Adriatic, and attention 
has often been called to its ravages. 

There is ai^parently but one sjiecies of the genus known. The (7. pon- 
tica, described by Czerniavski, in 18G8, judging from the figures and the 
Latin part of the description, is not distinct. The figure which he gives 
of one of the abdominal swimming legs (pleopods) shows only one multi- 
articulate ramus, which is an evident inaccuracy in the drawing, and 
some other slight difi'erences shown in the figures are apparently due to 
a similar cause. It is perhaps well to mention, in connection Mith this 
reference to Czerniavski's paper, a very remarkable paper published the 
same year by Eugene Hesse, in which this well-known European species 
is redescribed and extensively figured, from specimens taken on the 
coast of France, as a new species of Lhnnoria ! The geuus Chelurauu- 
questionably belongs to the Amphipo<la, and has been placed in that 
order and near CorojjMmn hy all carcinologists who have written upon 
the subject. It has, in fact, no structural features which ally it to the 
Isopoda, as distinguished from the Amphipoda, aud it has no external 
resemblance to Limnoria, with which it need not be confounded by the 
most superficial observer. 

The Chehira is readily distinguished from all the known genera of 
crustaceans by the structure of the three pairs of caudal stylets (uro- 
potls). The first (antepenultimate) pair of these appendages are slender 
and tipped with two small and nearly ecpial rami ; the second have the 
dorsal edge of the basal portion expanded into a thin, broad, oval plate 
projecting beyond the two small rami Avhich are attached in an emargina- 
tion of the lower margin ; the last pair have very stout but short bases, 
to each of which is articulated a single very long and strong ramus, 
which, in fully grown males, is nearly asloug as the body of the animal, 
but much shorter in females and young. The length of fully grown 
male, from the front of the head to the ultimate pair of caudal stxiets, 
is about a quarter of an inch (G™'"); that of the female somewhat less. 

According to notes, made upon the specimeus taken at Wood's HoU 
in 1875, the color of Chehira is very different from that of Limnoria, 
being semitranslucent, thickly spotted and mottled above with pink, 
somewhat as in UncioJa irrorata, but wanting the opaque white of that 
species.

By DAVID S. J1>RDAM. 

1. BOLEOSOMA VEXILLARE, Sp. IIOV. 

Allied to Boleosoma cffnlgens. Body rather short and stout ; caudal 
peduncle not contracted; head moderate, the muzzle somewhat de- 
curved ; eye moderate ; gill membranes scarcely connected ; cheeks and 
breast naked; opercles scaly; a naked strip in front of the dorsal fin; 
opercular spine moderately developed ; second dorsal very short and high, 
higher than long ; x)ectorals and ventrals not reaching to anal. 

Coloration olivaceous, the sides with traces of vertical bars, probably 
greenish in life ; male with the first dorsal, ventral, and anal black ; sec- 
ond dorsal and caudal strongly barred with black and white in fine 
pattern; head black; female not seen, but probably without black. 
Lateral line complete. Scales very large, 4-35-6. 

Head 4 in length to base of caudal ; depth 4|. 

Fin rays. Dorsal VIII-10; A. I., 7. 

Length of type 2^ inches. 

This species differs from its relatives in the larger scales and the much 
shorter and higher second dorsal. (D. IX-13 in B. effulgem.) 

The type was taken in the Eappahannock Eiver at Warrentou. Va., 
by a correspondent of "Forest and Stream," and forwarded to me for 
identification by the editor of that journal, Mr. Charles Hallock, 



236 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

2. iSTANOSTOMA VmCTiPES, Sp. IIOV. 

Allied to ytoiostoma zonule {Poecilichthys zoiudis, Cope). Body fusi- 
form, little compressed; head short, the suout strongly decurved ; eye 

3 in head ; mouth small, horizontal, the 
I, not distinguishable on the vomer and 
palatines ; cheeks, opercles, neck, and throat closely scaled ; opercular 
spine well developed 5 gill membranes broadly connected across the 
breast. 

First dorsal rather low, with slender spines ; second dorsal shorter 
and rather higher; the two well separated. Anal si^ines high, the first 
much the higher. Caudal moderate, subtruncate. Ventrals pointed, 
not reaching to the vent. Pectorals moderate, reaching rather beyond 
tips of ventrals. 

Lateral line comjilete, with 45 scales in its course. 

Color olivaceous, with about 8 obscure darker lateral shades or bars, 
with narrow paler interspaces. These bars meet around the body be- 
hind the vent, but not anteriorly ; back with G darker quadrate shades. 
A dark streak downward and forward from eye, and some black mark- 
ings in front of opercle. Fins all strongly cross-barred with darker, 
the pectorals and ventrals especially so; spinous dorsal reddish at base, 
with a blackish edging. 

Fin rays, D. X-11 ; A. II, 7. Length of types about 2^ inches. 

This sjiecies diflers from N. zonule in its less compressed l)ody and in 
coloration. In the latter species the ventrals are plain and the lateral 
bars encircle the bellj'. 

The types of this species, five in number, were taken in a tributary of 
Illinois Eiver, at Naper%ille, 111., by Dr. Ernest E. Copeland. One of 
these is in the U. S. National Museum, numbered 23454. 

3. PCECILICHTHYS VIRGATUS, Sp. nOV. 

A slender species, resembling an Mheosfoma, not closely related to 
any of the species thus far made known. 

Body moderately elongate, subfusiform, compressed ; the back some- 
what elevated, the caudal peduncle rather deep ; head long and rather 
pointed, little compressed, rather slender; the snout but little decurved; 
mouth rather large, somewhat oblique, the maxillary reaching to the 
l)upil, the lower jaw scarcely shorter than the upper; teeth small, even, 
in several rows; eye rather large; gill membranes not connected. 
Gheeli's, opercles, necl; and breast wholly nailed. Humeral region with an 
enlarged hlaclc scale-UJce process as in P. imnctulutvs, Ag,, and in the 
species of Etlieostoma. Posterior border of preopercle obtusely but 
distinctly crenate-dentate. Scales rather large — 53 in a longitudinal 
series, the lateral line distinct on about 20 of them. 

Color greenish, each scale with a small blackish spot, these forming 
conspicuous lateral stripes as in Etheostoma lineolatum. Back and sides

with cross-blotches. Vertical fins faintly barred. Humeral scale large 
and black. 

Head 3g in length without caudal ; depth 5. 

Fin rays, D. IX-10 ; A. II, 8. 

Length of types 2 to 2^ inches. 

This species differs from its congeners in its form and coloration. 
From all except P.lepidus, B. and G., it is separated by its naked head. 
From all but P. piuictulatus, Ag., by the black humeral process. 

The numerous typical examples were taken by me in the Rock Castle 
Eiver, at Livingston, Ky. Their resemblance to Etlieostoma flabellare 
caused them to be overlooked until lately. One of these is in the U. S. 
National Museum (iSlo. 2345G). Another has been forwarded to the 
British Museum. 

4. Zygonectes kubeifrons, sp. nov. 

Body moderately stout, little compressed, not elevated, the caudal 
peduncle deep ; head rather long, broad between the eyes, flat above ; 
eyes large, 3^ in head, their range horizontal ; mouth rather large. 
Teeth smaU, nearly even, in a narroic hand. Scales moderate. Dorsal 
fin very short and small, placed a little behind the anal or about even 
with it, its position in the males rather more posterior ; anal short, high 
in the males; ventrals very small; pectorals small. 

Color, males dark olivaceous, with a dark, bronze-orange spot on each 
scale posteriorly^, much as in Xenkma catenatum. Below these spots are 
bright orange. Faint orange, narrow vertical bars along the lower and 
posterior part of the body. Vertical fins with orange spots. Jaws and 
space in front of eyes bright orange-red ; paired fins dusky. Females 
almost uniform brassy-olivaceous, without evident spots or red luarkiugs. 

Head 3^ in length to base of caudal; depth 3f. D. 7 or 8; A. 8 or 9; 
lat. 1. 32 ; L. transv. 11 or 12 ; B. 5 ; L. 2^ to 3 inches. 

St. Sebastian Eiver, Florida, the numerous types collected by Dr. J. 
A. Henshall. A larger species than most in the genus, and with the 
dorsal fin less posterior. 

Some of these in the U. S. National ]Museum are numbered 23150. 

5. ZYGoarECTES hensiialli, sp. nov. 

Body rather stout, deep and compressed, the profile nearly straight, 
the back little elevated, and the caudal peduncle short and deep ; head 
moderate; mouth rather small; jaics each ivith a series of long and rather 
slender canine-like teeth, followed by a hand of small teeth; the canines 
larger in the lower jaw ; eye large ; scales rather large; dorsal fin short 
and high, inserted slightly behind the anal in the males, exactly oppo- 
site it in the females ; caudal large ; anal fin larger and rather lower 
than dorsal ; ventrals quite small ; pectorals moderate.

vertical fins ; dorsal dusky, with a dark bar ; head without red ; caudal 
and anal more or less yellow ; females obscurely marked ; youug with 
diffuse greenish vertical bars. 

Head 3i iu length to base of caudal; depth 3i. B. 5; D. 7 or 8; A. 
10 or 11; iat. 1. 33; L. transv. 10; L. 3 to 3f. 

San Sebastian Eiver, Florida, where it is abundant, in company with 
Jordanella forklfc, Zi/gonectes ruhrifrons, and other Cyprinodonts, the nu- 
merous types collected by Dr. J. A. Henshall. Some of these in the U. 

5. National Museum are numbered 23449. The largest species of the 
genus strongly resembling the preceding, from which it may be known 
by its dentition, its larger size, and the ditierent coloration. 

6. Ceratichthys lucens, sp. nov. 

Allied to Ceraticliihys hUjnttatm (Kirt.). 

Body elongate, compressed, the back somewhat elevated from the oc- 
ciput to the base of dorsal, thence rapidly declined to the long and 
slender caudal peduncle. Head short, compressed, the cheeks nearly 
vertical; interorbital space rather broad and flat, somewhat grooved; 
eye very large, circular, high up, placed nearly midway of the length of 
the head ; its diameter about equal to the length of the snout, and 
scarcely greater than the width of the interorbital space. Preorbital 
bone large, oblong, conspicuous and silvery ; suborbital bones rather 
narrow. 

Mouth ratlier small, horizontal, the lower jaw included, the edge of 
the premaxillary below the level of the eye ; the maxillary not reaching 
to the vertical from the front of the orbit. Barbel quite small. Snout 
boldly and abruptly decurved much as in C. amhlops (Raf.), the tip of 
the snout thickened, forming a sort of pad.

front, theuce nearly straight; about 16 scales in front of the dorsal, 42 
in the course of the lateral line ; 5 series above and 4 below. Eows of 
scales along the back converging behind the dorsal where the upper 
series run out, as in Luxilus conmtus. 

Fins rather higher and more falcate than in Ceratichthys hirpiffatus; 
the dorsal fin inserted well forward, directly over or slightly in advance 
of base of ventrals. Pectoral fins pointed, not reaching vent'rals, the 
ventrals not reaching the vent. 

Teeth 4-4, hooked, without grinding surface. 

Color translucent greenish above; sides and below brilliant!}" silvery; 
eye white; cheeks and oj^ercles with a bright silvery lustre; upper fins 
yellowish ; lower unspotted ; a slight i)lumbeous lateral shade, but no 
distinct markings anywhere either in large or small specimens. 

Length of bead contained 4^ times in total length to base of caudal ; 
greatest depth 4 times. 

Dorsal rays, I, 8 ; anal I, 8. 

Length of largest of typical examples 5J inches. 



PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 239 

This species is described from tliree examples taken at the Falls of 
tlie Ohio. Two of these are now in my own collection ; the third in the 
U. S. J^ational Musenm is nnmbered 23462. 

This species is larger than the others of the genus except C. higuttatus 
and the Californian C. symmetricm, (Grd.). In coloration it differs 
widely from G. higuttatus, whicli species is wholly destitute of silvery 
lustre. Its head is likewise shorter and blunter, and the mouth smaller. 
The form of the body very different. From C. amhlops, C. rubrifrons, 
etc., it differs in the number of teeth and in the smaller scales. 

7. LuxiLUS zoNiSTius, sp. nov. 

{Codoma eurystoma Jordan & Brayton, Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus. xii, 42, 52; not 
Fhotogenis eimjslomus Jordan, Ami. Lye. Nat. Hist. N. Y., 356, 1877.) 

Allied to Luxilus coccogenis, Cope. Body rather stout, compressed, 
the back elevated at the base of the dorsal fin, thence rapidly declined, 
the caudal peduncle rather short and slender. Head short and rather 
thick 5 interorbital space broad and tlat; cheeks nearly vertical. Length 
of head about equal to greatest depth of body, about 4 times in length 
to base of caudal. Eye large, longer than snout, about 3 in head, its 
diameter about equal to the interorbital space. Mouth comparatively 
large, oblique; in size intermediate between L. coccogenis and L. cornu- 
tus. Jaws about equal in the closed mouth. Premaxillary on the level 
of the pupil ; maxillary reaching to opposite the front of the eye. Pre- 
orbital short and deep ; suborbitals narrow. 

Scales large, G-43-3, closely imbricated on the sides of the body where 
they are much higher than long. Lateral line strongly decurved. 

Fins moderate. Dorsal fin inserted somewhat behind the line of the 
ventrals, I, 8, not much elevated. Anal longer than in the related 
species, 1, 10. Pectorals scarcely reaching ventrals; the ventrals reach- 
ing past the vent. 

Teeth 2, 4-4, 2, hooked, with narrow grinding surface. 

Color steel-blue above; sides somewhat silvery; dorsal fin with a 
conspicuous jet black cross-bar about half way up ; a distinct round 
black spot at base of caudal, rather smaller than the eye, behind this 
a cream-colored area, a curved black bar at the shoulder behind and 
above the opercle ; top of head and base of pectorals with dusky ]>unc- 
tulatioua. Females and young specimens have these dark markings ob- 
scure. Males in spring have the dorsal cross-bar scarlet and more or 
less dull ferruginous ; red on the head and caudal fin. The snout is 
covered with small tubercles in spring. 

The types of this species, about 20 in number, ranging from 2 to 4J 
inches in length, were taken in Suwannee Creek, a tributary of the 
Chattahoochee Eiver in Northern Georgia. 

A few young specimens of this species were mixed with the types of 
"P/«ofo</eni6'" eurijstomus, Jor., a species which the present one somewhat 
resembles. The specimens referred to by Jordan and Brayton (1. c.) as 
Codoma eurystoma are the types of the present species. Fhotogenis leu-

identical with ^^ Photogenis^^ eurystomns. Tlie teeth of gennine examples 
of the latter species are always 1, 4-4, 1. Those with the teeth 2, 4, all 
belong- to Luxihis zonisfius. 

One of the typical examples of this species is numbered 23452 in the 
U. S. National Museum. 

8. LucANiA GOODEI, sp. nov. 

Allied to Lucania parva ( Cyprinodon parvus^ Baird and Girard). Body 
elliptical, rather elongate, the back considerably elevated to a point 
just hi front of the origin of the dorsal fin ; the caudal peduncle rather 
deep and compressed ; greatest depth contained 4 to 4^ times in length 
to base of caudal. Head short, comparati^^ely narrow, and bluntly 
pointed, its length contained 3^ to 4 J times in length of body. Mouth 
small, terminal, both jaws with rather large conical canine-like teeth, 
apparently in a single series. Eye large, near the middle of the side of 
the head, its diameter contained 2.;V to 2f times in the length of the head, 
about equal to the width of the interorbital space. Scales large, their 
exposed surfaces higher than long, in about 30 (29 to 32) longitudinal 
and 7 vertical series. Humeral scale like the others. 

Fins large, especially in the males. Dorsal rays 9. Anal 9. Origin 
of dorsal about midway between snout and base of caudal, conspicu- 
ously in advance of anal. Height of dorsal fin in the males two-thirds 
the length of the head, about equal to the length of the base of the fin. 
In females a little lower. Anal fin similar and nearly as high and long, 
beginning nearly under the middle of the dorsal. Caudal moderate 
sub truncate. Ventrals long ; in the males reaching the front of the anal; 
in the females reaching the vent. Pectorals reaching past front of ven- 
trals in both sexes. 

Color olivaceous, the scales witli dark edgings. A very distinct black 
band in both sexes running through eye and snout straight to the base 
of the caudal, where it ends in a round black spot. This band is about 
as wide as a series of scales, although developed on parts of two series. 
A conspicuous black band in both sexes along the lower edge of the 
caudal peduncle, from the root of the caudal to the vent, dividing and 
passing on each side of the anal fin. Fins in the female plain. In the 
male Ijasal half of dorsal and anal jet black, outer half pale with a black 
edge. Pectorals and especially ventrals also dark-edged. Caudal fin 
faintly mottled. Vertical fins with more or less red in life {pie Goode). 

The typical specimens, about 30 in number, ranging from % to 1\ inches 
in length, were obtained in Arlington Kiver, Florida, a tributary of the 
St. John's, by Prof. G. Brown Goode, in company with Gimrdmus for- 
mosus, Zygonectes {Gamhusia) arUngtonensis. These are numbered 23505 
on the register of the U. S. National Museum. The species is well sep- 
arated from its congeners vcnusta and pa/rva by its black lateral band 
and colored fins. From the former the fewer tlorsal rays also distin- 
guish it.

By J. a. €OOFE>«, M. I>. 

Uuiformity in the dates of arrival of birds and laying eggs has usually 
been considered among the "constants of nature" in the temperate 
zone. Where the distinction of seasons is well marked, these events 
are among the most reliable phenomena connected with the climate, and 
exceptional dates are noted down with particular interest. 

It has, however, been ascertained that there is much less uniformity 
in the habits of the same species within the tropics. There being no 
changes of temperature, the division into wet and dry seasons, where 
existing, can alone influence them. It does so by regulating the How- 
ering and fruiting of trees, etc., on which the food of birds directly or 
indirectly depends (except in the case pf aquatic species), the rapacious 
kinds following the vegetivorons in their search for food. 

Even on the border of the temperate zone, in Arizona "and Florida 
(probably also in Texas), an approacu to the irregularity of tropical 
habits has been observed, some species laying-^ eggs in autumn, at the 
end of the rainy season, and many abandoning the migratory habits 
seen northward. 

In California we might e:^pectto tind similar conditions, because of the 
mildness of the winters in the less elevated regions, giving us an almost 
subtropical climate. But it can only have an efiect south of latitude 
34°, in the lower part of the Colorado Valley, if anywhere, sufficiently 
marked to cause the birds to lay in autumn, though its influence is seen 
to some extent in the wintering of several species farther north than on 
the east coast. 

As fiir south as frost extends, v.isich is south of San Diego and 
perhaps to Fort Yuma, the habits of the temperate zone lirevail. At 
Tucson^ Arizona, however, where Ca])tain Benuire notice<l eggs laid in 
autumn, the advantage of being about thirty miles south of Fort Yuma 
is compensated for by the elevation being 748 feet greater. Tiie more 
barren, almost desert character of the country near Fort Yuma is proba- 
bly the reason why such habits among the birds are not noticed, perhaps 
also because no observers have looked for them at the right season. 
The only peculiar climatic influence observable in California is therefore

depeudent ou the alternatiou of wet and dry seasons, wliicb prevails in 
less degree along the whole coast northward. 

It is indeed the excess of rain until quite late in spring, which ap- 
pears to prevent the earlier laying of eggs by some species that begin 
to lay in the east earlier than on this slope. This is noticeable among 
Hawks and Owls, and may also be expected with the Crossbills, 'Wax- 
wings, and others breeding ftirther north, but of which no records exist 
for this coast. Xorth of latitude 00^, however, where Professor Dall found 
so many eastern species mixed with the western, the division into wet 
and dry seasons is not marked, which may account for the breeding 
there of those eastern birds not found south of that latitude on this 
coast. 

In California we find the influence of the rains causing considerable 
difference in dates of laying in various localities, where they end sooner 
or later. Thus at Fort Moja\e, Colorado Yalley. though the winter is 
colder than at San Diego, it is much drier, the climate, lilvC that of Ari- 
zona, being wet in summer. I therefore found the same species laying 
much earlier at Fort Mojave, though the arrival of migratory birds 
was generally later, more so than the difference of latitude (one hun- 
dred and forty miles fiirther north) would account for. jMany species 
are also found wintering there which do not remain along the rainy coast 
at that season. 

At Haywood, on the east side of San Francisco Bay, I also found 
many species laying earlier and more abundantly than at Santa Cruz on 
the coast, forty-eight miles farther south, but more rainy. This last 
place is itself much more favorable to most species than the foggy cool 
promontory of Monterey, twenty-five miles southward. 

Of the influence of climate in localities still farther inland I cannot 
state much from personal observation north of Fort Mojave, but have 
quoted some interesting dates for comparison, reported by Mr. Eidg- 
way at Sacramento, though of less value in this connection than if he 
had been there earlier and later in the season. 

On account of the great elevation and very different climate of Ne- 
vada and Utah, his observations there are of little value for comparison 
with Western California, though in some degree comparable with Fort 
Mojave. 

The period at which rains cease being quite different in different 
years, we also find considerable variation in the arrival of some birds 
as well as in dates of laying at any locality selected. In some years the 
migrants seem to take a much more inland route northward than in 
others, not appearing along the coast until long after their comrades 
* hiive rcached even to Alaska. Thus Mr. Dall records the arrival and 
laying of some species along the Yukon at about the same times they are 
recorded netir the California coast. 

The moderately dry parfs of California, where, south of latitude 
380, trees are limited chiefly to the northeast slopes of hills and the 
banks of streams, we find to be the favorite breeding grounds of most

western birds (except of course the water-loving species), nests being 
both far more numerous and more easily found than in the thickly 
wooded regions of the mountains and northern coast. I have myself 
found more in one spring in the vicinity of Haywood, than during three 
seasons near the Columbia River. A similar abundance of nests has 
been noted by me along the sparsely wooded shores of the Upi)er 
jMissouri River, and similar streams crossing the "Great Plains" on 
both sides of the Rocky Mountains. The scattered tree-growth of those 
regions, like that of an old cultivated country, is therefore most favor- 
able for the increase of most land-birds, and if moderate protection in- 
stead of persecution is granted to them, they may always continue 
abundant even when the country is cultivated. The little fertile valleys 
scattered through the desert regions west of the Rocky Mountains are 
always found to contain most of the birds, and being also attractive to 
settlers, the abundance of birds has been wrongly attributed to their 
presence. The only way in which settlements aid in the increase of 
birds is by driving off or killing the rapacious kinds, and thus protect- 
ing such of the small species as do not injure the crops. 

There is no doubt of the increase in numbers of many species about 
the settlements of California-, from this cause, since' 1840, but others, 
especially game-birds and birds of prey, have very much diininished 
under the effect of persecution by the gun, and poisoning, through the 
use of poisoned grain intended to kill vermin. 

The influence of the more local attachments of the west-coast birds, 
which are so generally constant residents instead of migratory, is also 
very soon observed in the disappearance of a species from a neighbor- 
hood like ITaywood, where they have been robbed of their nests and 
eggs for several seasons. The same thing seems to keep away migra- 
tory species to some extent, though other reasons may be found for their 
absence. As instances, the Blue-birds {Sialia) entirely disappeared in 
1878, not returning even in winter ; though I knew of several of their 
nests that were not molested in 1877. The migratory Lawrence's Gold- 
finch and Blue Linnet {Oyanospiza) also failed to appear in the breeding 
season of 1878, perhaps from former persecutions, and perhaps from 
taking another route northward, or from causes yet unknown. 

As a rule scarcely any of the birds of California, south of latitude 
SS'^', raise two broods in a season. When late broods are fouud tliey 
seem either to be replacements of lost broods, or are perhaps hatclied 
by one parent while the other still takes care of a first brood, as ob- 
served by me in the case of a pair of House Wrens. This is tiie effe(3t 
of the rapidity with which the breeding season passes, corresponding 
to the rapid but short growing season of vegetation after the frosts 
cease and before it becomes too dry. Caterpillars and other soft insects 
suitable for the young become scarce when the vegetation gets dry. 
Even swallows, which feed in the air, are obliged to catch young grass- 
hoppers in some localities near the coast in June, so that they can raise 



244 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

two broods of youug. Apparently an effort to raise a third or a very 
late brood causes tliein ofteu to abandon it to star\'e when they leave us 
in August. 

In tbe following- table I have included only those land-birds that are 
l)est observed in regard to habits, giving the records I have made at 
the chief localities where I have collected in the proper seasons, and 
adding such notes as seemed suitable, made by me in other localities, 
and by others where exact dates of the events are given. The object 
has been to give exact dates of the nsual arrival and departure (with 
;i few also quite exceptional), and the first laying of eggs noticed, as 
Avell as the latest when long after. A few quotations of observations 
in other regions are also given for comparison, but these are much fewer 
than desirable from the fact that the older authors neglected usually to 
give the exact dates, and where the month only is given a comparison of 
times through a range of twenty degrees of latitude is impracticable. 
The (categories of " Eesident," etc., refer only to the localities given in 
tbe general table. 

The arrangement of localities being by date of collections is not ex- 
actly accordhig to their relative positions in latitude. 

My opportunities for observing in regard to most aquatic birds have 
been too few to be worth noting, the sea-shore and the great interior 
marshes or lakes not having been visited at the proper seasons, except' 
in a few localities. Where it is practicable the dates of laying of the 
Gulls, Murres, and other birds whose eggs are collected for market, are 
found quite uniform, though showing the influence of early or late sea- 
sons in a certain degree. This makes them well worthy of record when- 
ever opportunities are offered.

DESCRIPTIOIVS OF NE%V SPECIES OF CAKBONIFEROUS INVERTE- 
BRATE FOSSIES. 

By C. A. WHITE. 

The fossils herein described are among the collections of the National 
Museniu. The coral was obtained by Prof. O. St. John in the Black- 
foot Eange of inonntains, sonthward from the Yellowstone National 
Park, in the snmmer of 1877, wliile prosecnting- his work as geologist of 
one of the parties of the snrvey then in charge of Dr. F. V. Hayden. 
The spines of Arelmocidaris are a part of a small collection of Upper 
Coal Measnre fossils sent by Mr. Frank M. Dininny from Tecnmseh, 
Nebraska. The fonr species of crinoids, here described as new, consti- 
tnte part of a collection which has been for several years in the cases of 
the Mnsenm, the donor of which collection is nnfortnnately unknown. 
The only label accompanying the fossils contained only the following 
inscription: "From thirty miles west of Humboldt, Kansas." The 
place thus indicated, as determined by a Land-Office map, is in the val- 
ley of one of the upper branches of Verdigris River, a tributary of Ar- 
kansas River. Besides the four new species just mentioned, those enu- 
merated with them in the following list constitute this interesting col- 
lection : 

1. PlaUjcerm nebrascensis, Meek. 

2. Flnna peracuta, Shumard ? 

3. Terebratula millq)unctata, Hall. 

4. Spirifer cameratus, INIorton. 

5. Spirifer {Martinia) Uneatiis, Martin. 

6. Sjriyifer [Martinia) plamconvexus^ Shumard. 

7. Spiriferina l-cnfucl^oisis, Shumard. 

8. Spirigera subfUita, Hall. 

9. Eefzia mormonii, Marcou. 

10. Hemipronites crassus. Meek and Hayden. 

11. MceMIa striatocostata, Cox. 

12. Prodiictus semireticulatiis, Martin. 

13. Productus piinctatus, Martin. 
11. Productus longifiinnus, Sowerby. 
15. Productus nebrascensis^ Owen. 
10. Cijathaxonia distorta, Worthen. 

17. FistuJiiwra nodulifera, Meek. 

18. Rhombipora lepidodendroides, Meek. 

19. Glauconome ? 

20. Lecythiocrinus olUculceformis, sp. nov. 

21. Cyathocrinus stillativus, sp. nov. 

22. Erisocrinus typus, Meek and Worthen. 

23. Erisocrinus planus^ sp. nov. 
21. Rhodocrinus resperalis, sp. nov. 

Besides these there v/ere fragments of three other species of crinoids

belonging to tlie Cyafhocn'mdcv. Altliough all, or nearly all, the cri 
noids hitherto published from the Upper Coal Measures of the United 
States, belong to the Ci/athocrinidw, the species ^o. 21 of the foregoing 
list is the first one known from that formation which presents exactly 
the calycular formula of true Cyathocrinus. Besides this two of the 
other new species of crinoids belong- to genera that have hitherto been 
unknown in North American strata above the Subcarbouiferous, one of 
them, indeed, being never before known to exist. Such facts demanded 
rigid inquiry as to whether these strange forms might not have been 
derived from some older formation, and become accidentally mixed with 
those from the Upper Coal Measures, especially as the package was not, 
when first examined by me, securely closed, and the record was defective 
as before indicated. All the specimens were therefore subjected to care 
fid examination under the lens, which disclosed the fact that some one or 
more of these new forms had adhering to its surface a greater or less num- 
ber of minute fragments of Polyzoans, which were not only recognized as 
Upper Coal Measure species, but fragments of the same were found adher- 
ing to many of the well-known Upper Coal Measure brachiopods asso- 
ciated with them in the collection. In addition to this, the character and 
as])ect of the imbedding matrix, so far as it remained with the fossils, 
were found to be essentially the same upon both the new and well-known 
forms. There appears, therefore, to be no room for reasonable doubt that 
these new forms, as well as the others which are associated with them in 
the collection, came from Upper Coal Measure strata at the locality indi- 
cated by the label as before mentioned -, and that they are all from sub- 
stantially the same local horizon. The loss of the record of the donor's 
name is to be regretted, but it was no doubt occasioned by the confusion 
into which a part of the collections of the Museum fell at the time of 
the fire which a few years ago damaged the building of the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

The discovery of these new crinoidal forms is not only interesting in 
itself, but it is imjiortant as showing a persistence of certain paleozoic 
crinoidal types up to almost the closing epoch of Paleozoic time as it is 
represented by North American strata. The intimate relationship of 
at least the brachiopodal fauna of the Subcarbouiferous series of tlie 
Mississippi Valley (especially that of the Chester limestone member of 
that series) with that of the Upper Coal Measure limestone and shales 
is well known. Indeed, quite a number of the brachiopods of these 
two formations we must consider as specifically identical. The case is 
different, however, with the crinoidal fauuie of the two formations as re- 
gards specific identity, for they afford no exception to the rule tliat fos- 
sil crinoids have a narrowly limited vertical range. But in the case of 
these fossils there is shown by this collection to be a recurrence of 
formerly existing types, or, more properly speaking, these newly dis- 
covered types indicate the continuation through preceding ei>ochs of

certain g-oneric and family- types, tbat liave heretofore been discovered 
only in the strata representing the earher of those epochs. Thns Rho- 
docrinus vesperalis and Cyathocrimts stiUaiivus have their nearest known 
representatives in the Burlington limestone of the Subcarboniferons 
series. This is interesting because the crinoidal fiiuna of the Upper 
Coal IMeasures had hitherto presented a good degree of contrast with 
corresponding faunjie of the diiferent divisions of the Subcarboniferons 
group as well as with that of the group as a whole. For example, as has 
been already mentioned, there is a great preponderance of the Cijatho- 
crinidcc in the Upper Coal Measure strata. These are mostly of peculiar 
types, and their bodies are mostly also composed of massive pieces. 
Erisocrinus is peculiar to this latest of the Carboniferous epochs, as rep- 
resented by the strata of the great Mississippi Valley, and it is interest- 
ing- to note that the new genus LccijtMocrinus agrees with it in excluding 
the whole of the anal series of its pieces from participating in the struct- 
ure of the calyx. 

The other species of crinoids which are named in the list as associ- 
ated with these new forms bel<)ng to types, either generic or interge- 
neric, which have been hitherto found only in Upper Coal Measure strata. 

The spines of the species here described as Arcluvocidaris dininnn 
give a very inadequate idea of the characteristics of the wliole animal, 
and such a description has very little value in zoological classification; 
but for the convenience of geological study it is thought best to give 
systematic names even to such zoologically imperfect objects as these, 
that they may be used in the classification of all the recognizable fos- 
sils which characterize different formations respectively. The species 
represented by these spines has quite a wide geological range in the 
Upper Coal Measures of the valleys of the Lower Missouri and Upper 
Mississippi Eivers, and their characteristics are such that the species may 
be readily recognized. 

Tlie full Carboniferous series of the great Eocky Mountain region is 
several thousand feet in thickness ; and the horizon within this limit, 
from which the coral herein described as Acervularia adjunctiva comes, 
is not accurately known. This discrepancy, however, is apparently of 
less importance than it otherwise would be, from the fact that not only 
is the great Carboniferous series of that region not marked off into 
epochal groups in the same manner that it is in the Mississippi Valley, 
but it is there everywhere difficult to find any recognizable planes, 
either paleontological or stratigraphical, for the separation of the series 
into any well-defined groups.

ACTIXOZOA. 

Genus Aceevulaeia, Scliweijjfger. 

Acenrularia adjunctiva (sp. nov.)- Plate 1, figs. 1, 2, and 3. 

Corallum massive or subdiscoidal, composed of compactly united 
corallites of somewhat unequal size ; corallites approximately straight, 
irregularly polygonal, averaging about live millimeters in diameter, 
their outer surfaces faintly marked by vertical lines which indicate 
the places of the septa within, but they are not sufficiently distinct to 
give a crenulated border to the calyx ; these surfaces also present more 
or less distinct irregular transverse wrinkles or undulations ; outer wall 
of the corallites distinct but not thick ; inner wall well develoi)ed ; di- 
ameter of the space inclosed by the inner wall equal to about one-half 
the full diameter of the corallite; the transverse tabulae of this central 
space well developed, distinctly separate from each other, their number 
being about ten to each centimeter of length of the corallite. The 
space between the outer and inner walls is occupied by numerous more 
or less complete shallow infundibuliform plates, which are not quite so 
numerous as the central tabular. These i^lates spring from the inner 
wall, which they successively help to form, and arch ui)ward and outward 
to the outer wall ; being the successively abandoned floors of the outer 
portion of the calyces. They appear to have been not always complete, 
either as regards their extension to the outer wall or their construction 
of a symmetrical cup, but they are apparently no more imperfect in 
these respects than the calyces of such corals often are. 

The condition of the onl^^ specimens discovered is not such as to show 
any of the calyces in their natural condition, and the structure of the 
corallites has therefore been determined by the examination of polished 
sections, both longitudinal and transverse. While the parts already 
described are thus distinctly shown, the rays are discovered Avith dif- 
ficulty, and they were evidently only slightly developed 5 their number, 
as near as it can be ascertained, is about 16 or 17. 

The genus Acervularia has been regarded as peculiarly a Devonian 
form, but as related corals are common to both Devonian and Carbo- 
niferous strata, there appears no good reason why Acervularia may not 
exist in the latter. This form seems to differ from the typical species 
of that genus, at least to such an extent as might be naturally expected 
of it, when found in strata of so much later date than those which con- 
tain the typical forms. This is an interesting form, not only as regards 
its structure, but also in consequence of the marked difference which it 
presents from anj^ Actinozoan yet described from American Carbonifer- 
ous strata.

ECHIXODERMATA. 

Genus Lecythiocrinus {gen. no v.). 

Etym. At/kvOiov, a small oil flask. 

Generic formula. — Basal pieces, 3; subradial pieces, 5; first radial 
pieces, 5 ; aual and iiiterradial pieces, 0. 

Generic diagnosis. — The basal, subradial, and first radial pieces are 
all well developed, none of them being minute. The dome is not known, 
but it was very small in comparison with the size of the body. The 
facet for the attachment of the column is small and round, but the col- 
umn is not known. The facets for the attachment of the arms are 
small ; the arms are not known, but they were five in number, and evi- 
dently small and delicate. Tlie character, shapes, and arrangement of 
the three basal pieces are precisely as in Platycrinus, and the arrange- 
ment of the five subradial pieces upon them is the same as that of the 
first radials upon the basals in Flatycrinns. The arrangement of the 
first radial i)ieces upon the subradials is essentially the same as that of 
Urisocrimis ; that is, they alternate regularly with each other and have 
no anal or interradial pieces intervening. The body, which is the 
only portion of the animal yet known, is therefore composed of thirteen 
pieces, the arrangement of which is essentially that of five first radials, 
all in close contact with each other, superimposed upon the calyx-struc- 
ture of Platycrinus. Or, if it be assumed that the basal cycle of pieces 
in the body of every true crinoid contains the elements of five pieces, 
and that hi case there are only three apparent in the adult state, as in 
Actinocrinns and many species of Platijcrinns, there has been an early 
ancylosis of two adjacent pieces in two cases, we may regard Lecythio- 
crinus as a Cyathocrinid thus modified. I am disposed to adopt this 
view, and I therefore refer the new genus to the Cyathocrinidw. It is 
thought to be not improbable tliat if other species of this genus should 
be discovered the base may be found to be composed of five separate 
pieces instead of three, but no trace of a fourth and fifth suture can be 
discovered in tlie base of the form here described. In case other exam- 
ples should prove to possess a base composed of five pie(!es, the other 
chara(;teristics which it possesses are still sufflcient to hold it as a new 
generic form among the Crinoidea. 

Only one example of this interesting crinoid, consisting of the body 
alone, has been discovered. It is small and delicate in structure, the 
delicacy of the pieces com])osing it being similar to that of certain 
species of Platycrinus and Dichocrinus found in the Burlington lime- 
stone. In this respect it differs from all the hitherto known crinoids of 
the Upper Coal Measures, the pieces composing tiie bodies of which are

thick and often massive. This delicacy of structure is probably a ge- 
neric characteristic. 

Lecythiocrinus oUiculaeformis (sp. nov.). Plate 1, figs. 4 aud 5. 

Body small, subovoid or pot-shaped, higher than broad, broadest a 
little below the middle, composed of thin pieces ; base convex ; basal 
pieces rather small but not minute; subradial pieces larger than any of 
the others, higher than wide, their height equal to a little more than 
half the full height of the body, not materially varying in size or 
shape ; first radial pieces smaller than the subradials but larger than 
the basals, broader below than above, height and greatest breadth about 
equal ; at top, on both sides of the small prominent arm -facet, the 
border of each first radial is bent inward, constricting the already nar- 
row interbrachial space at the top of the body, which space was prob- 
ably covered by a dome of minute pieces. Sutures not impressed or 
otherwise specially marked. Surface, to ordinary vision, apparently 
smooth, but a good lens shows it to be very finely granular. 

Height, 9 millimeters ; breadth, 7^ millimeters. 

Position and locality. — Upper Coal Measure strata, thirty miles west of 
Humljoldt, Kansas. See introductory remarks. 

Genus Erisocrinus, Meek and Worthen. 

Erisocrinus planus (sp. nov.). Plate 1, figs. 6 aud 7. 

Body rather small, subcircular or obscurely pentahedral as viewed 
from above or below, shallow convex-basin-shaped from the top of the 
first radials downward ; base somewhat deeply impressed at the center, 
the depression gradually rounding outwaril to the sides; basal pieces 
very small, occupying the bottom of the depression of the base and al- 
most covered by the first joint of the column ; subradial pieces mod- 
erately large, their inner ends bent inwardly by the depression of the 
base to meet the small basal pieces there, their outer ends extending 
outward and upward so as to be more or less plainly visible by side 
Anew of the body ; first radial pieces comparatively large, convex verti- 
cally, their upper edges rounded inward to the suture between them aud 
the second radials, their lower angles extending downward almost to 
the lowest portion of tlie body visible by side view. The other charac- 
ters are those common to the genus. One minute piece remains attached 
to the upper border of the calyx of one of the specimens, at the junction 
of two of the first radial pieces. This is no doubt an anal piece, its 
outer surface being in the plane of the outer surface of the calyx, but 
it does not in any degree enter betwe^^n the two first radials upon which 
it rests. 

Transverse diameter of the calyx, 14 millimeters ; height of the same, 
5 millimeters.

258 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

This species differs from U. typiis in having a shallower and more 
ronnded basin-shaped calyx, proportionally smaller basal, and larger 
snbradial pieces, and a more deeply impressed base. It very closely re- 
sembles the Poterlocrinus hemisphericus of Shnmard, examx)les of wliicli 
are associated with it in the collection. Indeed, so far as the character- 
istics of the calyx alone are concerned, there appears to be no essential 
difference except in the relative position of the small anal i^iece. In 
Erisocrinus no anal X)iece is recognized as entering into the strnctnre of 
the calyx, at least none that is visible npon the outer surface, as a 
greater or less number of such pieces do in Cyathocrinus and Foterio- 
crinus, but I am not without suspicion that this form which I have, 
according to the recognized usage in the limitation of genera, here 
described as new, really belongs to the same species with P. liemisplieri- 
ciis, Shumard, and that the displacement of the small anal piece from 
the rim of the calyx is an individual variation only. If this should 
prove to be the case it is clear that a revision of the generic formula of 
Erisocrinus will be necessary ; and it will doubtless also be necessary to 
assign the type of this proposed species to P. hemisphericus, Shumard. 
It is clear tbat the last-named species does not strictly belong to either 
Poteriocrinus or Cyathocrinus, but it is not my purpose to discuss the 
generic relations of these forms at this time. Figure 8, plate 1, repre- 
sents an example of the P. hemisphericus of Shumard, which is introduced 
for comparison witli those of E. planvs. 

Position and locality. — Upper Coal Measures, thirty miles west of 
Humboldt, Kansas. See introductory remarks. 

Genus Cyathocrinus, Miller. 

Cyathocrinus stillativus (sp. nov.). Plate 1, figs. 9 and. 10. 

Body below the upper border of the first radial pieces shallow basin- 
shaped, much wider than high, having a narrow, moderately deep, 
abrupt, five-sided depression at the center of the base, at the bottom of 
which is the facet for the attachment of the column; composed of 
eighteen moderately thick and strong pieces, all of which, except the 
basals, are more or less tumid in their middle portion, some of them 
I)resenting an irregular, uneven surface, which, with the imx)ressed 
sutures and the still more deeply impressed corners of the pieces, gives 
the surface of the body a decidedly rugose aspect; basal pieces very 
small, occupying the bottom of the depression at the base, the greater 
part of each being covered Ijy the first joint of the column; snbradial 
pieces having their height and width about eqnal, four of them pen- 
tagonal, and one, that which is next below the first anal piece, hex- 
agonal, there being no appreciable angle upon that side of any of them 
whi(;h adjoins the basal pieces; first radial pieces much larger than the 
snbradial, wider than their full height including the arm facet ; the two 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 259 

wliicli are adjacent to the anal series being very little if any narrower 
than the others ; arm facets large, about one-third wider than high, 
their plane being nearly vertical, notched at the upper border and 
marked transversely by the double ridge or raised lines which are com- 
mon to the arm facets of many of the Cj/athocrinidw; anal pieces three 
known, nearly equal in size, or the first a little larger than the two second, 
each with a prominent tubercle at the center ; first anal piece five-sided, 
abutting against one subradial, two first radials and two second anal 
pieces ; the two second anal pieces abut against the first anal, against 
each other, and each abuts against a first radial. 

Diameter of calyx, 14 millimeters; height of the same, G millimeters. 

This is the first and only species of true Cijatliocrinus that has to my 
knowledge yet been discovered in Upper Coal Measure strata; G. in- 
flexus, Geinitz, and C. hemisphericns, Shumard, sp., not being regarded as 
typical species of that genus. It belongs to a type that is more char- 
acteristic of the Burlington limestone division of the Subcarboniferous 
than of any other division of the great Carboniferous series, and to- 
gether with the next described form it shows the crinoidal fauna of the 
Upper Coal Measures to be more intimately related to that of the Sub- 
carboniferous than it has before been known to be. 

Position and locality. — Upper Coal Measure strata, thirty miles west 
of Humboldt, Kansas. See introductory remarks. 

Genus Ehodgcrinus, Miller. 

Rliodocriiius vesperalis (sp. uov.). Plate 1, figs. 11 and 19. 

Body subglobose, the sides and outer portion of the base continuously 
convex ; the base having a deep, sharjily defined, five-sided pit which 
contains the whole of the five basal pieces, and also the sharply in- 
flexed inner ends of the five subradial pieces ; the latter pieces moder- 
ately large, but not much larger than some of the radials and inter- 
radials ; first radial pieces varying a little in size in the different rays, 
the larger ones nearly or quite as large as the subradial ; second radials 
much smaller than the first, and the third radials still much smaller 
than the second, the difference in size being greater in their A^ertical 
than in their transverse diameter. The third radial in each ray, which 
is very narrow vertically, supports two brachial pieces, and they in turn 
each support another brachial piece, beyond which the structure is un- 
known ; interradial pieces up to a line with the center of the arm bases, 
three for four of the interradial spaces, and four for that of the anal . 
side; the first or lower interradials are of about equal size in each of 
the spaces, and a little larger than the two next above ; dome moder- 
ately convex, prominent opposite the arms and somewhat depressed be- 
tween them, composed of numerous small pieces ; proboscis subcentral, 
its length unknown. All the iDieces of the body, except those of the 



260 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

base, are sliglitly tumid, their surfaces being rugose or wrinkled, and in 
some if not all cases marked by obscure lines which radiate from the 
center of each piece in groups of threes, and become continuous with 
similar lines on adjoining pieces. 

Height from the base of the body to the base of the proboscis, 32 
millimeters ; breadth of the same, ] 6 millimeters. 

Although this species serves as a very suggestive link between the 
crinoidal fauna of the Upper Coal Measures and that of the Subcarbo- 
niferous, especially that of the Burlington limestone division of that 
series, it differs too much specifically from any described form embraced 
by that genus to need detailed comparisons. 

Position and locality. — Upper Coal Measure, thirty miles west of Hum- 
boldt, Kansas. See introductory remarks. 

Genus Aech^ocidaeis, McCoy. 

Archaeocidaris dininnii. Plate 1, figs. I'.i, 14, and 15. 

Principal spines fusiform, moderately strong, 50 or 60 millimeters 
long, the greatest diameter being about the middle, which is there 
about 5 millimeters. The diameter of the basal ring of such a specimen 
is about 3J millimeters, and the short neck or j^lain space above it is 
scarcely 2i millimeters in thickness. Above the short plain neck the 
whole spine is studded with irregularly disposed spinules, 1 to 2 millime- 
ters in length, which stand out at nearly right angles with the axis of the 
spine, except near its point, where they are directed upward. The spi- 
nules are usually more numerous and stronger upon the lower portion of 
the spine than elsewhere, and upon the middle portion of the large 
spines they are sometimes obsolete, apparently from some other cause 
than accidental removal. The smaller spines are often not so thickly 
studded with spinules as the larger ones, and they are usually more 
slender or less fusiform than the larger; and some of them seem to 
have been without a basal ring. 

A marked peculiarity of this species is the abundance of spinules 
upon the spine, especially its lower portion, and the general position of 
most of them at nearly right angles to its axis. 

Position aiid locality. — Uj^per Coal Measures, near Tecumseh, Nebras- 
ka, whence it was sent with other Upper Coal Measure fossils by Mr. 
Frank M. Dininny, in whose honor the specific name is given. This 
species has also been recognized by me in rocks of that formation iu 
other portions of Nebraska and also in Western Iowa.

A STrWY OF THE TRnVK-FISHES (OSTRACIOlVTIDyE), IVITII NOTES 
UPON THE AIYIERICAN SPECIES OF THE FAIUI1.V. 

By G. ISnOWX OOODS. 

The fishes of the order PlectognatJd have afforded a knotty problem 
to writers on systematic ichthyology. Many genera have been estab- 
lished, and, between them, the several species have been buffeted to and 
fro until their synonymy is tangled like a spider's web. The following 
historical sketch of the progress of opinion in the classification of the 
Ostracionts was drawn up as an aid in determining what generic names 
should be used for the common West Indian forms. 

Artedi and Linnteus were acquainted only with those which have the 
carapace closed behind the anal fin, now included by Giinther in the 
subgeiuis Ostracion. The first of the other type, with carapace open 
behind the aual fin, was described by Houttuyn in 1782,* and again by 
Thunberg, under another name, eight years subsequently .t Schneider, 
Shaw^, Lacepede, and their contemporaries recognized only the old genus, 
and it was not until 1838 that Dr. Gray separated certain species under 
the name Aracana.\ 

Lacepede was the first to propose a division of the genus Ostracion, 
though he did not advocate the use of names for his subgenera, nor 
indeed propose any. His divisions were based upon the arrangement 
of the spiues on the carapace, as given below. He knew no representa- 
tives of the Aracana type.

The next attempt at a subdivision was by Swainson in 1839,* and was 
based entirely upon the shape of the carapace. The peculiar features 
of this arrangement can most easily be shown by quoting in full from 
the preliminary synopsis (p. 194).

statement of a qiiadraugular character for Tctrosomus it would appear 
certain that the three following divisions were intended as suhgenera, 
subordinated to Tetrosomus. As it is, it seems to he more than probable 
that an omission was made by the author, and that the diagnosis should 
read " triangular or quadrangular," for the species chosen as type of 
TctroHomus is in fact pentagonal. This, however, would throw out 
RJdnesomus and certain species in Lactopltnjs. Be this as it may, we 
have no right to guess at the real meaning of the author ; these divis- 
ions are treated as genera in every particular except that their names 
are in italics instead of capitals, and as genera they must be quoted, 
charging discrepancies to the account of carelessness and bad workman- 
ship. 

In 1855 the group underwent another revision at the hands of Dr. 
Kaup.* Besides forming several new subgenera for the Ac«rrt><a-like 
forms he made a complete redistribution of the species among the 
genera. Reg'arding the triangular species as types of the genus Ostra- 
cion of Linniiius he proposed a new generic name, Cibotion, for Ostracion 
as limited by Swainson, and in this groujj placed 0. tuherculatus, 0. cu- 
Meus, 0. punctatus, 0. argus, 0. cyanurus, and 0. Sebae. In '■'■ Lwto- 
X)hryfij Swains, (part)," he placed O.comutm, O.fornasini, and 0. diaplia- • 
nus, all species with si)inous,lbur-ridged carapaces, while in " Ostracion^ 
Linn, (part), Kaup," which he regarded as equivalent to lihinosomus and 
TctraNoinus, Swauis., he placed all the triangular species, wiiich he di- 
vided into live sections: "a. Without long spines over the eyes and on 
the edges of the body" — 0. triqueter. "b. With spines near the anal- 
fin" — 0. hicaudaUs, 0. trigonus, and 0. oviceps (= 0. trigomis). "c. 
With spines over the eyes and on the edge of the carapace" — 0. quadri- 
cornis. "d. With li-3 short spines on the elevated dorsal ridge, short 
spines over the eye and upon the edges of the very broad carapace, 
diminishing with age to weak points" — 0. coneatenatus. "e. With 
strongly (juadrangular body and much elevated back, provided with a 
strong spine; spines over the eyes and on the lower edges of the cara- 
pace." — 0. gihhosus. 

In the following year a fresh revision was undertaken by Prof. H. 
Hollard, of the Faculty of Sciences at Poitiers,t who reassembled in 
the one genus, Ostracion^ all the species with a post- abdominal bridge to 
the carapace, retaining for the others the name Aracana, Gray. In this 
usage he is followed by Dr. Bleeker in his later publication, though he 
freely admits that earlier in his career as an ichthyologist, impressed 
like his predecessors by the diversified forms of the known species of 
Ostraeionts, he was inclined to believe that many genera could be dis- 
tinguished among them. "But," he continues, "in searching for char- 
acters which should define them satisfactorily, I discovered that I could

tiiid none." Uleeker admits three genera, Ostracion, Aracana, and Ccn- 
tauntii, the latter founded on a grotesque form known to ichthyologists 
only from a drawing of a very young individual made by Dr. Hooker. 
Ostracion is divided by Bleeker into subgenera as follows : 

Ostntcian, Art. = Tctwsoiiim, Swds. = RhuicfiOinaSj Swiis. ^= Latophrys, Swns. 
:=^ Vibotloii, Kp.

typ. Ostracion quadricornis, L.* 

These divisions correspond very closely to those of Lacepede already 
referred to; Ostracion heing equivalent to section 1, La'tophrys to section 
3, while section 4 is about equally divided between Tetrosomus and 
Acanthostracion. 

Dr. Giinther,! like Hollard and Bleeker, considers the typical Ostra- 
cions to be embraced within the limits of one natural genus, and even 
includes those with carapace open behind the anal tin. Such, at least, is 
his course in the generic diagnosis of Ostracion, though he actually 
adopts the name Aracana as if it represented a true genus, and enumer- 
ates the species under a separate series of numbers. 

In arranging the species of Ostracion he adheres rather to the method 
of Swainson than of Lacepede, considering the shape of the carapace to 
be the most convenient basis of classification. His divisions are as fol- 
lows : 

I. Carapace tliree ridged. 
II. Carapace four or five ridged, without spines. 
III. Carapace four ridged witli spines. 

The third division corresponds exactly to Swainson's Tetrosomus, if 
his diagnosis be accepted without change, the second division to Swain- 
son's Ostracion and Kaup's Oihotion, the first division to the three last 
subgenera (?) of Swainson, which he probably meant to subordinate to 
a third genus which he neglected to name. 

The usage of American authors has been various. Storer, although 
he described his Holmes' Hole specimen under the name Ostracion Yalei, 
accepted in his "Synopsis" the names Ehincsomus triqueter and Lacto- 
])hrys sexcornis.

Professor Gill, in 1873, catalogued the east coast species as Lactoplirys 
trigonus* 

Poej^, ill liis " Synopsis Piscium Cubensiuni,"t follows the lead of 
Bleeker, accepting his subgenera though not bracketing them into the 
midtlle of the binomial names as was the practice of the Dutch zoolo- 
gist. In a later work, the " Enumeratio Piscium Cubensium," he adopts 
the genera Ostraciofi, Acanthostracion, and Lactoplirys. Jordan uses the 
name Lactophrys quadricornis, accepting provisionally Swainson's ar- 
rangement. 

After studying the group, as represented in the collections of the 
National Museum, I am unable to recognize any characters sufficiently 
persistent to serve in dividing the typical Ostracions into genera. The 
most dissimilar forms are connected by others, intermediate in character, 
and a series of specimens in various stages of growth of a single species 
like 0. quadricornis or 0. concatenafus shows great age-variation both in 
shape of carai^ace and in size and distribution of spines. 

As has been remarked, Lacepede and Bleeker regarded the position of 
the spines as the most reliable character for classification. 

Hollard sniiis up his observations on the specimens in the Paris Mu- 
seum as follows : 

" The diversity of species at a first glance appears greater than it is 
in reality ; at least it is easy to reduce them to a small number of typi- 
cal forms. The true types are those based upon form. The absence, the 
presence, and the number of the spines, large or small, with which many 
of the Ostracionts are provided, aftbrd characters of very secondary and 
simply specific value. These spines in fact are present or absent with- 
out regard to more important characters. * * * They should be 
subordinated to other diiferences between which no known examples 
form connecting links.":j: 

Kaup and Swainson, on the other hand, adopted the form of the cara- 
pace as the most important character. This was considered by Hol- 
lard as of but little value for generic diagnosis, and by Bleeker is dis- 
posed of most summarily. " The triangular or quadrangular form of 
the body," he remarks, " appears to have no real value (for the separa- 
tion of genera) since it depends simply upon the greater or less con- 
vexity or elevation of the dorsal plane of the carapace. If, for example, 
we place an Ostracion triqueter, L., by the side of an Ostracion teiragonus, 
L. (= 0. cubicus), we have before us two well-marked types, one with a 
triangular the other with a quadrangular carapace [Ostracion, Kaup, 
and Cihotion, Kaui)). But if between these two extremes we place an 
Ostracion guineensis, Bllvr., and an Ostracion nasus, BL, we cannot decide 
whether "■we are dealing with a triangular or quadrangular form, for the 
dorsal surface is elevated in the shape of a roof, presenting two faces 
which descend from a central crest to unite at an obtuse angle with the

lateral walls of the carapace. It is evident, from the study of these 
transitious, that the form of the carapace caunot furnish a certain basis 
for the establishment of distinct genera. 

"The character of the spines has, however, a greater value than tliat 
of the form of the carapace. Although it be true that spines do not 
occur exclusively upon this or that form of carapace, since there are 
triangular Irunkflshes without spines, others armed with frontal and 
anal spines, and others with anal spines alone, while there are also 
quadrangular ones, spineless, or armed on the forehead and beneath the 
tail, still there may be observed a certain consistency in their arrange- 
ment as regards their position, their form, their number, and their di- 
rection. But this constancy does not extend to their persistency since 
some S])ines, or indeed all of them, are absorbed and disappear entirely 
in adult individuals of certain species. In this manner all the spines 
disappear with age in Ostracion concatenatus, and if one were disposed 
to see generic characters in its arming, three genera might be founded 
upon O.stracion stellifer, Bl., Schu. (in which the forehead, the dorsal 
keel, and the ventral ridge are spinous), Ostracion hicuspis, Blum., figured 
by A. Smith (which has only dorsal and ventral spines), and Ostracion 
concatenatus, Bl. (which has the carapace entirely spineless). In real- 
ity these species are merely nominal ; Ostracion stellatus and Ostracion 
hiciisjns being young individuals of the species of which 0. concatenatus 
is the adult. In one other species, Ostracion cornutus, Linn, (not Bloch), 
the spines in the middle of the lateral dorsal ridge, and those on the 
ventral ridge, decrease with age, and in the adult finally disappear. 
In other species the spines are much more constant, but their i)ropor- 
tions, very different in accordance with the age of the individual, render 
it sufficiently evident that they afford a character of very doubtful 
value. I should, however, note the fact that there is no known example 
of an Ostracion with horizontal frontal and anal spines in w^hich these 
spines disappear in adult age." 

As has already been stated, the subgenera adopted by Bleeker are 
founded solely upon the number and position of the spines. In Tetro- 
somus he ])laces one pentagonal species, but in Acantliostracion and 
Ostracion he includes triagonal, tetragonal, and pentagonal forms with- 
out discrimination. Notwithstanding the strong grounds taken by him 
in regard to the importance of the shape of the carapace it seems to 
afford the most reliable guide in an arrangement of the species of this 
genus. An arrangement Avith reference to the position of the spines 
produces some incongruous results, while the other plan harmonizes to 
a great extent with all structural features as well as with the geograph- 
ical distribution of the group. Hollard remarked that the serial grada- 
tion of the species was of great interest, but he did not work it out 
with the care which might have been expected. I have endeavored to 
indicate what seems to me to be a natural series, from the triagonal 
spineless form through the pentagonal form, provided with many spines, 
to the tetragonal spineless form at the other extreme.

Serial arrangement of the species of Ostracion. 

I. Form triagoual, spineless <^>- ^queter. 

11. Form triagonal, with two ventral spines 0. irigonus, 0. hicamlalis. 

III. a. Form triagonal, with two ventral and two horizontal frontal spines, the 

posterior extension of whose base gives in young individuals a semblance to 

a tetragonal, in adults to a pentagonal shape 0. qnairicornis. 

h. Lik-e the last in every respect except that there is a median dorsal spine. 
(This is frequently seen in the young of 0. qmdricornis, disappearing at 
different stages of growth in different individuals, hut in others persist- 
gjj|\ 0. quadricornis, subspecies notacanthus. 

IV. a. Form subtriagonal, approaching to pentagonal, the posterior extension of the 

orbital crest being more pronounced than in III. Frontal spines smaU, 
vertical, frequently double, two small spines upon the dorsal ridge and two 
on each ventral keel, all the spines obsolescent with age. . . . 0. concatenatus. 
b. (Aside-shoot from a.) Like the last, but with all characters exaggerated 
and more persistent, the dorsal spine single and high, the spines on each 
lateral keel four in number. 

0. turrltus (by GUnther considered to bo probably identical with 0. con- 
catenatus). 

V. a. Form subtetragonal, approaching pentagonal, but with a dorsal surface 

clearly defined, though the affinity to the triagoual forms is indicated by a 
pronounced elevation of the dorsum, surmounted by a high spine. Frontal 
spines horizontal, stronger. The fullness of the anterior part of the body 
observed in the forms already studied is suggested by a bulging of the 

ventral surface 0. Fornastni, 0. cornutus, Linn. =0. dlaplianus, Schn. 

In 0. diaphamis the dorsal surface is flatter than in 0. Foniasini, but there 
are small spines on the dorsal and ventral keels, obsolescent in age, which 
suggest the preceding form. The two forms together, or an average between 
them, form a needed link in the series. 
h. (A side-shoot with great development of frontal and ventral spines.) Forms 
similar to the last but approximating still more closely to the tetragonal, 
particularly in adult age ; without dorsal spine, though with a trace of its 
presence in an elevated dorsal ridge. Horizontal spines very prominent. 

0. arciis, Schn. = 0. cornutus, Bloch. 

VI. Form tetragonal, spineless, similar to the last, but with squarer angles. "A 

more or less sharp protuberance in front of the dorsal tin, from which several 
pointed lines radiate." Horizontal spines absent. This is the transition 
from the subpeutagonal and subtetragonal to the truly tetragonal forms. 

0. ornatus. 
VII. a. Form tetragonal, spineless, similar to the last, but with lower though still 

very distinct dorsal ridge, A trace of rostral prominence 0. rmsus. 

h. (Side-shoot from a.) Similar to a, but with prominent rostral hump. 

0. rhinorhynchus. 
c. Form truly tetragonal, back convex, not ridged, dorsal and ventral keels 

blunt . . .' r. 0. cuMcus, 0. punctatiis, 0. sehcp. 

VIII. Form tetragonal, spineless, back flat, ridges sharp 0. Benardl, O. solorensis. 

Such is the continuity of the gradation in this series that it is ahnost 
impossible to distribute the species into subgenera, though the extreme 
forms wouhl be considered by many writers as belonging to well-marked 
genera were the hitermediate forms not known. The transition is pe;r- 
fect, without a break from 0. triqueter to 0. Eenardi and 0. solorensis. 
Even the size, abundance, tfnd distribution of the spines are seen to be 
correlated to the shape of the body, for these are to be regarded, as

was suggested by Hollard, merely as exaggerations of the crests aud 
ridges which define the lateral, dorsal, and ventral surfaces of the caraT 
pace, occurring in those parts of the body and in that part of the above 
series where these crests aud ridges are most emi)hasized, and their ab- 
sence coinciding with the absence of prominent lines of demarcation. 
They are most numerous in the middle portion of the above series, in 
the forms transitional between the triagonal and tetragonal sections of 
the genus, and are alike also at both extremes. 

The geographical distribution of the species is interesting in the light 
of this gradation. The triagonal forms (I and II) occur only in the West 
Indies. The next in order (III) occur not only in the West Indies but 
in the southeastern Atlantic. The subtriagoual form {IV) is represented 
in the southeastern Atlantic (at the Cape of Good Hope), in the west- 
ern Pacific (China), in Australia and the East Indian Archipelago. The 
subtetragonal forms (V) are represented in the Indian Ocean, west to 
the Cape of Good Hope, in Japan and Australia, and in the East Indian 
Archipelago, while the tetragonal forms (YI, VII, and YIII) almost ex- 
clusively in the Indian Archipelago and the Indian Ocean. 

There is no dearth of names for the sections of this group, but as has 
been remarked, it is impossible to assign them or subdivide the genus 
by any but arbitrary methods. 

Swainson's Ostracion corresponds to Divisions VI, VII, and VIII; 
his Tetrosomus to Divisions IV and V, although he assigns 0. cornutus 
to the following genus; his Lactophrys to Divisions II aud HI, aud his 
Ehinesomus to Division I. 

Kaup's Ostracion would include Divisions I, II, HI, and IV ; his Lac- 
tophrys, Division V; and his Cihotion, Divisions VI, VII, and VIII. 
Bleeker's Ostracion includes I, VI, VII, aud VIII; his Tetrosomus, IV; 
his Acanthostracion, II, HI, and V. 

Dr. Bleeker by assuming Division V, instead of Division I, as one ex- 
treme of the series, made his division of the group into subgenera more 
plausible. This arrangement does not, however, allow as com2)lete a 
gradation of form.

Color : The color of living individuals is thus recorded in ray Bermuda 
note-book: — "Dark-brown, thickly studded with circular spots of yel- 
lowish white, each about two lines in diameter ; the position of these spots 
appears to have no relation to the shape of the plates of the carapace. 
Ventral surface lighter and spotless. The epidermis is often abraded 
leaving the shell uniform tawny-white. The lips, bases of the fins, and 
tail-stem are brown like the ground color of the body." In dried speci- 
mens the epidermis dries and loses its color, and the shell shows through 
with a lighter shade. Giinther states that the lips, roots of the tins, 
root of the tail, and tip of the caudal are black. * This I have not ob- 
served. 

The largest individuals seen by me measured about 205 millimetres 
in length, but these were quite unusual in size. 

The Cuckold is common throughout the West Indies, and has been 
found south to Bahia, while, to the north, it is carried by the Gulf 
Stream as far as the Bermudas. Its limits of distribution are more 
closely restricted to the Caribbean Sea and the neighboring waters than 
those of any other species in the genus. 

It is recorded that the crew of Columbus, on their first voyage, in 
1492, while at anchor on the coast of Cuba, captiu-ed a fish which "was 
like a swine, all covered with a very hard skin, no part whereof was soft 
but the tail," which was probably one of the Ostracious. 

Little can be said in reference to its habits, except that it is sluggish 
and lives close to the bottom, where it probably feeds ni^on hydroids 
ascidians, and other soft-bodied animals. This is somewhat conjectural 
for no one has ever taken the pains to examine the stomach contents of 
any member of the genus, but it is not very hazardous to make this sur- 
mise, for the sluggish movements of the Trunk-fish would not permit it 
to pursue active living prey, while its small, weak teeth are thoroughlj- 
unsuitable for feeding upon shells and barnacles. 

The method of locomotion in this and other members of the genus 
Ostracion is very ijeculiar. When in Bermuda, in 1872, I had two of 
them for a time in my aquarium, and had an excellent opportunity of 
observing the movements of their fins. 

The rigid shell prevents any flexure of the body, the only parts with 
l)Ower of independent motion being the lips, the dorsal and aual fins, 
and the stem of the tail. These protrude through openings in the cara-

pace, and the bases of the fins as weU as the lips are eucased in tough 
skin, leathery and flexible. Even the gill-openings are Incapable of inde- 
pendent motion, for they are only straight, narrow, vertical slits in the 
carapace just in front of the pectoral fins. 

The sinuous muscular movement of the posterior half or two-thirds 
of the body, which plays so important a part in the movement of the 
ordinary fish, is of course impossible, and the rotary, sculling motion 
so noticeable in the caudal fin of a fish, like a minnow or a trout, seems 
equally unknown. The power of propulsion appears to be vested 
chiefly in the dorsal and anal fins. These are broad and round, pro- 
vided apparently with strong muscles, and the anal is placed almost 
directly beneath the dorsal. When the fish moves it is solely by the 
eftect of a strong, slow, regular half-rotary movement of these two ver- 
tical fins, much resembling that of the screw-wheel of a propeller-en- 
gine. The caudal fin is kept vertical, and, moved from side to side, plays 
the part of a rudder, except when needed for an unusually rapid move- 
ment, and then it adds its strength with long, strenuous side-strokes. 
There are no ventral fins, nor do they seem to be needed, for the fish is 
balanced upon its centre of gravity and well under the control of its 
propulsive fins. The pectorals probably perform a certain part in 
balancing, but seem to be most useful in keeping up a circulating cur- 
rent through the gill-apertures. 

Their movements are sluggish, and they do not seem to require a 
rapid aeration of the blood, for I have known them to live for two or 
three hours out of water, and when restored seem none the worse for 
the change of element, save that for a time they were prevented from 
sinking to the bottom by the air which they had swallowed and which 
kept them awkwardly suspended at the surface. 

I have rarely seen them swimming among the reefs. They appear 
to spend most of the time resting on the bottom, on the broad nether 
surface of the carapace. They never take the hook, but often enter 
the fish-pots set at a depth of two to ten fathoms. 

Ko one has been so fortunate as to observe the breeding habits of the 
Ostracions ; even the time of spawning is unknown. 

In the Bermudas they are sometimes eaten, though not held in high 
estimation. I was unable to learn that evil effects ever follow their use 
for food at this locality. Hollard states that its flesh is said to be pal- 
atable and wholesome, but cites no authority for this observation, 
which is probably taken second-hand from Lacepede, who gives an en- 
thusiastic eulogy of its good qualities. "Its flesh," wrote the fluent 
Gaul, "is more sought after than that of almost any other fish in the 
seas of America where it makes its home." And then he continued 
with a most amusing proposition for acclimating the species in the 
waters of France, and which is a good example of the theories of the 
would-be fish-culturists of eighty years ago. "Although it appears to 
thrive only in tro])ical regions we might endeavor to acclimate it in

waters more remotci liora the equator, since the differences of teini)era- 
ture presented by the water at different decrees of hititude are far less 
marked than those of the atmosphere. On the one liand we know with 
what facility fishes found only in the sea can be habituated to life iu 
fresh water. The exquisite flavor and exceedingly wholesome nature 
of tlie flesh of the 'trianoulaire' should encourage us to make persever- 
ing and well considered experiments in this direction ; we might accom- 
plish this acclimation, Avhich would be imi)ortant from more than one 
point of view, by gradual steps ; we should gradually accaistom the 
species to temperatures successively less warm ; we should even con- 
tinue the experiment through many gener.itions of the animal before 
abandoning it com])letely, without artificial i)rotection, to the climate in 
which it is to be naturalized. We should do lor the 'triangulaire' what 
has been done for many species of plants; we should bring individuals 
of this species, and we should care for them through a long period in 
water, which we should keep at a temperature closely resembling that 
of the equatorial seas iu their surface strata; then we should lower the 
temperature of the little i)ools in which the 'triangulaires' are kept by 
almost insensible degrees and by very geutle variations. In the regions 
of Euro])e and other parts of the globe, far removed from the tropics, 
where the thermal currents flow, we might at least profit by these 
naturally heated waters to give to the triangulaires that degree of heat 
which is to them absolutely necessary, or to accustom them by insensi- 
ble degrees to endnring the ordinary temperature of the fresh waters 
or of the seas of those various regions." — (Lacepede, 1. c.)

The Brown-spotted Trunk-fish has a wider distribution to the south 
than the Cuckold, having been recorded by Dr. Giinther from the Island 
of Ascension, where a young individual was taken by Mr. J. Eobinson. 
It is also in Mr. Osbert Salvin's Honduras collections. It has not yet 
been recorded from the coast of Florida, or to the north of Cuba. 

It attains a much larger size than the preceding. HoUard gives the 
following dimensions for one of the largest in the Museum d'llistoire 
Naturelle : 

M.

The Trunk-fishes appear to ha^e been objects of curiosity in the early 
days of American exploration, and were evidently among the choicest 
treasures of the primitive museums of the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. Their strange shapes naturally attracted the attention of 
travellers, and then, as now, the ease with which their shells could be 
preserved made them fa\'orites of curiosity hunters. No group of trop- 
ical fishes is so thoroughly worked out in the writings of "the fathers" 
as the Plectognaths, and none more so than the Ostracions. Over two 
hundred years ago every species of Ostracion now known from the 
western Atlantic had been named and described by the naturalists of 
northern Europe, and it is a well-deserved tribute to their discrimina- 
tion as zoologists to say that none of the many eftbrts which have since 
been made to subdivide these species have been at all successful. 

Artedi in his notes upon the different forms of Ostracion mentions 
the various collections in which he observed specimens. The "Naggs' 
head," "White Bear," and the "Green Dragon in Stepney," to which he 
very often alludes, seem to have been London taverns where cmiosities 
were kept. He also speaks of seeing them in the museum of Hans 
Sloane, the nucleus of the British Museum ; also in the collections of D.

Seba, in Amsterdam, of Mr. Lillja, in Loudou, of Mr. (Don) Saltcros, in 
Chelsey, and of seeing various specimens at Stratford, and "in spring- 
garden." No otlier kinds of lislies appear to have been preserved 
except " the monli- or Angel-fish Anglis, aliis Mermaid fiah,''^ probably a 
species of Squatinu, which he saw in London at the Naggshead and 
in the town of Chelsey. The art of taxidermy was evidently not 
thoroughly established in 1738. 

Of Ostraeion hlcaudalis, he remarks, "Vidi Loiidiui, in the White 
Bear," and "Apud D'" Sebam vidi." Ostraeion trigonus he saw "Apud 
Sir Hans Sloane et in ]S"aggshead"; Ostraeion friqiieter and 0. qiiadri- 
cornis, "Londiui in the ISTaggshead et apud Mr. Lillia." 

The speciaieus were all said to have come from India.

spine on eacli abdominal ridge, which i.s itself sharp and prominent. 

Hollard claims that Ostracion trigonus is one of the largest, if not the 
largest, as was claimed" by Artedi,* of the triangular species, and gives 
the following measurements of one of the specimens studied by him : 

M. 

Total leugth 0.4C0 

Greatest height 0. 150 

Greatest width (in abclomiual region) 0. 135 

Length of cephalic region 0.180 

Length of tail-stem 0.100 

Caudal 0.060 

Largest diameter of lateral scutes 0.028 

The largest specimen obtained by me in the Bermudas did not exceed 
350 millimetres in length. 

Linn fens in his Systema Naturw, edition tenth, atti'ibuted to this spe- 
cies Jburteen dorsal rays, an error which, as Hollard has pointed out, 
has been copied and recopied by ichthyological writers down to the 
present day. 

Kaup (1. c.) described the species anew under the name Ostracion 
oviceps. He appears not to have recognized any of the specimens 
studied by him as belonging to 0. trigomis, the characters of which 
were totally misapprehended by him. His description of 0. oviceps cor- 
responds to the characters of 0. trigonus,^ w^hile the radial formulae, the 
only characters given by him for 0. trigomis, are imaginary and do not 
ajiply to any fish known to exist. The formula for the dorsal perpetu- 
ates the Linntean error already referred to; that for the caudal was prob- 
ably made out from mutilated specimens. Hollard, who Avorked over 
the collections in the Paris ]Museum the j^ear subsequent to tlie i^ublica- 
tion of Kaup's Memoir, states that he found certain specimens of 0. 
trigomis which had been labeled with the name 0. oviceps by Dr. Kaup, 
while others precisely like them had been left with the identification 0. 
trigomis. This signifies little, however, for no good characters have 
ever been given for the jjroposed new species. 

The color of living individuals of Ostracion trigomis is a uniform brown, 
with numerous irregularly grouped whitish spots, more abundant on the 
caudal stem than elsewhere. The fins are lighter than the body. 
Young specimens have a subcircular blackish blotch upon the side be- 
hind the gill-opening. 

This species probably breeds in the Bermudas. I obtained three 
specimens ranging in length from 1 inch to 12 inches, though I was not 
so fortunate as to secure young of any other species of the genus.

Lac^pede and HoUard speak of the power of makiug audible sounds 
attributed to this species by travellers, and which had gained for it the 
name coclion de mer. I have never had one of them in captivity, but 
have often observed the same liabit in Ostracion triqueter, which utters 
frequent and audible grunting sounds when taken from the water. These 
sounds are similar to those made by several members of the family 
Tetrodontidt^, familiar to every collector of fishes on the Atlantic coast 
of the United States.

Ostracions, with triagoiial carapace approaching to j^eiitagonal form 
in adults, to tetragonal in young, by reason of extension of base of 
frontal spines, ventral surface plane, angles obtusely carinate, and with 
two ventral and two horizontal frontal spines. Color brown, yellow, 
blue or green, the centres of the scutes often lighter than the margins. 

The range of the Cow-fish is much more extended than that of any of 
the preceding species, including St. Helena, Guinea, the Cape of Good 
Hope, and Charleston, S. C. A specimen was obtained October 11, 1877, 
near Gwyn's Island, Chesai)eake Bay, by Mr. Otto Lugger. These local- 
lities are well authenticated, and the species is also claimed as a mem- 
ber of the fauna of the Indian Ocean. A sketch of Ostracion quadri- 
corne by Burkhardt, marked " Mobile, 1853," is in the Agassiz collection. 
The sketch is also endorsed with a memorandum to the effect that a speci- 
men from Florida was living in Aquarial Garden, Boston, 1860. 

Bleeker admits this species to the fauna of the Dutch East Indies, but 
states expressly that he has never found it, and that he follows the au- 
thority of Bennett and Raffles, and that it is uncertain whether it really 
inhabits the Indian Archipelago. 

I have never seen more than one species of this type, and the syn- 
onymy at the head of this notice expresses the views of the majority of 
ichthyologists as well as my own. It seems only faii", however, to quote 
the opinion of Di-. Bleeker. "It appears to me very evident," wrote 
he, "that there are at least five species of triangular (or rather pentag- 
onal) Ostracions with frontal and preanal spines. Of these this (0. 
quadricornis) is the one longest known, and may be easily distinguished 
by the nearly vertical i)rofile of the head as well as by the strong si)ine 
which terminates the postero-superior dorsal plate. The other species 
resembling quadricornis are Ostracion notacanthus, Bleeker, Ostracion tri- 
coniis, L. (= Ostracion mactdatus, Hollard), Ostracion GronorH, Bleeker, 
and Ostracion gui7ieensis, Bleeker, but none of these exhibits the re- 
markable character of the T)Ostero-superior dorsal angle developed into 
a spine. Ostracion notacanthus is characterized by the presence of a 



280 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

spine upon the dorsal crest, by its oblique profile, and by the hexagonal 
or irregular black ring with large yellowish centre which is plainly visi- 
ble upon each ])late of the back and the flanks ; while Ostracion Grono- 
vii is easily recognized by the greater length of the frontal and preanal 
spines, by the absence of the median dorsal spine, and by the very oblique 
profile of the snout. Ostracion tricornis, Linn., which appears to be 
identical with the species described by Hollard as Ostracion maculatus, 
is marked by its nearly vertical profile and by longitudinal brown bands 
upon the cheeks. Ostracion (juineensis is marked by the subvertical 
profile of 0. tricornis, but has cheeks without bands, and the plates of 
the carapace ornamented with a central ocella of pearl color or blue." 

The largest specimens, or the two types 0. quadricornis and " 0. macu- 
latus,^^ in the Paris Museum, had, according to Hollard, the following 
dimensions : 

O. quadricornis. O. maculatus. 
M. M. 

Total leugth 0.400 0.390 

Height 0.1.-)0* 0.1-20 

Cephalic region 0.063 0.050 

Tail-stem 0.060 0.080 

Caudal 0.080 0.080 

Abdomiual width 0.090 

The presence of plates upon the caudal peduncle is apparently acci- 
dental. They may possibly have some relation to sex, but certainly 
none to age. Out of fourteen specimens examined five had plates above 
and below, one had two above, and six had none. In none of the speci- 
mens can I distinguish traces of the spine in the middle of the dorsal 
ridge mentioned by Dr. Giiuther. The color of young* specimens is well 
described by Glinther ; the bands on the cheek are, however, of a bright 
blue. Adult specimens are colored in a rich bright blue or green, lighter 
in the centre of each hexagonal plate, giving the appearance of annular 
markings, which quickly vanishes after death. In some individuals the 
color is worn from the ridges of the carapace, leaving patches of light 
brown. Bleeker claimed for his species Ostracion notacantlms a pecuhar 
system of coloration, but it is in nowise different from that of the ordi- 
nary type of 0. quadricornis.] The largest specimens are 21 inches 
long. 

In the Bermudas the Cow-fish is, I was told, much esteemed for food, 
and is frequently baked whole in its shell. The popular name, like the 
Cuban "toro" and the Jamaican "cuckold," refers to the two horn-like 
supraorbital spines.

I cannot follow Dr. Giinther in accepting for this species the Linnaean 
name Ostradon gihhosus, since no description of this species was pub- 
lished by Linnaeus. The first intelligible description was that by 
Foskaol, and although the indirect references to the figures published 
by Johnston, Willughby, and others, render it probable that this was 
the fish referred to by Linnaeus, still there is no way of definitely ascer- 
taining the meaning.

This species surely has no just claim to a place in the fauna of the 
United States. 

De Kay inserted it in his work on the fishes of :N'ew York on very 
slight evidence. I quote the paragraph relating to the single specimen 
on which he based his description and figure : 

"I know nothing of the origin of this species, except that it is said to 
have been taken on the shore of Long Island. It is possibly the species 
named triqueter by l>r. Smith, and which he represents as 'inhabiting 
the vicinity of Long Island, New York, but rarely makes its appearance 
so far to the north as Massachusetts, unless driven on shore by the vio- 
lence of storms.' The triqueter of Artedi, however, has no spines. It 
bears n considerable resemblance to the 0. turritus of Forskaol, from 
the Red Sea ; but that species is (piadraugular." oj). cit. p. 342. 

There cau be little doubt that the fish in De Kay's possession was a 
dried specimen of 0. turritKs, probably from a Chinese insect box. 

Dr. Gilnther remarks that this species is "very closely allied to and 
probably identical with 0. gihbosus^^ (viii, p. 250), but in his diagnosis 
he does not refer to any specimens intermediate in form between the 
two typical forms.

OI\ THE HABITS OF THE RO€K¥ ITIOIJNTAIIV OOAT. 

By I>R. JAMES C. MERRILL, U. S. A. 

Fort Shaw, Montana, October 21, 1879. 
Professor S. F. Baird, 

My Dear Sir : Since I last wrote to you I have passed two months 
at Fort Missoula, on the eastern limit of the Bitter-Eoot Eange, and 
while there, finding that the wild goat was comparatively abundant, I 
made several attempts to obtain a skin and skeleton for the Smith- 
sonian. I hunted them myself for two weeks, but unsuccessfully, only 
seeing one, and that I did not obtain. At that season they are in the 
highest and roughest peaks near and among snow, but in the winter 
come down to the lower slopes and valleys. 

You may be interested in the following items concerning this species, 
which I obtained from trustworthy sources : 

Accounts vary as to the rutting season and time of dropping the kids, 
but agree in the latter being two in number. During the summer the 
male, female, and kids keep together and until the appearance of the 
next young, though during the winter two or three of these fiimilies 
unite. At this season it is unusual to see more than a dozen together, 
though large bands are said to have been seen. The goats in all their 
movements are heavy and slow. They are most successfully hunted with 
dogs ; when started by them they generally climb up the nearest rock 
and stand them ofit'; and while so doing are easily approached and shot. 
When wounded and in close quarters they are rather dangerous, and 
are apt to use their horns with effect. They feed at sunrise and sunset, 
passing the day on some smooth flat rock in the sun, from which they 
can keep a good lookout, but rarely start until closely approached. 
The one I saw was among large masses of rock above snow-line. He 
got up within thirty yards of me, stood in full view for a moment, and 
then walked slowly off, almost hidden by the rocks. At first, though 
so near, I took him for an albino bear (and several old hunters told me 
they had made the same mistake! !) ; his large size, slow, heavy move- 
ments, and manner of looking back over the shoulder, with the absence 
of fear, being very different from my j)reconceived notions of the " white 



284 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

goat." I very soon saw 1113- error, but not liking to risk a snap shot, 
tried to head the animal off, but without success. The tracks are enor- 
mous for the size of the animal. I found many of their dusting places. 
The earth is pawed up until quite a depression is formed, in which they 
roll and lie by the hoitr. They are somewhat like those of the bighorn, 
but the numerous very long white hairs left in the dust show the 
presence of the goat. I spoke to my guide (Charles McWhirk, Corval- 
Es, near Missoula, Montana,) about getting some skins and skeletons 
this winter, and he said he would do so if any one "made it worth his 
while." If you desire them I think you had better write to him per- 
sonally about it. I tried to explain to him how the skins should be 
prepared. According to the recent order of the War Department he 
can turn them over to the quartermaster at Fort Missoula, forty-five 
miles distant, for shipment to the National Museum. 

This account is not so complete as I could wish, but I send it as bet- 
ter than none, as the goat is so little known. What I have written ap- 
phes to their habits in the Bitter-Koot Eange. They are also found 
rather plentifully in the main range of the Eockies near Flathead Lake. 
Several have been caught alive, and the Indians sometimes bring in the 
kids, but the latter soon die. 

Nothing of special ornithological interest here now, but the winter 
fauna in this latitude will be worthy of §tudy. 
Very truly, yours, 

JAMES C. MEREILL. 



IVOTES OIV A COLiIiECTIOIV OF FISHES FROITI EASTER'V OEOROIA. 

By TARLETOiV H. BEAIV. 

The United States National Museum received, December 15, 1879, from 
Mr. A. Graves, postmaster at McBean, Ga., five species of fresh-water 
fishes, one of which is here described as new to science. Mr. Graves 
writes that the fishes were collected in McBean Creek, which " is the 
dividing line between Burke and Eichmond Counties, and is within two 
hundred yards of McBean Station, on Augusta and Savannah Eailroad. 
It empties into the Savannah Eiver, about seven miles from this sta- 
tion." The local names are those transmitted by Mr. Graves. The 
species of Centrarchidcv have all been previously recorded by Prof D. S. 
Jordan, from Georgia.

The greatest height of the body equals the length of the longest 
dorsal ray; it is slightly less than the length of the head, and is con- 
tained in the length of body, without caudal, 5 times. The length of 
the head is contained 4 to 4.^ times in the same. In specimen 23513 a 
the length of the pectoral equals the greatest height of the body; in 
specimen 235136 it equals the length of the head without the snout. 
The long diameter of the eye equals J- of the length of the head. The 
length of the ventral is contained 6 to 6.J times in length of body with- 
out caudal. The distance of the origin of the dorsal from the snout 
equals twice the length of the head, and equals the distance of the 
ventral from the snout. The longest anal ray equals in length the 
longest ventral ray. The length of the anal basis equals ^ the greatest 
height of the body. The length of the upper jaw equals the short

following the course of the lateral line and continued around the nose, 
most distinct in the young specimen.

sion, on the 8th of November, 1879, a Catfish which weighed 150 pounds 
at the time of shipment. After comparing this with the other described 
species of Aminrus I am unable to identify it with any of them. The 
most distinguishing character of the species is its many-rayed anal, in 
which it resembles Ichthcclurus rather than Amiurus, though it has the 
skull-structure of the latter. 

The specimen Avhich forms the tyi^e of the present description was 
sent at the recpiest of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, United States Commis- 
sioner of Fish and Fisheries, to whom Dr. Steedman wrote the follow- 
ing information : "Your letter requesting the shipment to you of a large 
Mississippi Catfish Avas received this morniug. T'pon visiting our 
market this P. M. I luckily found two— one of 144 lbs., the other 150 
lbs. The latter I shi]) to you to-night by express, ... 1 purchased 
it from an old fish-dealer of 30 years' experience in our market -, and he 
assures me that the largest Mississippi Catfish he has met in that time 
weighed 198 pounds. (He says he has heard of Cattish weighing 250 
and 300 pounds, but he does not believe the stories.) This is the only 
variety, he says, which reaches 100 lbs. There is another species which 
sometimes attains 05 lbs. in weight. My informant (and he is practical 
authority among us) enumerates six well-marked varieties of Catfish in 
the Mississippi waters " 

The admission of this s]iecies into the genus Amiurus Avill necessitate 
a modification of the definition of the genus so far as the limits of varia- 
tion in the anal rays are concerned; and will leave only the lack of con- 
tiguity between the suj)ra-occipital and the second interspinal to dis- 
tinguish Amiurus from Ichthcvlurus. A plaster cast and the skeleton of 
the type are preserved. 

Description.— The catalogue number of the type is 23388; its 
length, to the origin of the middle caudal rays, is 57.2 inches, to the end 
of the same rays, 61 inches. The distance from the middle of the base 
of the caudal to the end of the upper caudal lobe is 8 inches. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 287 

The shape of the body resembles that of A. nigricans; the caudal, 
however, is emargiuate and not deeply forked as in that species. 

In the description and table of measurements the length of body is 
to be understood to mean the length to the origin of the middle caudal 
rays — 57.2 inches. 

The greatest height of the body (.29) is contained 3. J times in its 
length, and equals twice the length of the external caudal rays (.14). 
Its greatest width (.18) is contained 5i times in length of body, and 
equals § of the length of the head (.27). The height of the body at the 
ventrals (.29) equals the greatest height. The least height of the tail 
(.084) equals the length of the snont (.084), which is contained 3J times 
in the length of the head. The length of the caudal peduncle (.16) 
equals twice its least height. 

The length of the head (.27) is contained 2§ times in length of body, 
and equals 3 times that of the ventral (.09). The width of the mouth 
(.168) equals twice the length of the snout (.084), and is contained 6 
times in length of body. The extent of the intermaxillary band of 
teeth (.106) nearly equals the distance from the snout to the orbit (.108). 
The greatest width of the head (.22) equals | of its greatest length. 
The distance between the eyes (.15) is slightly more than half the length 
of the head, and equals the length of the mandible (.15). The length of 
the intermaxillary (.108) equals the distance from the snout to the orbit 
(.108), and is contained 2i times in the length of the head. The length 
of the maxillary barbel of the right side (.16) equals that of the caudal 
peduncle, and nearly equals the width of the mouth. The remaining 
barbels except the nasal are too imperfect to admit of description. The 
distance from the lower nostril to the eye (.06) equals 4 times the long 
diameter of the eye (.015). The distance from the ux)per nostril to the 
eye (.056) is contained slightly more than 4 J times in the length of the 
head. 

The distance of the fir.st dorsal from the snout (.365) is contained 2| 
times in length of body, and equals 3 times the length of its first ray 
(.122). The length of the first dorsal base (.082) nearly equals that of 
the snout. The length of the dorsal spine (.105) is contained 2J times 
in that of the head. The length of the last dorsal ray (.05) equals ^ of 
the distance between the eyes. 

The distance of the adipose dorsal from the snout (.81) equals nearly 
3 times the length of the head. Its length of base (.043) is contained 
6 times in the distance of the pectoral from the snout (.20). Its greatest 
height (.06) equals the distance between the lower nostril and the eye 
(.06), and is contained 4| times in the length of the head. 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.67) is contained IJ times in 
length of body, and equals 3 times the greatest width of the head ; its 
distance from the anus (.035) is contained 3 times in the length of the 
dorsal spine, and 8 times in that of the head. The length of the anal 
base (.26) equals the distance of the pectoral from the snout (.26), and 



288 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

is contained 3f times in length of body. The length of the first anal 
ray (.01) is contained 8 times in the least height of tail. The ninth and 
longest anal ray (.077) is nearly as long as the base of the first dorsal 
(.08). The length of the last anal ray (.()3;3) eqnals ^ that of the middle 
caudal rays (.OGG), which is contained 15 times in the length of body. 

The proportion between the middle and external caudal rays (.14) is 
as 34- to 8, both being measured from the middle of the origin of the 
middle caudal rays. The length of the external caudal rays is contained 
7 times, and of the middle caudal rays, 15 times in the length of body. 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.26) is somewhat more 
than twice the length of the pectoral (.125). 

The distance of the ventral from the snout (.56) equals 4 times the 
length of the external caudal rays. The length of the ventral eqnals ^ 
of the length of the head and -jL of the length of body. 

Badial formula: B. VIII; D. II, 6; A. Ill, 32; P. I, 11; V. I, 7. 

Color: — Upper part of body and head bluish slate; lower parts 
whitish. 

The length of the ovaries is 17 inches, and the weight 5 pounds avoir- 
dupois. The diameter of the eggs is from -^ to -^ of an inch. They 
are not readily separable and are apparently far from maturity. 

Amiurus imnderosus differs considerably from A. nigricans as will be 
seen in the measurement tables. A. ponderosus has (1) a deeper body ; 
(2) a much wider mouth ; (3) a wider interorbital space ; (4) the inter- 
maxillary and the intermaxillary baud of teeth longer ; (5) the maxillary 
barbel only § as long as the head instead of f as in nigricans; (6) the 
long diameter of the eye contained 17^ times in the length of the head 
instead of 9 to 11 as in nigricans; (7) the first ray of the dorsal less 
than ^ as long as the head ; (8) the longest anal ray less than ^ as long 
as the head ; (9) the caudal rays shorter and the caudal not forked ; (10) 
the pectoral considerably less than h as long as the head (more than ^ 
in A. nigricans)', (11) the ventral contained 3 times in length of head 
(24 in A. nigricans) ; (12) anal rays, III, 32.

PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 291 
NOTE OIV EIVDOTIIY^RA ORIVATA. 

By C. A. WHITE. 

Among the fossils obtained by Prof. O. St. John from the Carbonifer- 
ous strata of the region of the T6ton Mountains, southward from the 
Yellowstone National Park, are some fragments of a dark silicious lime- 
stone, adhering to the weathered surfaces of which are some small glob- 
ular foraminifera. ISTone of them are in an entirely satisfactory con- 
dition of preservation, but their internal structure is very well shown. 
in some cases. Samples of these objects have been submitted to Mr. 
Henry B. Brady, F. E. S., whose labors with the foraminifera are so well 
known. He mentions in reply the difficulty of being absolutely sure in 
the determination of weathered specimens, but still thinks, without any 
doubt, they are samples of Endothyra ornata Brady. (See Brady's 
Monog. Garb, and Perm. Foram. p. 99, pi. vi, flgs. 1-4.) The discovery 
of this form in that far- western region is interesting since it has hith- 
erto been found only in England, Ireland, and Scotland. Another form 
of Endothyra, however, E. baileiji {=RotaUa haileyi Hall) is found in the 
lower Carboniferous strata of Indiana. 



NOTE ON CRIOCARDltJITI AND ETHJYIOCARRIUiTI. 
By C. A. ^VHITE. 

The subgenus Criocardium was proposed by Conrad to receive the 
shells of that section of the genus Cardium which bear spines upon the 
interspaces between the ribs. Besides the type indicated by him (C. 
dumosum) which has "long slender spines between the ribs," there are 
several European forms which are plainly referable to this section, among 
which are G. productum Sowerby ; C. nioutoniamm d'Orb., and G. caroli- 
num d'Orb. All these shells have distinct spines or tubercles, or both, 
occupying all the interspaces between the ribs ; those upon the anterior 
and posterior i^ortions of the valves being longer and more conspicuous 
than those upon the middle portion. 

In adopting this subgenus Mr. Meek (U. S, Geol. Sur. Terr. vol. ix, 
4to ser., p. 169) referred to Griocardium the Gardium speciosum of Meek 
& Hayden, supposing it to bear spines or tubercles upon its intercostal 
spaces. In the An. Eep. U. S. Geol. Sur. Terr, for 1877, p. 183, I took 
occasion to state that among numerous examples of this shell which I 
had examined, no trace of either spines or nodes was detected, but that 
in place of them the test was perforated with minute holes. Subsequent 
examination of portions of the shell of authentic examples, having the 
natural surface in a better state of preservation than any before exam- 
ined, shows that tliese small perforations are perfect apertures through 
the whole substance of the test, the border of each one being distinctly 



292 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

defined upon botli the inner and outer surface ; the margin of the aper- 
tures not being- even everted or raised upon the outer surface. More- 
over, these perforations exist upon the middle portion of the valve only, 
the greater part of the rows extending from the umbo to the basal border. 
In the young state, as shown on the umbo of adult shells, a lesser part 
of the median interspaces were thus perforated, but as the shell grew 
perforations were introduced into the next outer adjoining interspaces, 
so that fully one half of the surface of the adult shell was occupied by 
them. Both the anterior and posterior portions of the sm^fiice, compris- 
ing a considerable proportion of the ribs which mark the surface, are 
entirely without either holes or spines, and besides the ribs, the surface 
is marked only by the ordinary lines and imbrications of growth. 

This shell therefore differs from the typical forms of Criocardium in 
having perforations only instead of spines or nodes upon the intercostal 
interspaces ; and in having neither spines nor perforations upon either 
the anterior or posterior portions of the valves, upon which portions in. 
Criocardium the spines are more conspicuous than upon the median por- 
tion. These differences from Criocardium are certainly as great as those 
which separate any of the other recognized subgenera of Cardium, and 
this shell is therefore as worthy as they of subgeneric designation. I 
therefore propose for a section of the genus Cardium, of which C. specie- 
sum Meek & Hay den is the type, the subgeneric name of Etimiocardium, 

Washington, December 2, 1879. 



DESCRIPTIOIVS OF NEW CKETACEOU8 IIVVERTEBKATE FOS$9ICi8 
FROM ICAIVSAS AJSn TEXAS. 

By C. A. TIHITE. 

Of the fossils described in this paper the two Aviculids were discov- 
ered by Prof. B. F. Mudge,* in strata of the Dakota Group, in Saline 
County, Kansas, and sent by him to the National Museum. The locality 
of these fossils is only about three miles distant from that at which he 
obtained a series of fossils which were described and figured in vol. ix, 
IT. S. Geol. Surv. Terr. (4to ser.). They are all from the Dakota Group, 
and all evidently from the same local horizon, because at least two of 
the associated species are identical with two which were among those 
described by Mr. Meek, and just referred to. 

All the remainder are from Texas, having been sent respectively by 
Mr. G. W. Marnoch, from Bexar County ; Mr. D. H. Walker from Bell 
County, and Mr. S. W. Black, from Collin County. The types of all 
these species are now in the collections of the iSTational Museum. 

* While these pages are passing through the press the sad iutelligeuce comes that 
Professor Mudge is dead. He was a sincere devotee iiud an intelligent interpreter of 
nature, and, better still, an honest man. Peace to liis ashes.— C. A. W.

MOLLUSCA. 

Genus OSTEEA Liuuaeius. 

Subgenus Alectryonia Fischer. 

Ostrea (Alectryonia) blackii (sp. nov.). Plate 4, figs. 1 and 2. 

Shell irregularly subovate in marginal outline, moderatelj'^ capacious, 
beaks small, sometimes obscure and sometimes moderately prominent. 
Lower valve usually moderately deep and capacious, its convexity being 
more prominent about the middle than elsewhere, often snbalate, but 
this latter feature is usually obscure ; scar of attachment at the beak 
usually present and often moderately large; ligament-area usually short 
and rather small, but sometimes comparatively large and laterally ex- 
tended; ligament-furrow well defined and having the usual (;haracter- 
istics of the genus. Upper valve nearly flat and corresponding with the 
lower in other respects, except that it is not so broad along the hinge-bor- 
der and never has there the subalations which sometimes mark the lower 
valve. The a<lductor scars are moderately large and have the form com- 
mon to Alectryonia, namely, curved-spatnlate. Surface of both valves 
marked by concentric lines and strong imbrications of growth, and each 
by a dozen or more radiating ribs or plications, which constitute a con- 
spicuous feature of the shell ; but they are usually somewhat less dis- 
tinct upon the upper than upon the under valve. 

Length, 68 u 
32 millimeters. 

In form and general aspect this shell approaches that of a typical 
Ostrea; but in the character of its adductor scars, the extent of its plica- 
tions, and the subalation of its cardinal border it is properly referable 
to Alectryonia. The only shell with which it need be compared is 0. 
hellaplicata Shumard, also from Texas. It differs from that shell in 
being constantly larger, proportionally less capacious, broader toward 
the base, and in having its hinge-border longer and more oblique. 

Position and locality. — Cretaceous strata, Collin County, Texas, where 
it was collected by Mr. S. W. Black, and sent by him to the Smith- 
sonian Institution. The specific name is given in his honor. 

Genus EXOGYEA Say. 

Exogyra forniculata (sp. uov.). Plate 4, figs. 3 and 4. 

Shell subtrihedral in lateral outline, somewhat compressed vertically. 
Under, or left valve thick, especially its umbonal half; beak curved 
strongly toward the posterior border, and in the plane of the free mar- 
gins of the valve, not forming so much as one complete volution, its 
point being free but closely approaching the posterior border of the 
valve; ligament-area irregularly triangular, moderately large, extend- 
ing to the apex of the beak, its sulcus well developed; interior surface

having the usual characteristics of the genus. A faint, illy-definecl sul- 
cus is apparent on the posterior side, extending from the umbo to the 
basal border, between which sulcus and the laterally flattened-concave 
posterior border of the va.lre there is an equally indefined radiating 
curved ridge. The anterior portion of the valve is marked by a strong 
angular, rough carina or rid.q;^ which extends from the beak to the basal 
border. The prominence of this ridge gives a flattened aspect to the 
outer surface of the valve, and also produces a flattened space of con- 
siderable width between it and the anterior margin. Surface marked 
by the ordinary coarse lines of growth, often presenting the coarse 
imbrications so common to the Ostreidw; and upon the ridges just 
described there are occasional nodes or vaulted projections of portions 
of the shell. Upper valve unknown. 

Length, 70 millimeters; breadth across near the base, where it is 
broadest, 50 millimeters. 

In general aspect this shell is much like a Gryphwa, but it is referred 
to Exogyra because of its laterally instead of perpendicularly curved 
umbo and beak. This species therefore affords additional evidence of 
the well-known fact that the two genera named approach each other very 
closely. Specifically this shell is well marked by its strong, rough angu- 
lar carina, its free beak, narrow umboual region and broad base. la 
these respects it differs too much from any described form to need de- 
tailed comparison. By casual observation it may be mistaken for the 
variety navia Conrad, of Grypliiea pltcheri ; but a comparison of the 
beaks of the two forms will show a well-marked difference. 

Position and locality. — Cretaceous strata, Bexar County, Texas, where 
it was collected by G. W. Marnoch, esq., together with many well-known 
Cretaceous species of that region. 

Exogyra vT-inchelli (sp. uov.)- Plate 2, figs. 1 uud 2; ami plate 3, figs. 1 aud :2. 

Shell of medium size, irregularly subovate in marginal outline; ses- 
sile, or attached by a large part of the surface of the lower or left valve, 
being oblicjuely inclined so that the anterior border is very much higher 
than the posterior. Lower valve massive, moderately deep, its front 
side nearly perpendicular and of considerable height vertically; umbo 
vertically flattened continuously with the front side, and broadly curving 
backward ; beak closely incurved under the posterior border and there 
concealed; ligamental groove long and narrow, occupying the whole 
curvatiu-e of the umbo. Upper valve nearly flat, thick; the anterior 
part being much thicker than the posterior; beak vertically thin or 
compressed, closely coded in a plane with that of the valve, making a 
little more than one entire volution. Surface marked by coarse lines of 
growth, and near the anterior borders of both valves, especially the 
upper, it is usually deeply laciniate. 

Length, 90 millimeters; breadth, G6 millimeters: height in front, 55 
millimeters. 

This species belongs to the same section of the genus Exogyra with 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 295 

E. haUotoidea Sowerby, sp., and E. walkeri White. The latter species 
is larger and proportionally broader than U. ivmchelU, and not properly 
sessile as the latter species is. U. haUotoidea, as figured by d'Orbigny 
in Pal. Frangaise, t. iii, pi. 478, differs from JEJ. winchelU in being pro- 
portionately higher in front and narrower in transverse diameter, and 
in not having the beaks so much incurved. U. interrupta Conrad, from 
Mississippi, also belongs to the same section, but that species is de- 
scribed as having radiating ribs, which ours has not. 

Positio)! and loeality. — Cretaceous strata, Collin County, Texas, where 
it was collected and sent to the Smithsonian Institution by Mr. S. W. 
Black. The collections of the Institution also contain a tine example 
sent by Prof. A. Winchell many years ago from Prairie Bluffs, Ala., 
which is believed to be specifically identical with the form here described, 
but is proportionally more elongate, has a larger muscular scar, and the 
umbonal curve is a little more abrupt. The specific name is given in 
honor of Professor Winchell.

tively long, very oblique with the axis of the shell, i>roducing a somewhat 
prominent posterior alation which is not distinctly defined from the body 
of the shell ; cartilage-pits in tlie area of each valve six or seven, as 
indicated by undulations upon the cast ; beaks placed A'ery near the ante- 
rior end, beyond which there appears to have been no distinct anterior 
ear ; beak of the right valve more prominent than that of the other, 
although the right valve is less convex transv^ersely than the left ; right 
valve having a somewhat regular and strong longitudinal convexity ; 
but its transverse convexity is very little in the anterior half, while its 
posterior half is nearly flat ; left valve nearly straight, or even slightly 
concave longitudinally along the axis, but very strongly convex trans- 
versely in all i)arts of the shell, this convexity being more abruj)t along 
the axis than elsewhere ; and there is also between the axis and the 
hinge-margin a slightly raised, rounded fold which extends from behind 
the beak to the posterior margin; adductor muscular imj^ression large 
and distinct in each valve. A few fragments show the surface to have 
been marked by the ordinary concentric lines of growth, and also that 
the test although firm was not massive. 

The dimensions cannot be definitely given, but the largest example dis- 
covered indicates a length of at least 80 millimeters. 

This shell differs too much from any of the few known Cretaceous 
species of the genus to need detailed comparison, but it is related to G. 
subtortuosa Meek & Hay den, which it resembles in being tortuous. It 
differs, however, in being a proportionally^ much shorter shell, in the

shape and position of the adductor scars, and in the relative position 
and arrangement of the cartilage-pits. It is less tortuous than G. tor- 
tuosa Sowerby, and its proportions are different. The relation of this 
species with G. subtortuosa is doubtless genetic, and it present<s one more 
among other now known similar cases of e^ident genetic relationship 
between the molluscan fauna of the Dakota Group and that of the later 
Cretaceous groups of the West, which were formerly unknown, but which 
the discoveries of Professor Mudge have done more than those of all 
others to show. 

Position and locality. — Strata of the Dakota Group, Saline County, 
Kansas, where it was discovered by Prof. B. F. Mudge, in whose honor 
the sjiecific name is given. 

Genus PTBRIA Scopoli. 
Subgenus Oxytoma Meek. 

Pteria (Oxytoma) salinensis (sp. nov.). Plate 5, figs. 1 and 2. 

Shell rather large for a Cretaceous Pteria; the body, exclusive of the 
wings, obliquely subovate, broad at the base, moderately gibbous, dis- 
tinctly but not very greatly inequivalve ; the left valve, as usual, more 
convex than the right and its beak more prominent ; the convexity of 
the valves somewhat uniform but increasing toward the umbonal region 
in each, where it is greatest ; anterior wing moderately large, defined 
from the body of the shell by being laterally compressed, but not by 
any distinct auricular furrow; the byssal sinus under the anterior wing 
of the right valve having the usual size and shape common to Oxytoma; 
posterior wing not proportionally large, and not distinctly defined from 
the body of the shell except by a somewhat gradual lateral compression; 
its posterior angle not greatly ])roduced; hinge-line less than the axial 
length of the shell; posterior adductor scars not distinct; anterior ad- 
ductor scars distinct and deep for a shell of this genus, placed immedi- 
ately in front of the beaks, that of the left valve being more distinct than 
the other. 

This, like the last-described species, is known only by natural casts in 
brown hematite of the interior of the shell, the imperfection of which 
will not allow of an accurate measurement of all its proportions. It is, 
however, known to have reached an axial length of more than CO milli- 
meters, a transverse width near its base of at least 50 millimeters, and 
a thickness of about 25 millimeters when both valves were in natural 
position. 

The character of the surface is not known, but it was evidently nearly 
smooth, as is usual with Oxytoma. It is related probably genetically to 
P. {0.) nehrascana Evans & Shumard, but it is a larger and more robust 
shell, with a proportionally larger anterior wing, more prominent beaks, 
and broader base.

Genus PACHYMYA Sowerby. 
Pachymya ? compacta (sp. nov.). Plate 6, figs. 3 and 4. 

Shell small, narrower posteriorly than anteriorly, slightly gaping be- 
hind ; beaks depressed, approximate, incurved, directed forward, their 
position being very near the front ; basal margin broadly convex; pos- 
terior margin narrowly rounded; postero-dorsal margin forming an 
oblique downward and backward truncation of that part pf the shell ; 
cardinal margin nearly straight, subparallel with the basal margin, 
much shorter than the full length of the shell ; ligament short, its area 
depressed and sharply defined ; front very short, depressed beneath the 
beaks and narrowly rounded below ; umbonal ridges prominent and an- 
gular or subangular; the space above and behind them moderately 
broad and flattened ; the remainder of each valve somewhat regularly 
convex. Hinge and interior markings unknown. Surface marked by 
the ordinary concentric lines of growth. 

Length, 29 millimeters ; height, 18 milUmeters ; thickness, both valves 
together, 14 millimeters. 

This species is evidently congeneric with the shell which in the An. 
Eep. U. S. Geol. Sur. Terr, for 1877, p. 298, I described as Pachymya f 
Jierseiji, and also with the Cypricardia f texana of Eoemer, but knowing 
nothing of the hinge of either of these forms, I am not satisfied that 
they are properly referable to Pachymya; yet in all their external char- 
acters they seem to agree.

Genus THRACIA Leach. 

Thracia myaeformis (sp. uov.). Plate G, figs. 1 and 2. 

Shell transversely subov ate in marginal outline; valves nearly equal; 
anterior end regularly rounded; wider and thicker anteriorly than 
posteriorly ; posterior portion narrowed vertically and somewhat com- 
pressed but gaping at the extremity; basal border broadly convex; 
posterior border abruptly rounded; cardinal margin slightly convex, 
but the prominent umbones give the shell a concave appearance behind 
the beaks ; a distinct linear depression is seen in the natm^al cast upon 
each side of the ligament; beaks prominent, incurved and directed a 
little forward; muscular impressions not distinctly shown in our ex- 
amples, which are natural casts in chalky limestone, but the pallial 
sinus appears to have been large and subangular at its anterior end. 
Surface marked by the ordinary lines of growth, and also by more or 
less distinct irregular concentric wrinkles.

Length, 57 millimeters; height from base to umbo, 
thickness, both valves together, 24 millimeters. 

In general aspect this shell approaches T, prouti Meek & Hayden, 
from the Upper Fox Hills Group of the Upper Missouri Eiver region^ 
but it differs in being proportionally narrower and more produced be- 
hind the beaks, and in the greater prominence of the umbones.

NOTES ON ACOtiliECTIOlV OF FISHES OBTAIIVED I!V THE STREAinS 
OF GUAIVAJtATO AND IN CHAPAI.A I^AKE, 9IEXI€0, BY PROF. A 
DUOES. 

By DATID S. JORDAIV.^ 

The collection which forms the subject of this paper was obtained 
by Prof. A. Duges in the streams of the province of Guanajuato in 
Mexico, and by him forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution. Many 
of them are extremely interesting as rei)resenting the ordinary North 
American fish fauna at a point near its southern limit, before it gives 
place to the Central and South American forms. 

Chirostoma estor Jordan, sp. uov. 

Allied to Chirostoma humholdtianum (C. & Y.). 

Body elongate but rather robust for the genus, the depth about one- 
sixth the length to the base of the caudal. 

Head very large, pike-like, forming more than one-fourth (two- 
sevenths) the length to base of caudal. 

Mouth very large, the maxillary reaching to past the front of the eye. 
Intermaxillaries forming the edge of the jaw strongly curved, their pos- 
terior portions broadly dilated as in Chirostoma menidium. Teeth strong, 
in several series in each jaw. Two small fang-like teeth on the front of 
the vomer. Lower jaw considerably projecting beyond the upper. Eye 
large, anterior, 5 in length of head, shorter than snout, and a little nar- 
rower than the interorbital space, which is nearly flat. 

Head covered with scales, which are smallest bn the occipital region, 
and largest on the lower part of the cheeks. Smaller scales on the inter- 
opercle. 

Sides of head vertical, a conspicuous ridge along the edge of the top 
of the head above and behind the eye. 

Scales small, anteriorly crowded, about 72 in a longitudinal series, 
and 18 in a cross series. Posterior margin of scales strongly crenate, 
so that the fish feels rough to the touch. 

* As Professor Jordan is far distant while this paper is going through the press, the 
proof has been compared with his manuscript by the editor of these Proceedings. In 
the de8crij)tion of Zoj)hendum australe two verbal additions are indicated in pareu- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 299 

Pectorals moderate, nearly half as long as head, reaching slightly 
past the base of the ventrals. Yeutrals rather short, reaching nearly 
two-thirds the distance to the base of the anal. 

Anal moderate, beginning considerably in front of the dorsal and end- 
ing a little behind it. Anal rays I, 18. Dorsal rays Y-I, 12. 

Spinous dorsal beginning nearly midway between insertion of ventrals 
and anal, separated from the soft dorsal by a distance equal to about 
two-thirds the length of the base of that fin. 

Caudal somewhat forked. 

Coloration uniform in spirits, the silvery lateral band but faintly indi- 
cated. 

The type of this species, 10| inches long, was obtained by Professor 
Duges in Lake Chapal a, Mexico ; it is known as Pesce bianco di Cha- 
pala ("poisson blanc de Chapala") in Guanajuato, according to Profes- 
sor Duges. 

It is one of the very largest of the Atherinidce, resembling a pike in 
its form, and in the large head and mouth. Its nearest relative is ap- 
parently CMrostoma Jmmboldticmum, also from Mexico, from which it 
differs in the much smaller scales, as well as in other characters. In Dr, 
Girard's arrangement of the AtJiermidw, this species would be likewise 
a Hetcrognatlius. 

The type of CMrostoma estor is numbered 23124 in the register of the 
TJ. S. ISTatioual ]Museum. 

Chirostoma humboldtianum (C & V.) Jor. iAtherina vomerina C. & V.). 

With the i)receding is a single specimen of another Chirostoma^ which 
seems to be the kumholdtiana of Cuv. & Val., with which the vomerina 
is doubtless identical. This specimen (No. 2313G) has the usual silvery 
band, D. IV-I, 10 ; A. I, 15 or 16 ; lat. 1. 50, the scales with entire 
edges. The long head is 4^ in length to base of caudal, and the body 
is rather slender. This example is 3^- inches in length. 

? Chirostoma brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaiuitiid) Jor. 

Nuuierous specimens (catalogue number 23135) of a small Chirostoma 
allied to brasiliensis and honanensis are in the collection. The body 
is short and compressed, the mouth small and oblique. Lat. 1. 36; 
L. trans. 1). D. IV-I, 9 ; A. I, 17. Silvery lateral streak very narrow. 
It does not fully agree with descriptions of either of the above species, 
and its habitat is remote from both. I do not, however, think it advisable 
at present to give it a separate name. 

Goodea atripinnis Jordan, gen. <fc sp. iiov. 

Gbneiiic desceiption. — Form of Hydrargyra or Fundulus^ but with 
the intestinal tract elongate, the dentary bones movable, and the teeth 
slender, tricusirid, movable, attached in a single series on the outer edge 
of the jaws, not closely set. Fins small, the dorsal and anal similar, 



300 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATION AI. MUSEUM. 

the dorsal slightly in advance of the anal, without spines. Scales mod- 
erate. Limnophagous. Sexual changes, if any, unknown. 

This genus differs from the most of the other Cyprinodonfukv in its 
tricuspid teeth. From Cyprinodon, Jordanella, Fitzroyia, Characodon, 
and Jenymia, the genera thus far known with tricuspid incisors, it is 
distinguished by the elongate intestines, and by the freeness of the 
dentary bones. The aspect is wholly unlike Cyprinodon, resembling 
rather Fundulus. 

Specific description. — Body oblong, considerably compressed, 
formed much as in Hydrargyra, the back nearly straight, little elevated, 
caudal peduncle deep. Depth of body 4-4J in length. Head short, 
broad, depressed, triangular and rather pointed, when viewed from the 
side. 

Mouth quite small, anterior oblique, the lower jaw projecting. Both 
jaws with a series of rather slender tricuspid teeth, which are loosely 
inserted, and somewhat movable, not close enough set to form a con- 
tinuous cutting edge. Head 4 in length. Eye moderate, directed 
partly downwards, 3^ in head, rather longer than snout and little more 
than half the width of the very broad interorbital space. A slight ridge 
from the occipital region backward. 

Scales rather large, 37 to 40 in a longitudinal series, and 13 in a 
transverse series. Humeral scale somewhat enlarged. 

Fins small. Dorsal fin posterior, very slightly in advance of the 
anal, which is also short and low, the two fins about coterminous and 
falling far short of the caudal. Caudal short and small. Ventrals 
small. 

Pectorals small, not reaching ventrals. Dorsal rays 12, anal rays 13. 

Color bluish above in spirits, sides nearly plain, with a silvery streak 
along each series of scales. Vertical fins obscurely marked, each of 
them chiefly black, especially on the distal half. There is no evidence 
of any modification of the anal fin in any of the specimens, which are, 
however, apparently adult. One of the two larger ones is apparently a 
female, the other probably a male. 

The intestinal canal is considerably convoluted and filled with mud. 

The types of this si)ecies, Xo. 23137, are numerous specimens of vari- 
ous sizes ; the two largest nearly 4 inches in length, were obtained by 
Professor Duges at L6on in Guanajuato. 

Zophendum australe Jordan, sp. nov. 

Allied to Zophendum siderium (Cope), but with larger scales. 

Body rather elongate, formed much as in Gampostoma anomalum, 
somewhat compressed, the back somewhat elevated and rounded ante- 
riorly. Depth, 4^ in length to base of caudal. 

Head rather large, slightly depressed or flatfish above, its length 
about 4 times (in length) to base of caudal. Mouth moderate, low, the 
lower jaw shghtly included, the premaxillary below the level of the eye, 
the maxillary just reaching the front of the eye. Lower jaw thin-edged, 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 301 

and with a slight symphysial knob as in Hyhognathus. Eye small, 
nearly C in head. 

Scales rather small, 10-55-7 or 8, the lateral line complete, somewhat 
deciirved. 

Dorsal fin moderate, slightly behind ventrals, D. 8 ; A. 7. Anal rather 
high. 

Pectorals not reaching ventrals, the latter (not reaching) to vent. 

Teeth 4-4, not hooked, with broad grinding surface as in Hybognathiis. 

Color dark bluish above, scales everywhere with fine black punctula- 
tions. Sides without black spots. A black spot at base of caudal &n. 

Peritoneum black; intestinal canal considerably elongate. 

Types, numerous examples (23130-23131), 5 to 7 inches in length, 
taken by Professor Duges in Lake Tupataro in Guanajuato, Mexico. 
The less number of scales (55 instead of 88) well distinguishes this 
species from Z. siderium. 

Hudsonius altus Jordan, sp. nov. 

Allied to Hudsonius fluviatilis. 

Body moderately elongate, compressed, deep, the back somewhat ele- 
vated, the depth 3f in length to base of caudal. 

Head short, somewhat depressed above, moderately pointed, 4| in 
length to base of caudal. Eye moderate, shorter than snout, 5 to 6 in 
length of head. Mouth medium, quite oblique, terminal, the premax- 
illary on the level of the pupil, the maxillary not reaching the front of 
the pupil. Jaws equal in the closed mouth. Preorbital large. 

Scales rather large, not closely imbricated, 8-46-4. Lateral line 
strongly decurved, 19 scales in front of dorsal fin. 

Dorsal fin high, inserted over the base of the ventrals. Dorsal rays 
I, 8. Anal I, 8. Caudal fin rather broad, forked, its peduncle deep and 
compressed. 

Ventrals shortish, reaching vent. Pectorals falling just short of 
ventrals. 

Teeth 4-4, hooked, with narrow grinding surface. 

Color bluish above, sides silvery, fins plain. 

Types, several specimens, numbered 23129, the largest about 8 inches 
in length, obtained by Prof. A. Duges in Lake Tupataro in Guanajuato. 

This species differs from its northern relatives, fluviatilis^ storerianus, 
etc., in the larger head, the oblique mouth, and in the presence of but 
one row of teeth.

DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO SPECIES OF FISHKK COLLECTED BY PROF. 
A. DCOE!^ IIV CEIVTRAI, ITIEXICO. 

By TARLETO^ H. BEAN. 

The larger portion of the fishes presented to the United States National 
Mnseuin by Professor Duges in June, 1879, have been reported npon by 
Prof. D. S. Jordan in a previous paper of these Proceedings.* In all 8 
species were transmitted by Professor Duges, 4 of them being described 
in the article just mentioned and 2 in the present paper as new to science. 

The discovery of Myxostoma and Amiurus in streams which flow into 
the Pacific is singular and interesting, and, at the same time, the occur- 
rence of additional genera, Zophendum and Hudsonius, characteristic of 
the Eastern United States, makes it desirable to know more of the 
climatic and statigraphic conditions existing in Guanajuato and adjoin- 
ing provinces. Ooodea and two of the Chirostomas are from a salt lake 
in the middle of a little volcanic plain in Valle de Santiago, Guanajuato. 

Myxostoma austiiiia Beau, sp. nov. 

The type specimens were collected at Piedad, ni Morelia (Michoacan), 
Mexico. They are numbered 23120 and 23121 in the United States l!^a- 
tional Museum catalogue. The species may belong to Minytrema rather 
than Myxostoma ; but in the absence of all the abdominal \dscera this 
point cannot now be settled. It has a remarkably small fontanelle. 

Descriptjon. — Body not elongate, rather stout. Lips j^licate, trun- 
cate or slightly rounded behind. 

The greatest height of the body equals about ^, and the least height 
of the tad -^ of the length of body.t 

The length of the head (.23-.24) is contained 4^ times in length of 
body. Its width (.15) equals the length of the base of the dorsal. The 
interorbital distance (.095) equals the length of the snout. The length 
of the operculum (.07-.075) equals h the length of the ventral. The long 
diameter of the eye (.04) is contained 6 times in the length of the side 
of the head. 

The distance of the dorsal from the snout (.45) equals 3 times the 
length of its base; the beginning of the dorsal is equally distant from 
the tip of the snout and the end of the anal. The longest dorsal ray 
(.16) is twice as long as the last (.08), and its length is contained 5 times 
in the distance of the anal from the snout. 

The length of the base of the anal (.085-.09) is contained twice in the 
distance from the snout to the nape. The longest anal ray (.22) equals 
in length the external caudal rays, measuring these from the origin of 
the middle caudal rays. The last ray of the anal is as long as the snout. 

The length of the middle caudal rays (.13) equals about J the height 
of the body. 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.25) is contained 4 times 

*Proc. U. S. Nat. Miis., vol. ii, p. 298. 

t Length of body is to be understood as length without the caudal. 



PKOCEEDINGS OP UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 303 



in length of body, and the length of the pectoral, 5 times. When ex- 
tended, the pectoral reaches the 11th or 12th scale of the lateral hne. 

The distance of the ventral from the snout equals 3^ times the length 
of the v'entral. 

Badial formula: D. II, 11; A. II, 6; C. 18 (developed rays); P. I, 
16-17; V. I, 8. Scales 6A-44-6^. 

Colors : Upper portion light brown (in the alcoholic specimens), lower 
parts yellowish ; some scales on the sides of the body are light brown 
at the base, in which respect the species resembles one of the varieties 
of 3i. macrolepidota. The ventrals and the right pectoral of specimen 
23120 have dark blotches on their lower surfaces, the ventral of the 
right side being almost banded. The right pectoral and the left ventral 
of specimen 23121 bear fewer similar blotches. The bellies of both 
specimens have several markings of the same kind.

Amiuxus Dugesii Bean, sp. nov. 

This species is allied to A. albidus (Le Sneiir) Gill, but has a much 
narrower head as is shown in comparing- the width (greatest extent) of 
the intermaxillary band of teeth in the two species. The head of 
A. Dugesii is also longer in i)roportion to the length of the fish without 
caudal, and the humeral process is slightly furrowed, and not strongly 
rugose as in A. albidus. The pectoral spine is not serrate. Amiurus 
Dugesii has the supraoccipital well separated from the second inter- 
spinal buckler. 

The typical specimens are numbered 23122 and 23123 in the Fish 
Catalogue of the Museum. They were received from Prof. A. Duges in 
June, 1879, and were marked in his invoice as coming from the Eio 
Turbio in the province of Guanajuato, Mexico. 

Description. — The height of the body is contained 4J to 5 times in 
its length without caudal. The distance from the end of the anal to the 
origin of the middle caudal rays is a little more than half the length of 
the head. 

The length of the head (.29) exceeds its greatest width (.21-.23) by 
one-third. The maxillary barbel can be made to reach the pectoral 
spine, and is contained 5 times in the length of the body. The distance 
between the eyes (.125) equals 4 times their long diameter (.03). The 
length of the snout is about ^ of that of the head (in the smaller exami^le 
somewhat less). The width (greatest extent) of the intermaxillary band 
of teeth (.095) is less than ^- of the length of the head (nearly ^ in A. 
albidus). The length of the maxillary (.04:-.045) is about ^ of the inter- 
orbital distance. The posterior nasal barbel is a little less than ^ as 
long as the maxillary barbel. 

The first dorsal begins midway between the end of the snout and the 
beginning of the adipose dorsal. The length of its spine is about equal 
to the length of the base of the adipose dorsal. Its longest ray is con- 
tained to 7 times in the length of the body. 

The distance of the anal from the snout equals 3 times the length of 
its base. The longest anal ray is as long as the ventral. 

The middle caudal rays are one-half as long as the external, measur- 
ing from the origin of the former. 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout (.26-.27) equals one-half 
that of the ventral from the snout. The length of the pectoral spine

REPORT OF KXPERTMEIVTii* UPOIV THE AIVIITIAI. HEAT OF FISHES,

IIV COIV:VE«JTIOIV WITH OPERATIONS OF THE riVITED STATES 
FISH COlUiniSSIOiX. 

By J. H. KIDDER, Surg^eon, IT. S. IVAVY. 

Sir : The investigation of the manifestation of animal heat by fishes, 
with which you intrusted me last summer, having been brought to a 
pause for the time being by the close of the Fish Commission's summer 
work, I submit the following report of my experiments, so far as they 
have gone, with a description of the instruments used and the mode of 
observation. 

But little in the way of actual experiment relating to this interesting 
question seems to have been done by other observers than those con- 
nected with the Fish Commission, although numerous allusions to the 
remarkable adaptability of fishes to extremes of temperature, and occa- 
sional records of more or less incomplete experiments, are to be found 
scattered through scientific literature. A complete bibliography of these 
fragmentary notes would be voluminous and of questionable value, but 
a short account of such observations as I have been able to find a record 
of, either interesting in themselves or of incidental value as throwing 
light upon the investigation, is appended to this report. 

So far as I have been able to learn, all of the observations made 
hitherto upon the temperature of fishes have been confined to the intes- 
tinal canal, the thermometer being passed into the rectum or oesophagus, 
as is the usual practice in observations upon the body temperature of 
mammals. But the conditions are by no means the same. The intesti- 
nal canal of a fish is thin and scarcely muscular 5 the walls of the abdo- 
men are also thin, and so sparingly vascular that no blood flows when 
they are cut through; and consequently, always surrounded as they are 
by water, against the chilling effect of which there is no sufficient pro- 
tection, it is by no means in the rectum or stomach that we should 
reasonably look for the body temperature of a fish. In point of fact, 
the experiments to be hereinafter detailed show clearly enough that the 
rectum temperature of a freshly-taken fish rarely exceeds that of the 
water in which it swims by so much as a degree (Fahrenheit). So that 
it may be quite safely taken as an index to the latter temperature when 
there is no deep-sea thermometer at hand. 

Another point to be considered is the fact that the gills of most fishes 
float freely in the surrounding water, and that all of the blood in each 
individual nuist, in passing through these organs, be spread out so as to 
expose the greatest possible surface to the chilling effect of the water 
quite long enough to reduce it to the same temperature. 

From the low organization of fishes, and from the simplicity of their 
digestive and circidatory functions, considered together with the fact 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 307 

that their blood itself is chilled by close proximity with the surrounding 
water at least once in each circuit, and that thus the oxidation of the 
blood, so important a source of animal heat in mammals, is quite neu- 
tralized, we ought not to expect so great a difference in temperature 
between the blood of a fish and the water in which it swims as obtains 
between the blood of mammals and the surrounding medium, nor that 
the limits within which its normal temperature must be confined should 
be so narrow. 

And, while it is difficult to believe that the chemical changes neces- 
sary to the nutrition, waste, and repair of the body of a fish, taken 
together with its active muscular movements, can go on without the 
evolution of a large amount of animal heat ; it is also plain that we are 
not to expect to find the manifestation of this heat either in the intesti- 
nal canal, a mere osmotic tube for the passage and absorption of the 
food, scarcely vascular and barely separated from the surrounding water 
by the thin bloodless walls of the abdomen ; nor in the arterial blood re- 
turning from the gills, chilled down to the temperature of the water 
with which it has just been in intimate contact. 

We should expect to find the blood of a fish at its warmest after hav- 
ing been distributed to the substance of the body, having furnished the 
material for nutrition, taken up the results of waste, and received the 
heat developed by these processes and by the conversion of muscular 
motion ; that is to say, in the heart and branchial artery. 

The experiments to be described have been tentative for the most 
part, and accordingly temperatures have been taken in the rectum, the 
stomach, various parts of the muscular tissue, the large venous trunks, 
the cavity of the "thorax"* after opening the heart, the interior of the 
heart and branchial artery, and the young fish in the ovary (of a dog- 
fish). When the heart was large enough to admit the bulb of the ther- 
mometer, the greatest differences between the temperatures of the fish 
and of the surrounding water were found in that locality. 

INSTRUMENTS. 

The thermometers used in these experiments were made expressly for 
the purpose by Mr. John Tagliabue, of No. 66 Fulton street, New York j 
and have proved to be very satisfactory. They are fifteen in number, viz : 

1. Two long thermometers, graduated in fifths of a degree, and cover- 
ing the range from 32° to 100° F., for use as standards. 

2. A set of five short thermometers, graduated in fifths, marking 10° 
each, and covering all together the range from 40° to 90° F. 

3. A second set of six short thermometers, similar to those last named, 
marking from 7° to 15° each, and covering the range from 30° to lOO^F. 

4. A short thermometer with the end carrying the bulb curved upon 

*The term "thorax" is used for conTenience' sake, as indicating the anterior part 
of the body cavity, in the neighborhood of the heart.

itself like a crook, graduated in fifths and marking from 55° to 74P F. 
(self-registering). 

5. A Negretti-Zambra deep-sea thermometer, graduated in degrees 
only, and ranging from about 25° to 100° F. 

All of these excepting the Negretti-Zambra are graduated upon the 
stems. The three highest in range of lot 2, one of the long standards, 
and the crooked instrument were made at first self-registering, on the 
principle of clinical thermometers, by a break in the column of mer- 
cury. They were so ordered in the hope that it would be possible to 
make some of the experiments upon living fish in tanks where the water 
could be artificially warmed above the temperature of the air. Such 
experiments not being possible (for reasons known to you) the self- 
registration was destroyed by reuniting the broken mercury column, 
and the necessary small correction applied. The curved thermometer 
was intended for use in a living fish, the bulb to be inserted either into 
the rectum or into an incision in the muscular tissue, and the stem to be 
secured to the body of the fish, wbich was then to swim free in the water. 
The highest temperature reached would be registered by the thermom- 
eter. This instrument, hke the other self registering thermometers oper- 
ating on the same principle, can only be made available when the tem- 
perature of the water is above that of the air, aud there has, therefore, 
as yet been no opportunity to make use of it. 

Owing to the curious molecular change which occurs in the glass of 
which thermometers are made, whereby, after from six months to a year, 
the instruments show an error of excess of from half a degree to a degree, 
these thermometers, which were necessarily "pointed" as soon as made, 
are not strictly accurate. They should be returned to the maker and 
rated again before being used next summer, so that the necessary cor- 
rection may be applied. For the time beiug the error has been to some 
extent met by Mr. Tagliabue, who has " overpointed " the scale about 
half a degree. I would also suggest the propriety, in case you conclude 
to continue temi^erature-observations, of ordering in advance one or two 
long thermometers, marking from 30° to 100° F., to be " pointed" after 
six months and used as absolute standards. Since, however, in these 
observations, absolute temperature is less important than relative accu- 
racy, I have taken much pains to rate all the instruments together, 
comparing them with the standard, and applying such corrections as 
will reduce all the readings to its scale. The same error, if any, will 
then be present in all observations, and relative accuracy will be pre- 
served. In Table A, which contains the corrections deduced from more 
than three hundred separate comparisons taken at nearly every degree 
on the scale, the small thermometers in daily use are numbered from 1 
to 5 for the first set, and from G to 12 for the second set (which has not 
yet been used), No. 1 being the thermometer of lowest scale. The com- 
parisons were made by immersing the thermometers in water, artificially 
cooled or heated. Only the means of each 10° are given in the table.

There are some practical difficulties in the use of these delicate instru- 
ments, which it is well to mention. 

1. The bulbs are long and large compared to the diameter of the 
column of mercury. Hence the latter is Very sensitive and responds 
quickly to the heat of the hand, even throngh the walls of the heart, or, 
in small fishes, of the abdomen. Thus in a small living blue-fish {Ponia- 
tomus saltatriv (Linn,), trill), observed September 8, in an aquarium- 
tank, the water being at 07° F., a thermometer passed into the stomach 
by way of tbe gullet showed 68.8° ; but, holding the fish in my left 
hand, I observed that the mercury was slowly rising and had reached 
73° in two minutes. This accession of heat was communicated through 
the thin Avails of the abdomen from my hand. 

2. Owing to the extreme fineness of the mercurial column it is quite 
difficult to distinguish it at all from the empty part of the tube, unless 
the light falls upon it at exactly the proper angle. When taking the 
temperature of a struggling fish on the deck of a vessel, in the full 
glare of the sun, and with the thermometer perhaps smeared with blood, 
it is impossible to be too careful in guarding against errors of observa- 
tions. 

3. A difference of several tenths may be apparent in the reading- 
according to the position of the observer. Looking down upon the 
column he reads too low -, looking up, too high. His eye should be exactly 
opposite the top of the mercurial column. After use, the thermometer 
should be wiped perfectly clean and laid back in its proper bed in the 
case, lest in the hurry of the next observation the wrong oue be taken 
ui), and time lost. 



310 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

4. The Negretti-Zambra deep-sea tliermometers, which depend for 
their self-registration upon the breaking of the mercurial column at a 
certain place when the instrument is overset in pulling it up, have some- 
times a trick of breaking the column in the wrong place, and so giving 
a false indication. In one instance I noticed that the break was diago- 
nal, instead of being directly horizontal, as it should have been. Pro- 
fessor Hind, of Halifax, informs me that he has noticed the same defect 
and has brought it to the notice of the makers, who have assured him 
that it has been corrected in their more recent form of instrument. It 
should also be always remembered that the temperature recorded by 
these instruments is not that of the bottom, but of about a fathom 
above it, owing to the play of line required in attaching them to the 
sounding-line so that they may overset easily and not strike against 
the lead. 

MODE OF OBSERVATION. 

The circumstances of the summer's work are too well known to you 
to require repetition here. In explanation of the smaU number of 
observations (ninety-seven for the whole summer) it will be sufficient to 
refer to the unusual inclemency of the season, permitting not more than 
an average of two excursions a week ; and to the remarkable scarcity 
of fish, which made a large proportion of the excursions blank as to 
results. Many fishes were brouglit up in the trawl-net of the Speedwell 
(the naval steamer used by the Fish Commission), but had been so long 
in the net, pressed upon by each others' weight, as to come up for the most 
part dead; and always showing by their rectum temperature (which 
should be near that of the bottom) that they were not in their normal 
condition as to animal heat. Such observations as were taken from these 
specimens are entered in the table (B), but arc not trustworthy for the 
purposes of this investigation. On one occasion I set a trawl-line fur- 
nished with some four hundred hooks, and took it in as soon as set. 
Although not more than twenty minutes had elapsed between setting and 
hauling, however, most of the fishes taken were already drowned, and all 
had lost a large proportion of their animal heat. Since, therefore, no 
tanks of sufiicient size for keeping fishes alive under observation were 
available, there remained only line fishing, which was carried on during 
the latter part of the summer as actively as the weather would permit, 
from the yacht Phantom, belonging to the Engineer Corps of the United 
States Army, and lent to tlie Fish Comuiission for the suuimer. The fish 
were all taken in Cape Cod Bay, and witliin ten miles of Provincetown, 
the two favorite localities being the steep edge of a shoal known as 
"Shank-Painter Bar," between Wood End and Pace Point lights, and a 
ledge in 15 fathoms of water some seven miles southwest of Wood End 
light. 

The rectum temperatures indicate, and I have no reason to doubt, 
that a fish caugiit with a line and hauled rapidly from the bottom to the 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 311 

vessel's deck has not bad time to materially change its temperature. 
The rectum usually showed from half a degree to a degree above the 
temperature near the bottom as indicated by a deep-sea thermometer. 

Having arrived on the ground and anchored, the first proceeding was 
to sound and take the temperature of the water near the bottom by 
means of a Negretti-Zambra thermometer attached to the sounding-line, 
about half a fathom above the lead. The temperatures of the surface 
water and of the air were then taken with the same thermometer, and, 
where the depth exceeded 20 fathoms, another observation was made at 
15 fathoms for subsequent comparison. As soon as a fish had been taken 
it was seized and held firmly by an assistant, his right hand grasping 
the throat under the gill-covers and his left holdiug the narrowest part 
of the tail, while I passed a thermometer into the rectum and observed 
the temperature of that part. I then cut the fish open from the isthmus 
between the gills toward the belly, exposing the heart, through the 
walls of which the thermometer was passed into the branchial artery 
and the temperature taken agaiu. In this last manoeuvre the heart 
should not be field between the finger and thumb of the left hand any 
longer than necessary to pass the thermometer-bulb into the artery, lest 
heat be communicated from the hand through the walls of the heart and 
give too high a reading. Then followed observations upon the tempera- 
ture of the muscular tissue or other parts, when such were taken. 
When the fish was too small to admit the bulb of the instrument within 
the heart an effort was made to take the temperature of the blood as it 
flowed from it, or the temperature of the liver was taken, or, in very 
small fishes, the thermometer was passed into the stomach, through the 
oesophagus. 

The above procedure is that finally adopted, after refiection upon the 
unsatisfactory results following observations made in the ordinary way 
(in the rectum). As to the cruelty of the operation, I am inclined to 
believe that it is more apparent than real, the fish showing no conscious- 
ness of pain, by struggling, i&c, after the first incision. 

BESULTS. 

This summer's work must be considered to be, as I have said, only 
experimental. The subject had to be studied from the beginning, with no 
records of previous similar experiments to go by, and many observations 
were wasted in learning how to proceed. Enough has been ascertained, 
I think, to show that fishes do develop animal heat by their own vital 
processes in the same manner as, but to a less degree than, other verte- 
brate animals. In other words, it appears from these experiments that 
when proper precautions have been observed in making the experiments 
all living freshly-caught fishes will be found to manifest a body temper- 
ature differing considerably from that of the water in which they swim ; 
the degree of difference varying with the perfection of the organization 
of the fish (and hence the activity of its nutrition), and ^viththe temper- 



312 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

atnre of the water iu which it swims. Thus the dogfish {Squalus acan- 
thias, LinuiEus) possessing a far more perfect digestive and circuhitory 
system than the cod, shows a much greater excess of blood temperature 
above that of the surrounding water ; and cod taken at the depth of 15 
fathoms in water at 52° F., show a less excess than others taken in 25 
fathoms at 41°, but a greater excess than blue-fish {Pomatonms saltatrix 
(Linn.) Gill) taken at the surface, at 69° and 70°, which is presumably 
nearer the normal temi)erature of the last named fish. 

Upon this question of normal temperature, my observations have not 
thrown much light, oAving to the fact that nearly all the fishes observed 
have come from water at about the same temperature, and that blue- 
fish, from which the most valuable results were to be expected on 
account of their activity and the warmth of the water which they 
inhabit, could not be taken with a line after the two days of their first 
appearance. It is reasonable to suppose, from the fact that the cod, for 
instance, shows a less difference when taken from warmer than from^ 
cold water, that a point would soon be reached at which the tempera- 
ture of the blood of the fish would coincide with that of the surrounding 
water, and that this point would be near the "normal" for that family, 
or in other words the limit above which it could not live.* 

The experiments are set forth at length in Table B, but some of the 
conclusions for which they furnish a reasonable basis may be con- 
veniently stated here, considering each species separately. 

1. Cod {Gadits morrJma, Jjiiniiens). Twelve observations. The fishes 
were taken with a hand-line, either at the edge of " Shank-Painter 
Bar," a sand-bank about half a mile wide which makes out along the 
end of Cape Cod from Eace Point to Wood End light-house, in 22-25 
fathoms of water, or on the " Ledge," a small rocky shoal lying about 
seven miles WSW. from Wood End light, where there are from 13 to 
15 fathoms of water, according to the state of the tide. The rectum 
showed an average excess of 0.97° above the temperature of the water 
near the bottom. In the bloody fluid resulting from the mixture of 
water with the blood escaping from the heart into the "thorax," the 
average excess of temperature was 3°, and in the heart itself 4.63°. In 
one instance an incision was made into the side of a very large cod, 
from which arterial blood gushed forth. A thermometer i)lunged into 
this incision showed only 1.5° excess over the temperature of the water 
near the bottom. It was this observation which suggested the thought 
that the venous blood might be warmer than the arterial. 



* Prof. G. Bro-vvne Goode, wlio has been investigating the question of the tempera- 
tures prefenert by iliflerent fishes, conchides that the cod and its congeners seek water 
at 38° to 42° F. ; that the temperature range of menhaden lies between 50° and 75° ; 
that blue-fish are rarely to be found in Avater below 40°, or mackerel below 45° ; while 
black bass (Micropierus) thrive in the water of the northern lakes, frozen over for 
three months in the year and never rising above 65°. as well as in that of the Florida 
rivers, which becomes as warm as 90° in summer. Different families, as thus appears, 
show very different powers of adaptation to extremes of temperature.

2. Haddock {Melanogramrmis ceglefinis (Linn.), Gill). Eight observa- 
tions. The rectum showed an average excess of 1.3° over the temper- 
ature of the water near the bottom, and the circulation an average of 
5.3°. One fish, after ten minutes spent in a tub of water at 64.2°, 
showed an increase of temperature in the rectum of 7°. Another, which 
had been tied by the tail and allowed to swim 15 minutes at the surface 
(at 69.5°) showed an increase (in the rectum) of 1(5.8°; still 11.5° below 
the temi)erature of the water. On the 6th September, fishing on the 
"Ledge," the temperature of the water near the bottom at 15i ftithoms 
was 51.5°, while the recta of the first two or three fishes caught showed 
as low a temperature as 45°. Those caught later, after fishing in the 
8ame place for an hour or more, showed a rectum temperature of 51°. I 
suppose that the individuals first taken (the tide having just turned to 
flood) came up on the ledge from deeper water, the ledge being of small 
extent, and showed the low temperature of the water from which they 
had come, gradually approximating that of the shallower water as they 
remained longer in it. These first temperatures are left out of the account 
in determining the above averages, as untrustworthy, owing to the un- 
certainty of the temperature of the water by which they had been sur- 
rounded. Haddock were spawning as early as the first observations 
(July 30), which fact may account for their somewhat higher tempera- 
tures than those of cod taken at the same time. 

3. Pollack {Pollachius carbonarius (Lmw.), Bonaparte). Asingle full- 
grown specimen, weighing about 25 pouuds, was taken on the " Ledge" 
in 15 fathoms. The rectum temperature was 2.4° above that of the 
water near the bottom (42°), and that of the fluid in the thorax after 
opening the heart, 4.5°. Several of the youug of this species were taken 
from the wharves of Prcvincetown at different times and examined. 
Seven specimens taken from a depth of 8 feet (temperature of water 60°), 
and measuring about 8 inches in length, showed an excess of 0.5° in the 
rectum, 0.6° in the stomach (passing the thermometer through the gul- 
let), and 3.12° by the thermometer in the mass of intestines, &c., next 
the liver. They were in company with "tinker mackerel" {Scomber 
BeMyi, Storer), of a species not observed in this harbor for more than 
thirty years. 

4. Hake {Phycis chuss (Walb.), Gill). This fish was often taken at 
the same time with cod and haddock. Specimens were frequently 
brought up, dead, in the trawl-net. Those taken with a line were often 
too small for trustworthy experiment, but a very large individual, weigh- 
ing over 35 pounds, taken August 11, in 25 fathoms of water, at 42°, 
furnished the most satisfactory obser\ation of the season, owing to the 
large size of the heart and the sluggishness of the fish, which made it 
much easier than usual to be sure of the readings. In this instance the 
difference in temperature of the water near the bottom and that of the 
rectum was 2.4°, and between the bottom water and the heart, 9.8°. 
There was an ulcerated patch about 2 inches square on the side of the

head. Could this liave been the cause of the unusually high tempera- 
ture ? The presence of spawn in the abdomen protected the rectum to 
some extent, no doubt, from the chilling- effect of the water. Another 
specimen taken in 15 fathoms on the " Ledge" gave a difference of 3^* 
between the temperatures of the rectum and heart, the bottom tempera- 
ture being uncertain for reasons already stated. (See page 313.) 

5. Blue-fish {Pomatomus saltatrLv {Linn.), Gill). These were caught 
on only two occasions, although often fished for unsuccessfully. Four 
specimens on the first day and one on the second were taken by trolling, 
and brought in after \iolent resistance. The average rectum tempera- 
ture of the first four was 0.25o higher, and the temperature obtained 
by an incision into the muscles of the side 1.55° lotver than that of 
the surface water from which the fish came (73.2°). The surface water 
was unusually warm on this occasion, and the fishes may have come 
from a deeper and colder stratum. Otherwise the indication would ap- 
pear to be that they resisted in some way the higher temperature than 
that to which they were accustomed. They Avere taken from different 
schools and at different times. The single fish taken on the following 
day showed a rectum temperature of 0.5°, and in the muscles of the side 
1.7° above that of the surface water (70.5°). The muscles of the side of 
this last fish, however, were only 0.5° warmer than the average (71.5°) 
of the four taken the day before. At this time I had not yet begun to 
observe the temperature of the blood in the heart and branchial artery. 
Young blue-fish, 3 or 4 inches long, have been caught from the wharves 
at different times, but have been too small to afford trustworthy obser- 
vations. 

6. "Tinker mackerel" (young of iSeomher .scomber, Linnteus, and 
Scomber Dekayi, Storer). No fully-grown mackerel have been taken 
with the line in the neighborhood of Province town for several years. 
The "tinkers," however, from to 8 inches long, abounded toward the 
last of the season, and upon these several observations were made at 
different times, the temperature of the surrounding water being taken 
at 6 feet below the surface, the length of line required in fishing. The 
anus was too small to admit the bulb of my thermometers, and tempera- 
tures were therefore taken in the stomach through the gullet, and in the 
immediate neighborhood of the liver after dividing the larger blood- 
vessels. The average of twelve observations gives an excess of tem- 
perature over that of the surrounding water of 4.1° in the stomach, and 
5.25° in the neighborhood of the liver. The individual temperatures 
were surprisingly uniform. Three specimens of young Scomber DeJcayij 
taken from the wharf in 8 feet of water at (>0°, showed an average 
excess of 2,3° in the neighborhood of the liver. 

7. Chogset {Tautogalabrus adspersus (Walb.), Gill). Two observa- 
tions were made upon a single small specimen in an aquarium-tank, the 
water being at 65.9°, and the thermometer passed into the stomach 
through the gullet. The excess of temperature over that of the water 
was 1.2°. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 315 

8. ScuLPiN {CoUus octodecimspinosus, Mitchill). A single specimen 
showed an excess in the rectum of 0.8°, and in the neighborhood of the 
liver of 3.2° over the temi)erature of the surrounding water. 

9. Sea-raven {Hemitripterus americanus (Gmel.), Storer). A speci- 
men kept alive in a tub on board of the Speedwell for three-quarters of 
an hour (the water marking 70.Go) showed an excess in the temperature 
of its circulation over that of the water of 4.4°. Another specimen 
brought up in the beam-trawl-net showed an excess in the rectum of 
17.7° and in the heart of 18.9° over the temperature of the bottom water, 
but had been half an hour in the trawl, pressed closely on every side by 
a mass of fishes and sponges. So that the observation is valueless ex- 
cepting in that it shows that even under abnormal conditions, so long 
as the fish lives, there is a difference between the temperature of the 
rectum and of the venous blood. 

10. GoosEFiSH (LopMus piscatorius, Linnsens). This fish is admirably 
constructed for temperature experiments, being provided with a very 
large heart and branchial artery, and, moreover, with a highly organized 
digestive system. Unfortunately the only two specimens observed were 
brought up in the trawl-net with the above-named sea-raven, and had 
their body temperatures abnormally raised in the same manner. The dif- 
ference in temperature between the rectum and the cu"culation was 4.4°. , 

11. Eel-pout [Zoarces anguillaris (Peck), Storer). Two specimens 
taken in the trawl-net at the same time and under the same circum- 
stances as the preceding showed a difference between the temperatures 
of the rectam and the circulation of only 0.5°, the fishes being almost 
dead. A single specimen taken afterwards with the hand-line showed 
an excess in the rectum of 3°, and in the neighborhood of the liver of 
C°, over that of the surrounding water. 

12. Flounder {Hippoglossoides platessoides (Fabricius), GiU). In a sin- 
gle specimen taken on a trawl-line the temperature of the circulation was 
3° above that of the water near the bottom. 

13. DociPiSH [Squahis acantJiias, Linnaeus). This species was much 
the most abundant of any near Provincetown. Owing to the high or- 
ganization of the digestive system of the order to which this fish belongs, 
it was to be expected that the heat resulting from the processes of nu- 
trition would be found in it to be highest. Accordingly, as the table 
shows, the differences between the body temperatures and those of the 
surrounding water are here greater than tbose manifested by other fishes. 
In a series of five taken from cold water (40.4°) the average rectum tem- 
perature was 4.4° and that of the circidatiou 12° above that of the water 
near the bottom. The greatest difference occurred in a female, the ova- 
ries of which contained well-developed young, in which case the circu- 
lation was 10.0° warmer than the surrounding water. A young dogfish 
about 9 inches long, with umbilical vesicle still attached, taken from 
this specimen, gave an excess of 20.0° in the heart above the temperature 
of the water, the greatest difference observed during the summer. In 
this young fish there was of course no cooling of the blood during its

passage throiigli the gills (those organs not having yet come into use), 
nor otherwise than mediately through contact with the body of its 
mother. Another adult female with young in her ovisac showed an ex- 
cess of 9.4P in the rectum (oviduct!) and 15.6° in the heart over the tem- 
perature of the water. In another series of fourteen observations upon 
specimens taken with a trawl-line, and half drowned when drawn up, 
the body temperatures had approximated that of the surrounding water. 
In this observation, too, the Negretti-Zambra thermometer failed to act, 
the column breaking in the wrong j^lace, so that the temperature of the 
bottom water had to be guessed at from that of the recta of the fishes 
and from previous observations in the same neighborhood. It was prob- 
ably not higher than 4:2'^. Above this supposed bottom temperature 
the fourteen half-drowned dogfish gave an excess of 2.2° in the rectum 
and of 4.8° in the heart and "thorax." The greatest excess was 0.7°. 
Still another series of seven taken with a line on the "Ledge," when the 
indicated bottom temperature could not be relied on, for reasons already 
given (see p. 313), showed an average difference between the rectum and 
heart temperatures of 6.7°, while in another specimen the difference be- 
tween the rectum and muscles was only l.G°. 

14. Skate {Raia eriuacea and R. Iwvis, Mitchill). Three individuals 
of the former species, which had been half an hour with a number of 
other fish in the trawl-net, and were therefore useless for comparison 
with the bottom water, showed an excess in the temperature of the blood 
over that of the rectum of 3.1°. Four individuals of the latter species 
{R. Icevis) taken on the "Ledge," when the temperature of the water from 
which the fish came was unknown, gave a difference between rectum and 
circulation of 2.9°.

Mnety-seven fishes have been observed during the summer, but many 
of the observations are of doubtful value, as has been explained in the 
foregoing pages. Such as the experiments are they appear to me to 
point to the following conclusions: 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 317 

First. All fishes develope animal heat, its quantity varying according 
to the organization rather than the habits of the family. 

Second. This heat results from the processes of nutrition (chemical) 
and from the conversion of muscular motion (mechanical). That result- 
ing from the oxidation of the blood is lost in the gills ; hence the venous 
blood is decidedly warmer than the arterial. 

, Third. Spawning and breeding fishes develope more heat than those 
not carrying on these processes. 

Fourth. Elasmobranchs and, generally, fishes with a highly differen- 
tiated digestive apparatus develope more heat than those of simpler 
organization, and (probably) very active surface fishes more than slug- 
gish bottom fishes. 

Fifth. The intestinal canal and arterial blood do not correctly indicate 
the animal heat of fishes. 

Sixth. The question of "normal range of temperature" remains un- 
answered. 

SUGGESTIONS. 

Shoukl you think it desirable to continue this investigation I would 
suggest that the inquiry include the following details, indicated by last 
summer's experiments : 

First. The range of temperature through which living fishes may be 
carried. This might be observed by subjecting different species in 
tanks to varying temperatures produced by ice or steam introduced into 
the water, and noting the body temperature of the fish when it begins 
to show signs of distress. Each experiment would expend a fish, but 
the importance and practical bearing of this question of " normal range" 
of temperature might justify the expense. Much could be learned by 
observing the temperature of the water at which the fish begins to show 
signs of distress. In such a harbor as that of Proviucetowu a consider- 
able difference in the temperature of the water can be got by towing a 
wooden-latticed tank into shallow water at ebb-tide and into suitable 
positions at flood-tide. 

Second. Amount of oxygen required by different fishes. This may be 
approximated by keeping different species under observation in separate 
tanks without a fresh supply of water. 

Third. Length of life after being withdrawn from the water, and sub- 
sequent duration of muscular irritability. Also the number of respira- 
tions per minute in different species when at rest. 

Fourth. Influence of muscular movements on temperature. This may 
be observed by tying a fish by the tail, in the water, until it exhausts 
itself by struggling, and then taking the temperature, to be compared 
with an observation upon another individual of the same species under 
similar circumstances, but at rest. 

Fifth. Comparative activity of nutrition as indicated by the percent- 
age of nitrogenous matter in the excreta. 

Sixth. The repetition of similar observations on the plan of those 
made last summer.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS. 

Dr. John Davy, iii a paper read before tlie Royal Society, in 1885, on 
the tempeiatiu'e of some fishes allied to the mackerel, observed that the 
bonito had a temperature of 90° F. when the siUTounding medium was 
80.5°; and that it therefore constituted an exception to the generally- 
received rule that fishes are uuiversaUy cold-blooded. 

*Tarrell says: "The consumption of oxygen, however, is small; and 
the temperature of the body of fishes that swim near the bottom, and 
are known to possess but a low degree of respiration, is seldom more 
than two or three degrees higher than the temi)erature of the water at 
its surface." This statement does not appear to be founded upon actual 
observation, since the temperature of a bottom-feeding fish taken from 
water at any considerable depth might be, and usually is, much below 
that of the surface water, and still considerably above the temperature 
of the water inhabited by the fish. Thus, in the waters about Province- 
town, the difterenee between the bottom and surface water temi>eratures 
at 20 fathoms is frequently as great as 30^ F. At the time of Yarrell's 
writing but little was known of the temperature <»f the water at consid- 
erable depths, the deep-sea thermometer being an instrument of com- 
paratively recent use. The quotation illustrates sufficiently well the 
mistaken theory which underlies the universal belief in the cold-blood- 
edness of fishes, and which looks to the consumption of oxygen only 
for the source of animal heat. As has already been shown, whatever 
heat is developed by this process in fishes is quite lost to its body tem- 
perature by the contact of water with the aerated blood in the gills. 

The attention of this excellent observer ( Yarrell ) was strongly attracted 
to the question of the animal heat of fishes, and he has collected a large 
number of quotations bearing upon the adaptive power of fishes to ex- 
tremes of heat and cold, which will be referred to later on. He attached 
a great deal of importance to the correlation of muscular irritability and 
"quantity of respiration" in this connection, npon which subject he 
says : t " Physiologists have shown that the quantity of respiration is 
inversely as the degree of muscular irritability. It may be considered 
as a law that those fish which swim near the surface of the water have 
a higher standard of respiration, a low degree of muscular irritability, 
great necessity for oxygen, die soon, almost immediately when taken 
out of the water, and have liesh prone to rapid decomposition. Mackerel, 
salmon, trout, and berring are exaaiples. On the contrary those fish 
which live near the bottom of the water have a low stanihird of respira- 
tion, a high degree of muscular irritability and less necessity for oxy- 
gen 5 they sustain life long after they are taken out of the water, and 
then flesh remains good for several days. Oarp, (cod I), tench, eels, the 
diflerent sorts of skate, and all the flat fish may be quoted." As against

the above statemeut respectiug the speedy death of surface swimmers is 
the fact observed by myself, that a bhie-fish [Pomatomiis saltatrix (Linn.) 
Gill), taken August 5, showed distinct si<?ns of life after fifteen minutes 
spent upon the deck of the yacht, and that a fragment comprising- rather 
more than half the heart continued to pulsate for eight minutes after 
being separated from the body, and to respond to artificial stimulus for 
fifteen minutes longer. 

Prof. G. Brown Goode, of the Fish Commission, has been engaged for 
some years in the investigation of the relations of our Atlantic fishes 
to water temperatures. Last year (1878) he made several direct experi- 
ments upon body temperatures, testing the temperature of the rectum 
with a thermometer and comparing it with that of the water as indi- 
cated by a deep-sea (Miller-Casella) thermometer. The experiments 
were made upon cod and haddock for the most part, and the difterences 
between the rectum of the fish and the water from which it had been 
taken were found to be inconsiderable, rarely exceeding one degree 
Fahrenheit, as was the case in the similar experiments made by myself 
last summer. In the cursory examination which 1 have made of the 
literature of the subject I have found no other records of exact experi- 
ments upon the animal heat of fishes. 

There seems to be, however, no lack of authority for the general belief 
that these animals are cold-blooded, in the sense that they take on the tem- 
perature of the medium which surrounds them, and have not, like the 
higher vertebrates, a limited normal range of temperature, bejond which 
life cannot be long sustained. Professor Owen lends the weight of his 
great name to this opinion (in his general division of vertebrates into 
Saem(tfotherm(( and Haematocrya), and the instances which I now quote 
of the endurance by fishes of extremes of heat and cold without api)arent 
injury are sufiicient to establish incontestably the fact that they do possess 
such endurance to a remarkable degree. The earlier citations are taken 
at second-hand from Yarrell (Introduction to History of British Fishes). 

*Mr. Jesse {Gleaningti in N'afural Hisfori/^ 2d series, p. 277^ tells of a 
friend who saw a goldfish which had been frozen into a block of ice, 
and afterwards thawed into life. 

* Dr. Richardson relates that the gray sucking carp, common in the 
fur countries of .Vrctic America, may be frozen and thawed out again 
without injury. {Fauna Boreali Amencana, vol. 3.) 

♦Perch ha\-e been frozen and transported for miles, returning to life 
when thawed (T. S. Buchawan, Tntroduction to the Study of Nature)', 
and John Hunter says {Animal Economy) : " that these (fishes) after 
being frozen still i-etain so much of life as when thaw^ed to resume their 
vital actions, is a fact so well attested that we are bound to believe it." 

tMr. J. W. Milner (Assistant Fish Commissioner), had a mud minnow

( Umbra limi [Kirt.] Griiuther) wliicli was frozen within solid ice iu an 
aquarium-globe, three or four times, and each time regained its vitality 
upon being- thawed out. Instances similar to the foregoing can be ad- 
duced indefinitely. 

*The only hyherimUoit which is definitely know^u to occur among 
fishes, says Professor Goode, takes place iu the freshwater lakes and 
streams of cold regions. The fishes are driven by cold into the deeper 
waters, and there remain in a state of torpor, proportional iu degree to 
the amount of cold which they experience. Hybernation does not ap- 
pear to be in any case a voluntary act. The fishes do not become 
torpid of their own accord. They avoid it as long as they can, and 
only succumb when they are deprived of the means of escape. They 
never become torpid when there are greater depths to which they can 
retreat. 

tDr. C. C. Abbott reports of the fresh- water mullet {Myxostoma 
ohlongum): "ISTo degree of cold seems to affect the movements of this 
si)ecies, and hundreds can frequently be seen under the ice, moving 
slowly along the bed of the stream, feeding upon the wilted remnants 
of pond-lily and splatter-dock plants. * * * This applies also to 
our common roach {Stilbe americana), which, to a less extent, braves 
the chilling waters of our streams throughout the winter, and, in con- 
sequence, sutfers from the persecutions of the three species of pike 
{Esox reticidatus, fasciatus, jwrosus) inhabiting our streams." 

I See also IMr. Kudolph Hessel's observations upon the winter torpor 
of the carp. This appears to be a true hybernation, during which, al- 
though the fish takes no food in some climates from October until 
March, there is no diminution in weight. 

On the other hand, fishes have been reported as living and thriving 
in water at an exceedingly high temperature; high enough to produce 
death by coagulation of the albumen in their blood and tissues, unless 
there is some i^rovision by which their interior parts are maintained at 
a temperature lower than that of the surrounding water. As the exist- 
ence of any protection analogous to that afltbrded to mammals by the 
function of perspiration and evaporation seems obviously impossible to 
animals living in the water, it is difiQcult to understand in what way 
such a redu(ition in temj^erature can be i^roduced and kept up. 

§Thus, Humboldt and Bonpland observed living fishes in hot water 
thrown up from a volcano and showing a temperature of 210° F. 

§ Desfontaines found a Ghromis in the hot springs of Cafsa, in Bom- 
bay, the water in which showed 30° R. (97.5° F.), and Shaw afterwards 
saw small mullet and perch iu the same springs. {Travels in Bombay, 
folio, Oxon. 1738, p. 231.)

water without the town, where he saw small fishes, 4 inches long, not 
unlike gudgeons. The temperature is not noted, but he says: "Upon 
trying the heat by the thermometer I remember to have been much sur- 
prised that they could have existed, and even not been boiled, by con- 
tinuing so long in the heat of this medium." 

* Facts mentioned by Somerset induced Broussounet to make some 
experiments on the degree of heat which river fish are capable of endur 
ing. Details of the degrees of heat are not stated, but many species 
lived several days in water too hot for the hand. (This aud the preced 
ing citation from Dr. Hodgkin's additions to the translation of Dr. W 
F. Edwards' work "On the Influence of Physical Agents on Life.") 

t Professor Goode writes: "In warm countries an analogous phenom 
enon (to hybernation) takes place, which has been called cvstivation 
When the lakes and streams are dried up by the heat, the fish, seek 
refuge in the deepest pools, and when they too are dried, they bury 
themselves in the mud at the bottom and remain torpid until the rainy 
season refills the reservoirs and revives them." 

J Day reports that on January 18, 1869, he visited a large tank which 
was then almost dry, having only about four inches of water in the 
center, while the circumference was hard enough to walk on. The soil 
was a thick and tenacious bluish clay, from which, fully thirty paces 
from the water and two feet below the surface, were taken five living 
fishes. Two were Ophiocephahia punctatuH, and three were Rhincohdella 
aculcata. They were covered witli a thick adherent slime. "J.Z^ were 
lively and not in the least torpid.''^ Day also reports AmpJiipnous cuckia 
as having been dug up under similar circumstances. Mr. Whiting, 
chief officer of the western province of Ceylon, iuformed Sir Emerson 
Tennent that he had been twice present when the peasants had been 
digging up fish of nine to twelve inches long, full-grown and healthy, 
^\\\c\x jumped on the hanlc wlien exposed to the light. 

Batrachians, tortoises, and laud-snails are commonly found in a torpid 
state during the hot and dry months, a state which may truly be called 
cvstiration, but which differs decidedly from the condition of activity 
described above as observed in buried fishes, and fi)r which there is no 
very obvious explanation. 

The instances cited are sufficient to show that the popular belief that 
fishes possess no animal heat of their own rests upon well-attested 
observations. At first sight it is difficult to understand otherwise how 
these animals can undergo the extremes of heat and cold which they 
have been known to undergo and continue to live. Yet, when the 
adaptability of birds and mammals, whose normal range of body tem- 
perature is so extremely narrow compared with that of fishes, to extremes

PR0CEEl)I\G8 OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 325 

of heat and cold is fairly cousidered, the necessity for this inference 
seems to l>c not so very ol)vions. And no one appears to liave tried 
the experiment of subjecting- the same iiidivirluals to great differences of 
temperature, whereby tlie immense effect of inherited adaptation would 
Imve been thrown out of the account. 

With the exception of the often-quoted paragraph from Humboldt 
and Bonpland, none of the foregoing observations attest a higher tem- 
perature than 1130 F., noted by Saussure as endured by eels in the hot 
s])rings of Aise. This is but little above the temperature ol>served at 
r\)rt Yuma, in California, which is occupied as a military post. 

I have not yet found the original passage. from which the statement 
credited to Humboldt and Bonplaud, as to living fish in water at a tem- 
])erature of 210° Fahr., is quoted. Yarrell gives no indication of the 
pi-ecise ])lace from which he cites. In an essay* ^^ iSur toie nouvelle 
r.sjUTe (k pimelodm''^ {P. cijclopnm), however, Humboldt writes: "L'ha- 
sard a voulu que ces inondations voh;aniques n'eussent pas lieu l'ann6e 
(|ue j'ai passee dans les Andes de Quito; mats les poissons vomis par les 
volcans sont un phenoinene si comnmn et si generalement (*onnu de 
tons les habitans de ce pays, qu'il ne pent pas rester le moindre doute 
sur son authenticite." From which it appears that, on the occasion re- 
ferred to at least, he was obliged to rely uj)on second-hand testimony ; 
especially upon that of M. de Larrea, of Quito, who had collected a cab- 
inet of minerals, was instructed in chemistry, and had looked into the 
records of many villages around Cotopaxi. From this gentleman he 
learned that in 1(391 myriads of the fishes in question were vomited up 
from the volcano of Imbabarri, causing a fever among the neighboring 
people. Some Indians assured him ("quelques Indiens m'ont assure ") 
that the fishes were living as they came down the side of the mountain, 
" mais ce fait ne me paroit assez arcrc:'' Very few of the specimens 
that he saw were suflSciently disfigured, in his opinion, to indicate ex- 
posure to very great heat, and the specimens came out of the mountain 
mixed with an argillaceous mud. Humboldt conjectures the existence 
of subterranean lakes whence he supposes the fishes to have come. ]S"ot 
having found the original passage, I cannot, of course, say how lar its 
context might modify the inferences which have been drawn from it as 
(pioted, but it is evident that at the time here referred to, at least, he 
had no idea that the fishes were alive when thrown out from the moun- 
tain, nor did he make any record of the temperature (210° Fahr.) named 
in the citation. 

The instances of frozen fishes thawed into life again differ in kind 
rather than in degree from familiar experiences with frozen fingers, toes, 
and ears restored to their integrity by gradual thawing, irhoi they have 
not heen frozen too lomj. In no case, so fiir as I know, has any attempt 
been made to ascertain whether the frozen fish retains in its interior 
parts a temperature above the freezing-point ; nor is it stated that

fislies have been thawed iuto life after having been frozen for any great 
length of time. 

* Dr. Eichardson's remarks in a recent commnnication to Wature, upon 
'' Suspended Animation," are pertinent to this inquiry. " It is hard to 
say whether an animal, like a fish, frozen equally through all its structure, 
is actually deatl in the strict sense of the word, seeing that if it be 
equally and uniformly thawed it may recover from a perfect glacial 
state. In like manner it may be doubted whether a healthy, warm- 
blooded animal suddenly and equally frozen through all its • parts is 
dead, although it is not recoverable, because in the very act of trying 
to restore it some inequality in the direction is almost certain to de- 
termine a fatal issue, owing to the transition of some vital centre into 
the pectous state of colloidal matter. I do not, consequently, see that 
cold can be of itself and alone utilized for maintaining suspended ani- 
mation in the larger warm-blooded animals of full growth. * * * It 
is worthy of note that cold is antiseptic, as though whatever suspended 
living action, suspended also by some necessity or correlative influence 
the process of putrefactive decay."

DEStiRIPTlOIVS OF NEW GENERA AND MFEC'IE!!! OF FISHES FROIH 
THE COAST OF €AI>IFORNIA. 

By W. M. I.OCKI]\€iTO]>f. 

1. Leiirynuis paucidens, j;<'n. ft sp. uov. 

Generic characters. — Family Zoarcidw, allied to Lycodes. Ventral 
fins present, short ; no teeth on vomer and palatines ; dorsal and anal 
fins continued without interruption around the tail. Scales small, but evi- 
dent. The name is from Xeoiu,^ — smooth; N>vr? — vomer, in allusion to 
the character which chiefly distinguishes the genus from Lycodes. 

Specific characters. — Body elongate, eel-like ; extremity of snout 
subtruncate; profile of remainder of snout and head conic, slightly 
convex over the eyes ; highest part of the dorsal outline and deepest 
part of the fish perpendicular to a, j^oint about midway between the pos- 
terior end of the lower jaw and the base of the pectoral ; from this point 
to the slightly rounded end of the caudal the body tapers regularly both 
above and below. Head broad, the sides (viewed from above) almost 
straight from the opercula to about half-way between the eye and the tip 
of the snout, thence rapidly approaching and meeting in an obtuse point. 

Greatest depth of body from a little more than ten to a little less than 
eleven times ; length of head ^—^ times in the total length ; snout 2||

the second tifth of the total length. 

Nostrils mnch nearer to the extremity of the snout than to the eye 
and below the horizon of the lower margin of the orbit ; pro^ ided with 
a. short tube. 

Eyes elliptical, directed obliquely n^jwards and outwards; the inter- 
ocular [jpace only about ^ of the total width of the head, the sides of 
which continue to shelve outwards at the same angle with the eye-balls 
as far as the lower margin of the suborbital ring. Interorbital space 
concave to about the center of the orbit, at which point the two ridges 
bordering the eyes unite with the central ridge, separating again pos- 
teriorly. 

Mouth large, slightly oblique, the cleft straight, its angle reaching 
about to a vertical from the center of the pupil ; internuixillaries and 
maxillaries very slender; lower Jaw received within the upper; lower 
margin of mandible straight, with a small sym]>hysial knob, and a 
prominent articulation. In the females the mouth is smaller; maxillary 
with its i)OSterior extremity enveloped in the skin of the ongle of the 
mouth. Tongue large and thick. 

Teeth small, slender, bluntly pointed, those of the maiulible in about 
four irregular rows in front, those of the inner row largest and farthest 
apart. The outer row disappears at about } of the length of the cleft of 
the mouth from the tip of the mandible, but the inner row continues to 
about h the length of the cleft of the mouth. The outer row slopes out- 
ward, but the inner is much recurved, and the three or four posterior 
teeth of the inner row on each side are the largest and strongest in the 
jaws. Teeth of the intermaxillary in a single row, extending about 
half-way along the sides of the mouth, the largest in front, gradually 
diminishing posteriorly. oSTo vomerine or palatine teeth. 

Gill-openings narrow, inclined forwards, and broadly attached to the 
isthmus; branchiostegals six, sometimes only live. Pseudobranchiae. 
Operculum very small, with radiating ridges; cheeks fleshy, very long, 
so that the eye is nearly midway between front of oi)ercle and tip of snout. 
Upper and lower pharyngeal bones covered with villiform teeth; the 
posterior upper pharyngeal smallest ; the lower pharyngeals sei>arate, 
subtri angular. Gill-rakers quite short, pointed, flexible. 

Vertical flns continuous, long and low, and formed of soft rays 
throughout, dorsal connnencing at a vertical from a little before the 
center of the length of the pectoral, caudal somewhat rounded, anal 
commencing very near to the anus. Dorsal with aV)Out 90 rays ; anal 
with about 70.

their base vertical, aud extending' to tbe abdominal ontline ; the fin con- 
si8tin<>- of 18 rays, the fifth or sixth lonj>est, the lowest about f as long 
as the fifth; first three or four rays simple, the others bifurcate. 

ISTo lateral line. Scales roundish, smooth, separate, embedded in the 
skin, uniform over the whole of the body, except upon an area on the 
upper surface in front of the dorsal, \\iiere they are smaller, and region 
near base of pectorals scaleless. Head sealeless, the ridges somewliat 
prominent. 

Color olivaceous, the scales lighter than the skin ; tlie color formed 
by numerous dark points, Avliich are continued also upon the head. 
TJl^per surfsxce of liead darker, abdominal surface lighter than other 
portions. Vertical fins margined with black. 

This species is not uncommon in the markets at San Francisco. Two 
specimens, 10 to 12 inches in length, have been forwarded to the United 
States National Museum, where they are numbered 23502. They may 
be considered as the types of tlie species. 

2. Odontopyxis trispinosus, ,u,eii. utkI s]i. nov. 

Generic characters. — Family Agoinda', allied to AyonuH {cata- 
phractiis), from which it differs chiefly in the presence of teeth on the 
vomer and palatines. It is distinguislie<l from A(jonopsis, Gill, by its 
smaller fins and slenderer form. 

Specific characters. — Body (jctahedral, the lower flat side termi- 
nating behind the anal fin, the upper side a little behind the second 
dorsal. Posterior portion of body hexagonal. Bod}' anteriorly very 
much broader than deep, the ujjper side, from the head to its termination, 
concave; lower side slightly concave; the other surfaces flat. Lateral 
surfaces (traversed by the lateral line) wider anteriorly than those sepa- 
rating them from the u]>per and lower surfaces; posterior to the second 
dorsal the lateral surfaces are narrowest. 

Greatest depth, above ])ectoraI, 10-12 times in length; greatest width, 
at gill-covers, 7f-8; length of head, 5|-5i times in the total length ; eye, 
3^-3|; sn<mt, 3^-3| ; interorbital width, ^>f^-7 times in length of head. 

Head triangular, depressed. A sharp, rather long, movable spine 
upon the tip of the snout, its trianguhir base projecting beyond the Jaws; 
behind this central spine, on the highest point of the snout, is a pair of 
similar, but recurved, fixed spines. Snout posterior to these spines 
nearly level to orbital region. A prominent supra-orbital ri<lge ending 
posteriorly in a backward-directed spine. Forehead strongly convex 
longitudinally, and strongly concave transv^ersely. Occiput slightly 
depressed betwe<ni the i)ar-occipital ridges, its posterior border <leeply 
emarginated. Supra-occipital ridge but slightly marked above, but very 
conspicuous on the hinder margin of the head, where there is a deep 
cavity iii front of the first series of body-plates, this cavity longitudi- 
nally divided by the supra-o(;cipital ridge. A sligiitly-marked ridge 
from the center of the hinder margin of the eye to the lateral keel of

the ni)per surface. A backward-directed spine on each preorbital. 
Nostrils in a depression on each side of the snout. Lower Jaw received 
within the upper both on front and sides. Jaws, vomer, and pahitines 
armed with iriiiuite, sharp, closely set teeth. 

JNIaxillary almost entirely concealed by the free edge of the pre-orbital 
when the mouth is closed. Two minute barbels at each angle of mouth. 
Orbit large, almost (Mrcular, occupying far the larger portion (►f the 
height of the liead, the upper margin of the pupil touching a line drawn 
from tlic upper part of the snout to the occiput. 

Gill-membranes attached to a broad isthmus; branchiostegals seven. 

Pectoral shorter than head, broadly rounded on lower margin, and 
composed of fourteen simple rays. 

Ventrals inserted posterior to the insertion of the pectorals, close to- 
gether, consisting of a spine and two unbranched rays. 

Vent a conspicuous elliptical opening, situated at about the middle 
of the length of the ventrals. 

First dorsal of four spines, the second longest, the fourth shortest, the 
third slightly longer than the first; its base occupying the posterior 
portion of the seventh, and the whole of the eighth and ninth series of 
plates. 

Second dorsal of six unbranched rays, the second slightly longer than 
the first; its base occupying the fifteenth to the nineteenth series of 
plates, inclusive. 

Anal of six rays, opposite and similar to the soft dorsal. 

Caudal elongate, rounded on posterior margin, and consisting of 
eleven unbranched rays. Fin-membranes delicate. 

Thirty-five to thirty-seven series of plates from occiput to base of 
caudal, each series strongly keeled, each keel ending in a spine ; a circlet 
of horizontal spines around the base of the caudal. The two elongate, 
subrectangular shields at the base of the ventrals are in the line of the 
second series of dorsal plates, the first series terminating above the 
pectorals. Twenty-seven irregular ]ilates on the imder surface of the 
body in front of the ventral ]dates, Lat(n'al line simple, along the cen- 
ter of the lateral surfaces. 

Color olivaceous or yellowish, with six or seven darker bands of brown 
on the dorsal surfaces. Under side uniform whitish. Fins blotched with 
blackish. 

Three specimens of this si)ecies are known to me ; two of them Avere 
obtained in the markets of San Francisco. One of tln^se, which may be 
considered as the type of the species, has been forwarded to the United 
States National Museum, and is numbered 23504 on the Museum llegis- 
ter. The third specimen was procured on the coast of Alaska by the 
United States Coast Survey. The aspect of this fish is that of Acjonus, 
but the presence of teeth on the vomer and palatines excludes it from 
that genus.

jaws, the largest teeth in the front of the jaws, where there are more 
rows than at the sides. Similar teeth on vomer and palatines. Cush- 
ions of \illiform teeth on pharyngeals. 

Gill -rakers tubercular ; branchiostegals live, gill-membranes broadly 
connected below the throat ; no isthmus. Pseudobranchi?e present. 

Preoperculum with a large process which has four curved spines above 
and ends in a spine directed backwards. Sometimes there is a fifth 
spine on the upper margin, or the tip is bifid. Three other preopercular 
spines, the uppermost a little below the spine-bearing process, and

minute, smooth, imbedded scales. Opercle sniall, ending posteriorly in 
a flat, bluntish spine, behind which is a large membranous flap. 

First five spines of first dorsal sub -equal, the others diminishing 
rapidly, last very short. Two dorsals entirely separate, interval short. 

Second dorsal increasing in height to fourth or fifth ray, first ray 
about !^ as long as second. From the longest ray the upper margin in- 
clines regularly to the last (14th), which is about i the length of the 
longest. 

Anal similar to soft dorsal, but the rays shorter, fourth ray longest 
Origin of 1st dorsal opposite the center of the supra- scapular ridge, that 
of 2d opposite the 11th scale of the lateral line, anal arising opposite

the lower bearing the lateraUine, composed of 35 to 37 scales, beginning 
at the upper angle of the gill-openings, thence strongly decurved over 
the pectorals, thence running straight to the base of the caudal. Many 
of the scales on the posterior part of this band are provided with slender 
cirri. The upper band of scales begins further back, in front of the 
middle of the dorsal, and runs along the base of the dorsal fins, stopping 
before reaching the caudal. This band is composed of two series of 
alternating scales, closely wedged in together. Between and above 
these bands are a few small scattered imbedded scales. Like the scales 
on the head these small scales can only be seen with the aid of a magni- 
fying- glass. 

Color olivaceous, with darker spots formed of black punctulations ;

As the specimens obtained vary less than is the case with many species, 
and are of very u early the same dimensions, I subjoin measurements of 
two only. 

The principal variations are in the height of the dorsals and in the 
color of the paired fins and of the anal, which are much darker in some 
than in others. The dimensions are all axial, unless otherwise stated.

6. Batrachus tau, IJiuuimis. suhsp. beta, (iiinthcr. 

A specimen (]S'o. 23541), 22 centimeters hmg. was collected by Dr. 
Velie at Punta Russa, the most southern locality on record for this spe- 
cies.* 

This fish, like all other (iulf of Mexico specimens inspected by us, 
agrees closely with var. fj, as defined by Giinther,t in the tendency 
to expansion of the dark areas; the presence of small whitish spol« 
upon the body; the greater average number of bands on the anal, 
approximating in number those of the dorsal, and the marking of the 
pectorals and caudal in white spots upon dark ground, lather than in 
brown upon whit(\ The coloration of the southern specimens api)ears 
to be due to a tendency toward melanism, the dark arCJs being intensi- 
fied as well as exi)anded. In the Punta Russa specimen (No. 23511) the 
main color is nearly black, the lines and marblings being of light shades 
of brown and brownish white, sharply and beautifully defined against 
the dark body-color. In the Pensacola specmien, No. 21477, he me- 
lanistic tendency is l^ss evident. We consider the Gulf specimens as, 
for the present, constituting a distinct subspecies, founded entirely upon 
color. 

Radial formula of No. 23541, D. Ill, 24. A. II, 10. The first and 
second dorsal fins are continuous in 23541, but this is evidently' acci- 
dental. 

That the number of bands on the finsandtheir tendency to confluence 
is a character of little importance is shown in the following color notes:

* The National Museum has a specimen from Pensacola, Fla., collected by Silas 
Steams in 1878 (No. 21477) ; another from West Florida, collected by Kaiser and Martin 
(No. 5149), and two collected at Indiauola, Tex., by J. H. Clark (No. 746), No species of 
Bati-achus is now recognized from the eastern coast of South America, though it seems 
certain that some species, closely allied to B. tau, or perhajts even this very species, oc- 
curs in Brazil. Compare Batrachus Gronovii, Cuv. & Val., Hist. Nat. Poiss., xii, 1837,

7. Batrachus tau, snlKsp. pardus Goode & Bean. 

Two jspecimeiis of a very remarkable form of Batrachus were collected 
in l*ensacola in 1878 by Mr. Silas Stearns. They are mentioned on p. 
127, m our pai)er on the flshes of Pensacola, September 19, 1879. Our 
suspicions as to their specilic individuality then expressed have not 
been confii-med by more careful study. The characters by which they 
are so]t;ii;it('d from typical ^«trac7i**,s tow are extremely difficult to define. 
Yet, unless other specimens are obtained which shall bridge the chasm 
between the two Pensacola specimens and all others of B. tau from 
Pensacola and elsewhere in the Museum, we cannot but consider them 
as representing two distinct subspecies. The melanistic tendency of 
the typical B. tau in the South, as observed by Giinther and illustrated 
by all our Gulf specimens, shouhl be taken into consideration, for the 
types of B. pardus are lighter in cohn- than any specimens of B. tau in the 
Museum. 

The vertebrfe number 12-22 (the modified vertebra at the base of the 
caudal fin not being included). These fish were called in Pensacola by 
the names "Sea Eobin" and "Sarpo"; the latter being doubtless a cor- 
ruption of the Spanish "Sapo", meaning "toad". 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 337 

Color. — Body very light yellowish browu, gray beneath, thickly spot- 
ted with dark brown. Tlie spots on the head are smaller than those on 
the body. Those on the under side of the body are numerous, circular, 
the largest equalling the eye in size. On the upper part of the back 
are many large oblong blotches of brown, interspersed with numerous 
smaller circular spots. The markings of the dorsal and anal fins remotely 
resemble those in Batrachus tau, subsp. a and /?. In Ko. 22337a there 
are nine interrupted bands on the dorsal and six on the anal., two dis- 
tinct bands on the anterior half of the caudal, and on its posterior half 
numerous blotches of the body color or dark brown grayish. Pectorals 
grayish at the base, yellowish brown elsewhere, and thickly blotched 
with dark brown. 

In No. 223376 the oblique bands on the dorsal fin are obsolete, replaced 
by irregular blotches and an irregular marginal band of black. The 
anal exhibits obsolescent bands, perhaps eight in number. Caudal 
dark brown with a few light blotches. Pectoral as in 22337a, but with, 
a wide brownish black margin.

A small si)ecimen in bad condition (No. 23556), 45 millimeters loug^ 
from Clear Water Harbor, Fla. It agrees in most particulars with 
Scorpcvna jdidnieri, Sehn., but appears to have much larger scales. The 
scales Am rubbed oft' from the posterior part of the body, but the indi- 
cations are that they did not exceed 30 or 35 in number, while S. plu- 
mieri has 45. The count is not sufticiently (pertain to be of value, but 
the occurrence of the genus at this locality should be noted.

Clear Water Harbor, Fla. It agrees with Poey's type of JuMs humer- 
alis except in the absence of the nuchal band, the band upon the dorsal 
fin, and the dark corners of the caudal fin. These may possibly be 
acquired with age. The three Cuban specimens examined all exceeded 
120 millimeters in length.

Three specimens (No. 23027), 40 nullimeters to 55 millimeters long, 
were collected by Dr. J. W. Vt'lie, at Clear Water Harbor, Fla. The 
species is a strongly-marked one, and the specimens before us agree in 
every particular with Dr. Glinther's excellent description. They are of 
the brown type of coloration, and aie sufficiently young to show traces 
of the black ocella on the tail, though the blue ring is not very distinct, 
and of the convergent blue lines on the snout. Specimens of the same 
size from the Bermudas show them nuich more clearly.

A large specimen (No. 23647), in salt, about 20 inches long, was sent 
from West Florida by Dr. Velie. It agrees with the form which we at 
present call Trachynotnti goreensis. 

Several small specimens (No. 23637), 27 millimeters to 50 millimeters 
long, apparently of the same species, were obtained at Marquesas Keys.

The figure given by Girard in the Ichthyology of the Mexican Bound- 
ary, plate xi, fig. 4, under the name DoUodoncarolinus, is pretty certainly 
taken from a young specimen of this species, though the number of rays 
in the dorsal has perhaps been changed to make the figure correspond 
with the description on page 22. 

The young T. f/oreensis is distinguished from T. carolmus of the same 
size by the greater height of the spinous dorsal, the smaller number of 
dorsal and anal rays, and the stronger black blotch upon the lobe of the 
dorsal.

21. Haemulon fremebundum, ii. sp. Goode & Bean. 

Two specimens (No. 23G28), GO millimeters and G2 millimeters long, 
were collected by Dr. J. W. Velie, at Clear Water Harbor, Fla. Their 
general appearance is similar to that of Hccmulon trivittatum (Schu.) 
Goode {H. capeuna of the Bermuda catalogue), but the body is higher, 
the number of spines and rays in the dorsal fin is different, and the 
scales are much larger, particularly upon the sides, and the second 
anal spine much stronger. The form may possibly correspond to that 
called by Cuvier, H. caudimacula, but the description of this species is 
so vague that it does not seem justifiable to thus sanction the use of the 
name ; particularly since Cuvier's species came from Brazil. The diag- 
nosis here presented is uot a complete one, but none better could be pre- 
pared from our specimens. 

Diagnosis. — Height of body contained 3 times in total length without 
caudal, 3J in length of fish, caudal included. Length of head equals 
height of body. Length of snout less than diameter of eye (the speci- 
mens being young), and contained about four times in the length of the 
head, and equalling length of operculum. Eye contained in length of 
head less than three times. Posterior extremity of maxillary extends 
beyond the vertical through the anterior margin of the orbit, but uot

to that tliioiigli the luiddle. Preoperciihim with iiunierous shaip denti- 
cuhitions upon its posterior margiu and around the angle, the latter 
the largest. Dorsal fin moderately notched, the fourth spines the 
longest, contained twice in the length of the head. Second anal spine 
very strong, and longer than the fourth dorsal spine ; longer also than 
third anal spine. Pectoral flu reaches to vertical from lltli spine of 
dorsal, its length contained 4^ in length of body without caudal, 5^- in 
total length. Length of ventral equal to that of caudal peduncle, and 
extending as fiir back as does the pectoral. 

Scales very large, and so irregularly arranged that it is impossible 
to make a close enumeration of them ; there are about forty-eight to 
fifty-two rows. 

Color. — Pale, with a pair of bands as broad as the pupil extending 
from the snout, where they unite, following the dorsal line at a distance 
about equal to their own width and connecting with the same at the 
end of the base of the second dorsal where they reunite ; a second broad 
pair of bands, extending from the snout through the middle of the eye, 
in a stiaight line below the lateral line to the base of the caudal ; traces, 
on the head, of a pair of narrower bands between the two pairs already 
mentione<l; also a single stripe, on the mesial line of the body, from 
a point in advance of the eyes to the region of the dorsal. A very 
prominent blotch at the base of the caudal fin.

22. Rhypticus pituitosus, ii. sp. Uoodc & Be;iii. 

A single young specimen (No. 23555), 47 millimeters long, collected at 
Key West, Fla. Although immature, its characters seem to distinguish 
it from all described species. Its nearest ally is the RItypticus nigripin- 
nis of Gill, from Paimnia,* but we do not feel justified in referring ihe 
Key West specimen to this species, in view of the differences in color 
and the remoteness of the two localities. In radial formula? and pro- 
portions it agrees sufficiently well with Clill's diagnosis. 

Blaf/nosis. — One continuous dorsal. The height ot the body is less 
than the length of the head, being contained 3^ times in length of body 
without caudal, 4§ times in total length. Length of head, exceeding ^ 
of length of body without caudal, contained 3^ times in total length. 
Diameter of eye double the length of the snout and half as long as the 
lower jaw. Upper jaw reaches nearly to vertical from postericn- margin 
of orbit. Width of posterior expansion of maxilla equals one-third 
length of lower jaw. Length of upper jaw contained 2^ times in length 
of head. Length ol pectoral equals that of postorbital portion of head. 
Pectorals extend beyond the tips of the ventrals a distance equal to 
length of ventrals. Dorsal and anal fins higher posteriorly, the longest

Diagnosis. — Height of body contained 4f times in total length of body, 
without caudal, the length of the head 3-^- times. The spinous dorsal 
begins behind the vertical from the tip of the pectoral tin, and its origin 
is in the vertical from the tips of the rather long ventrals. The diame- 
ter of the orbit is contained twice iu the length of the head, being greater 
than the width of the iuterorbital area and more than twice the length 
of the snout. Snout obtuse, the top of tlie head being broad and very 
flat. The cleft of the mouth somewhat obliipie, the Jaws equal anteri- 
orly. The maxilla extends beyond the vertical from the anterior margin 
of the orbit, the mandible reaching nearly to that from its middle. Teeth 
very small in the jaws and on the Nomer. The silvery band occupies the 
third row of scales (the dorsal mesial row not being included in the 
count) ; its width is less than half that of the eye.

(13th or 13th ray,. Pectorals a little longer than ventrals (half as long 
as head); their tips falling short of reaching the origin of ventrals by 
a distance equal to half the diameter of the orbit. The ventrals are

notice: of a new species of the 'wiei^emoesia croup of 
crustacea' (recent eryontid.e). 

By SIOI^EY I. SrrilTH. 

Among the very interesting collections of marine invertebrate ani- 
mals made during tlie past two years by the fishermen of Gloucester, 
Mass., and presented to the United States Fish Commission, for the 
National Museum, there are two species of podophthalmous Crustacea 
of peculiar interest. One of these is a remarkable Paguroid which I 
have already described (Trans. Connecticut Acad., v, p. 50, 1S79), but 
of which several additional specnnens have been received since the de- 
scription was published ; the other, which is the subject of this notice, 
belongs to the "Willemoesia group of Crustacea," first brought into 
prominent notice by the researches in connection with the Challenger 
Expedition. Of the latter species 1 have seen only a single specimen, 
which was taken at a depth of 250 fathoms, oft" the coast of Nova Scotia, 
southeast of Sable Island, latitude 43° 10' north, longitude 61° 20' west, 
by Captain Thomas Olsen, of the schooner Epes Tarr. This specimen 
is not in very good condition, having been dried (probably after being 
taken from the stomach of some fish, tliough there is very little evidence 
of digestion having begun), and the internal organs consequently de- 
stroyed, but it is still suflflcient to throw considerable light upon the 
structural peculiarities of the group to which it belongs, and on this ac- 
count particularly I am induced to publish a special notice of it. 

Of the three genera into which Bate* has recently separated the 
forms of the "Willemoesia group," our species should unquestionably 
be referred to Pentacheles, but, on account of the at present uucertain

tenure of these genera,* I prefer to refer it pro^^sionally to Heller's 
genus PolychelesA It is apparently very distinct from any of the At- 
lantic species described by Heller, Willemoes-Suhm, | or Bate, but, 
judging from the very short descriptions given by the last author, it 
appears to be very closely allied to his Pcntacheles anricnlatvn obtained 
by the Challenger Expedition off the Fiji Islands. In fact I am not 
able to point out ajiy characters by which the two forms could be dis- 
tinguished, but, in view of their wide geographical separation, I take it 
for granted that they are distinct species, and that it would be easy to 
point out specific characters were Bate's species fully characterized.

2Iale. — The sides of the carapax are nearly parallel posteriorly, but 
arcuately convergent anteriorly, and the greatest breadth is just in 
front of the (cervical suture, and is about three-fourths of the length 
along the median line. As seen from above, the anterior margin is con- 
cave in outline, so that the lateral angles, which are acute and spiniform, 
are much in advance of the rostrum, which is armed with two spines 
close together and projecting obliquely u])ward and forward. About a 
third of the space between the median line and the lateral angle each 
side is occupied by a very deep orbital sinus nearly i)arallel with the 
lateral margin, considerably deeper than broad, somewhat narrowed and 
evenly rounded jiosteriorly, and completely tilled by a large oi>hthalmic 
lobe (figure 1, c). On the inner side of this sinus the frontal margin pro- 
jects in a small sinniform tooth, but outside, the margin is unarmed and 
curves regularly to the lateral angle. Just behind the orbital sinus there 
is a smooth and evenly curved depression in the surface of the carapax 
exposing a small area on the i)osterior part of the ophthalmic lobe, more 
fully described beyond. The cervical suture divides the dorsal surface 
of the carapax into two pretty nearly equal portions, and is deep and 
cons]»icuons, but is indicated in the lateral margin, each side, by a slight 
emargination only, which is scarcely deeper than the emargination be- 
tween the anterior and posterior lobes of the hepatic region. The 
lateral margin is armed, on the anterior lobe of the hepatic region, with 
(including the anterior angle) six small and slender spiuifom teeth di- 
rected forward, and on the posterior lobe with three more. The lateral 
margin, behind the cervical suture, is armed with seven similar teeth

which become successively more remote posteriorly. There is a slight 
median carina extending the whole'length of the carapax, and armed, 
behind the two rostral si)ines, first with a single small spine du^ected 
forward, then with two, side by side and very close together, then with 
one, then with two on the posterior edge of the cervical suture, then 
with two more, and finally with two somewhat larger and more widely 
separated spines projecting forward from the anterior edge of the broad 
and prominently raised posterior margin. In front of the cervical 
suture there is an irregular longitudinal dorsolateral line of five minute 
spines each side, and back of these a single spine each side on the pos- 
terior edge of the cervical suture. Extending from the posterior margin 
nearly to the cervical suture, there is a sharp sublateral carina parallel 
to the lateral margin, about a third of the way from it to the median 
carina, and armed with five small spines on one side and six on the 
other. The extra spine is on the left side, and next to the last in the 
series, but is accidentally omitted in figure 5, 

The ventral regions of the carapax are inflected each side at a very 
jicute angle with the dorsal surface, and, the sternum being narrow in 
front, the ventral regions are very broad in the middle, being broadest 
opposite the bases of the first and second perteopods. The ventral 
region each side is divided longitudinally into three approximately equal 
parts by two prominent cariuip ; the outer carina (marking the pleuro- 
tergal suture?) extends from the anterior margin at the base of the an- 
tenna, in a slightly sinuous line, toward the postero-lateral margin of 
thecnra])ax; the anterior half is very prominent and armed with nu- 
merous small spines directed outward, while the posterior half is much 
less conspicuous, unarmed, and disappears entirely l)efore reaching the 
posterior angle of the carapax. The inner carina extends along the 
branchial region from near the base of the first peneopod quite to 
the postero-lateral angle of the carapax ; the extreme anterior portion 
is not prominent, but from opposite the third per;eopo(l posteriorly it is 
very iiromineut, acute, and armed with ten to fifteen sharp spines. The 
outer of the tliree longitudinal regions thus marked out is divided trans- 
versely b;\' the cervical suture, and the anterior portion (subhepatic 
region) is divided transversely into an anterior and a posterior lobe by a 
groove nearly or quite as conspicuous as the cervical. In the frontal 
margin of this anterior lol)e (figure 2), and near its inner side, there is 
a deep sinus corresponding to the orbital sinus of the dorsal surface, 
but not quite as wide, and open nearly to the dorsal surface, except 
where it is crossed by a protuberance from the ventral portion of the 
ophthalmic lobe (c, figure 2). 

On the upper surface of the carapax, the orbital sinus, each side, is 
completely tilled by the dorsal part of the ophthalmic lobe, of which the 
iinterior margin is slightly concave in outline and continuous with the 
anterior margin of the carapax, but has a small tubercle near the mid- 
dle. The dorsal surface of the lobe is smooth, calcareous and opaque, 



348 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

and on a level Avitli the adjacent surface of the carapax except poste- 
riorly, where a small oval area of the extremity of the lobe is exposed 
by a dei^ression in the carapax. This oval area is thin, semitransluceut, 
and not calcareous, and has every appearance of being a true corneal 
area, although I am unable to detect any evidence of facets. The cara- 
pax along the margins of the sinus is in close contact with the ophthal- 
mic lobe bat is not really connected with it. From the lower portion of 
each ophthalmic lobe there is an elongated, cylindrical and somewhat 
conical, but obtuse and pointed, protuberance, of which the base rests^ 
in a transverse groove in the base of the antenna, whiJe the terminal 
Ijortion extends well across the open, ventral side of the orbital sinus. 
Upon the obtuse extremity of this protuberance there is a nearly circu- 
lar area similar to the cornea-like area at the posterior extremity of the 
dorsal part of the lobe. 

Unfortunately the specimen is not in sufficiently good condition to 
enable me to determine positively in regard to the structure of these 
cornea-like areas, but that they are connected with the optic nerves 
and are sensitive to light there is, I think, no chance for reasonable 
doubt. While it seems probable that all four of these areas are really 
faceted like the eyes of ordinary Podophthalmia, it is possible that they 
may be large, simple, or nearly simple eyes, like the eyes of some Aui- 
phipoda and Cumacea. The division of the ophthalmic lobe each side 
into two or more "eyes" has not, 1 think, before been noticed among 
the Decapoda, and is certainly an interesting fac': in morphology, but it 
is apparently not a character of much systematic or phylogenetic value. 
Among the Schizopoda, the lamellar expansion of the ophthalmic lobes 
in Amhlyops, and their broad expansion and partial union in Pseudom- 
nia, are quite as remarkable and apparently somewhat similar modifica- 
tions ; and Ampelisca and Biblijs, among the Amphii)oda, are cases in 
which there are two simple eyes each side, while in the closely allied 
Saploops the number aj)parently varies in the different species. 

The peduncles of the antennuhie (figures 1, 2) are very stout, being 
stouter even than the peduncles of the antennie. The basal portion of 
the proximal segment is longer than the two distal segments, is armed 
on the distal portion of the outer margin with two spiniform teeth, and 
the inner side is broadly expanded and j^rolouged into an acute scale- 
like appendage upturned and densely ciliated along the inner margin, 
anrl extending considerably beyond the distal segment and nearly as far 
as the tip of the antenna! scale {h, figure 2). The second and third 
segments are subcylindrical, and, as seen from above, are each about as 
broad as long, the second being somewhat larger than the third. The 
inner or major flagellum is about as long as the carapax. The minor 
flagellum is about as long as the peduncle of the antenna, about half as 
thick as the base of the ma/jor flagellum, of nearly uniform tliickness 
for two-thirds its length, then tapers rapidly to a very slender tip, and 
is thickly ciliated along the inner margin distally. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 349 

The three first segments of the peduncle of the antenna are very 
short, the three together being scarcely longer than the fifth segment. 
The first segment is loosely articulated with the sternum of the anten- 
nal segment, so as to he freely movable upon it ; it is very short upon 
the outside, but expands somewhat on the inner side, which terminates 
distally in a thin tubular process («, figure 2) arising from tlie oral side 
of the segment and directed upward to a level with the dorsal side so 
that, ill the ordinary position of the appendages, its orifice is closed by 
contact with the first segment of the peduncle of the anteuDula. This 
tubulai- process readily admits a large bristle which can be pushed 
through it round into the cavity of the segment itself. It undoubtedly 
contains the canal of the green gland. The second segment is small, 
closely united with the third, and bears upon its outer side a slender 
scale-like appendage {a, figure 1) Avhich reaches nearly to the tip of the 
peduncle, is about five times as long as broad, and thickly ciliated along 
both edges. The third segment, as seen from below, is almost wholly 
internal to the second, and is armed on the distal part of the inner mar- 
gin with a small spiniform tubercle. The fourth and fifth segments are 
subcylindrical, the fourth is slightly longer than the fifth, and both are 
ciliated each side. The flagellum is about as thick at base as the major 
flagellum of the antennula, but tapers rather more rapidly and is prob- 
ably considerably shorter. 

The buccal opening is nearly square. The bninchiostergites extend 
forward quite over the sternum of the antennary somite, and their an- 
terior extremities are applied to the basal segments of the anteunse, 
which, however, are freely movable upon the antennary somite. The 
epistome is short, not extending at all in front of the bases of the an- 
tenna^, is nearly on a level with the dorsal wall of the efferent passages 
from the branchial chambers and on a plane above the bases of the an- 
teniiiie, so that the efferent passages terminate in the space between the 
upturned edges of the squamiform processes of the inner sides of the 
basal segments of the antennulse and just beneath the short two-spined 
rostrum. In the middle of the slightly raised and regularly arcuate 
posterior edge of tht^ epistome there is a slight elevation with a tuft of 
hairs, as described and figured by Willemoes-Suhm in Willemoesia lepto- 
dactyJa. The anterior part of the endostome is on a plane somewhat 
above the plane of the epistome, but the space below is filled by the soft 
and fleshy labrum which projects considerably below the raised posterior 
edge of the epistome, and does not differ essentially from the labrum in 
Astacidaj or Scyllaridte. 

The mandibles are apparently wholly without molar areas, and ex- 
pand into very broad and thin lamella? sharply serrated along the cut- 
ting edges. The mandibular palpus is short and apparently composed 
of only two segments, the distal being shorter than the i^roximal. There 
may be an additional short basal segment, which I am unable to dis- 
cover without injuring the specimen, so that the palpus may prove to 
be triarticulate. 



350 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The lobes of the metastome (hibium) are very narrow and widely 
separated at base. 

The two lobes of the tirst maxilla are very much as des('ril)ed and 
figured by Willemoes-Suhm in WiUemoesia leptodacfi/la, the two lobes 
being very slender and strongly incurved, the anterior being the larger 
and having at its base a minute rudimentary a])pendage. 

The second maxilla has two small and very slender cudognathal lobes 
and a very large scaphognath, the anterior, or exogimthal, portion of 
which reaches nearly forward to the base of the antenna. 

The inner or endognathal lobes of the niaxillii)e<l arc small and rudi- 
mentary, but there is a very large and terminally bilobed lamella, ap- 
parently representing the exoguath, which extends forward considerably 
in front of the cpistomc, where its terminal lobes are somewhat upturned 
and serve as the lower wall of a tube from the efferent branchial open- 
ing. This lamella is continuous posteriorly with the very large e])ignath 
which extends far back into the branchial chamber. 

Both ])airs of guathopods are apparently (Mitindy without exognathal 
or epignathal branches. The iirst pair (second maxillipeds) reach 
scarcely beyond the ischia of the second pair, and the three «listal seg- 
ments are very short, the carpus being narrow at base but expanded 
and somewhat flattened distally, while the proi)odus and dactylu.^ taken 
together form a conical tip much shorter than the cari»us. 

The second pair of guathopods (external maxillipeds) are very slender, 
ciliated but unarmed with teeth or spines, and, v,'hen extended, reach 
nearly to the distal ends of the peduncles of the antennulic. The 
ischium is about as long as the three succeeding segments and only a 
little stouter than the merus, which is a little more than half as long, 
and the three distal segments are subcylindrical, of about equal length, 
and taken together are about as long as the merus. 

The terminal portion of each of the first pair of peraM)pods is wanting 
in the specimen examined, but the one on the left side is perfect to near 
the distal end of the merus. The coxa is very stout, far stouter than 
the succeeding segments. The basis is completely anchylosed with the 
ischium, which reaches to the tip of the second gnathopod, is much ex- 
panded distally, but at the same time very much comx)ressed dorso-ven- 
trally, and is smooth and naked. The portion of the merus which is 
still present is ab(mt i>()""" long, is smooth and ccmqtressed like the 
ischium, is of equal width with the ischium where it articulates with it, 
but is slightly expanded for about half its length, then slightly narrowed 
distally, and is armed near the middle of the outer edge with two small 
spines. 

The second peraeopods (figure 3) are slender, densely ciliated along the 
edges, and reach to the tips of the peduncles of the antenufe. The 
basis is anchylosed with the rather short ischium. The merus is con- 
siderably longer than the iscio-basis and reaches to the edge of the 
carapax. The carpus is a little shorter than the merus. The basal part 
of the propodus is a very little longer than the carpus, and is flattened

and somewhat expanded distally, where it is fnlly a third as broad as 
long ; the digital portion is very slender, nearly as long as the basal 
portion, nearly straight to the slender, acnte, and chitinous tip which is 
strongly eurved, and the prehensile edge is thin and very minntely ser- 
rate. The dactylus is almost exactly of the same form as the digital 
portion of the propodns, and its prehensile edge is armed in the same 
way, bnt the cilia npon the onter edge are much longer than on the cor- 
responding part of the propodns. 

The third and fourth ])airs of pera^opoils are successively a very little 
shorter than the second and have very nearly the same form. From the 
coxal to the meral segment they are very nearly as stout as in the second 
pair, but the three distal segments are much more slender. The basal 
part of the i^ropodus is subcylindrical and only very slightly expanded 
and tlattened distall,^•, while the digital part and the dactylus are equal 
in length, very slender and weak, straight throughout, without incurved 
or chitinous tips, and densely ciliated along the i:)rehensile edges. 

The fifth or last pair of perteoi)ods (figure 4) are considerably shorter 
and more slender than the fourth, aud all the segments except the pro- 
podns and dactylus have very nearly the same relative proi)()rtions as 
in that pair. The basal i)ortion of the propodns is a little longer than 
the cari)us, subcylindrical a>nd slightly tapering distally ; the digital 
portion is about as long as the proximal thickness of the proixxlus, very 
slender, and tapers to a rounded tii>. The dactylus is fnll^^ twice as long 
as and much stouter than the <ligital part of the pro]>odus, and straight 
and subcylindrical. 

As seen from above tlie sides of the pleon are nearty straight, and 
form, with the telson, a regular acute triangle. The first five segments 
are carinated dorsally, aud the carina projects forward from cacli seg- 
ment in an acute tooth, but the carina and tooth are small and low on 
the first segment, increase rapidly to the fourth, wl)ile on the fifth they 
are scarcely as prominent as on the fourth, and on the sixth the carina 
is inconspicuous and there is no tooth, but the top of the carina is 
traversed by a narrow longitudinal sulcus. On the first segment there 
are, in addition, two slender si)ines each side projecting forward above 
the articulations with the carapax. The dorsal surfixce of tlie i)leon, 
«nther side of the median carina, is smooth and scarcely at all sculptured, 
bur ah)ng the lateral margin, where the pleura bend abruptly and nearly 
perpendicularly downward, there is a series of deep longitudinal sulci, 
except upon the narrow first segment, which is unsculptured, and upon 
the sixth, where the sulcus is replaced by a simple carina. Of the 
pleura themselves, the first is nearly obsolete, the second is broader 
than deep, projecting back over the third with a broadly rounded mar- 
gin, and forward in a prominent but rounded angle, and has a central 
circular depressed area ; the succeeding pleura decrease regularly in 
size posteriorly, scarcely overlap when the abdomen is extended, are 
convex in outline posteriorly but straight or slightly concave anteriorly,

carina extending two-thirds of the lengtli, but not well marked upon 
the fifth. 

The telson is pretty regularly triangular, about twice as long as broad, 
is convex and slightly grooved longitudinally above, and terminates in 
an acutely rounded tiji unarmed with spines. The lamelUe of the uro- 
pods scarcely reach the tip of the telson ; the outer is nearly as broad 
as long, regularly rounded in outline, and stiffened by two shghtly di- 
verging ribs in addition to the thickening of the outer margin ; the in- 
ner lamella is stiffened by a single median rib, is nearly twice as long as 
broad, tbe lateral margins are approximately straight and parallel, and 
the tip is regularly rounded in outline. 

The first pair of pleopods are about 15""" long with an imperfect arti- 
culation at about a third of the way from the base to the tip ; the basal 
portion is somewhat triquetral, and the terminal portion expands into a 
smooth, naked, and thin lanceolate lamella slightly concave posteriorly. 
The second pair of pleopods are about 24'"'" long, and the base and 
lamellfc are of about equal lengths. The lamellae are narrow, lanceo- 
late, and thickly ciliated along the edges ; the inner lamella is slightly 
broader than the outer, and bears the two styliform processes usually 
chara(5teristic of males among the Macrura. These styliform processes 
are about 3""" long, and arise together at about a third of the way from 
the base to the tip of the lamella ; the inner, like that upon the three 
succeeding pairs of pleopods, arises from the slightly thickened inner 
edge of the lamella, is ridged, of nearly equal width to the rounded tip, 
and nearly naked except a line of cilia along the posterior margin. The 
outer process arises just in front of the inner, and its base is at a right 
angle to that of the outer ; it is more slender than the outer, tapers dis- 
tally, and is ciliated on both edges and on the anterior surface. The 
three succeeding pairs of pleopods are similar to those of the second 
pair, but are successively a little shorter, and they want the outer of the 
two styliform processes on the inner margin of inner lamella.

Owing- to the imperfectioDS of the descriptions of the species of the 
'< WiUemoesia group," tdready known, it is useless to attempt to point 
out which of the characters above alhided to are common to all the 
species |or only specifically or generically (if there be more than one 
genus among- the species now known) characteristic. 

In regard to the openings of the green glands it may be well to notice 
that Willemoes-Suhm was unable to discover them in Willemoesia lepto- 
dactyla. He might easily have overlooked them, however, if they were, 
as is probable, situt^.ted as in our species. One of Bate's figures of 
Fentacheles anthrax (Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist., V, ii, pi. 13, fig. 2,, 
1878) apparently shows the tubular process just as it exists in our 
species, although I find no reference to it in the accompanying text. 
Bate subsequently, however, appears to allude to this same process as 
" the olfactory tubercle of the second or outer antenna," though I can- 
not find that he anywhere alludes to Willemoes-Suhm's inability to dis- 
cover the openings of the green glands.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SOIVIC: GENERA AND SPECIES OF AI.ASKAN 
FISHES. 

By TARtETON H. BEAN. 

The collections of the United States National Museum contain many 
Alaskan fishes, two of which are here described as new to science. 

Cottus polyacanthocephalus Pallas. 

This species has some points in common with Boreocottus axillaris 
Gill. I cannot find, in the description of the genus Boreocottus, any- 
thing to separate it from Cottus. The specimens here described are 
numbered 23499 in the Museum register. They were collected at 
TJnalaska, by Mr. William H. Dall, and were catalogued in his note- 
book at No. 900.

preo])ercular spines, two of" which are at the angle; the longer of these 
is half as long as the npper jaw, and extends nearly as far back as the 
opercular spine. The distance between the eyes equals their long diam- 
eter. The fourth spine of the first dorsal is as long as the intermaxillary 
band of teeth of either side, and is nearly i as long as the head. The 
ventral terminates at a distance from the vent, and is e(pial in length 
to the maxillary bone. The pectoral reaches to the end of the spinous 
dorsal, and to the vent. The length of the head is contained 2^ to 2 J 
times in the total length without caudal. The length of the upper jaw 
^equals half the length of the head; the lower jaw is sHghtly longer, but 
is received within the upper. The ground color is dark brown ; the 
sides and tail are more or less distinctly mottled and banded with 
yellowish. The spinous dorsal has two and the soft dorsal three oblique 
dark bands. The anal has four oblique dark bands, the first and last 
being very narrow. The pectoral has three irregular bauds of dark 
brown intermingled with yellowish. The caudal is indistinctly banded 
with dark brown and tipped with yellowish.

Melletes papilio sp. nov. 

The only specimen of this species in the Museum collection is the 
type of the present description ; it is catalogued at number 23751 of the 
Museum Fish Eegister. The length of the example, measured to the 
origin of the middle caudal rays, is 185 millimeters. It is an alcoholic 
specimen in excellent condition. 

Description.— By length of the body is to be understood its length 
from the tip of the snout to the origin of the middle caudal rays. The

body is iiioderately elonjiate, rather sleuder, somewliat compressed 
posteriorly, has a narrow band of scales close to it« dorsal outline, and 
is otherwise naked with the exception of a few prickles on the sides. 
The head is naked; it has two small cutaneous appendages on the chin, 
one near the end of each maxillary, two above the eyes, two on the 
vertex, and one near the upper angle of each gill-opening. The bran- 
chiostegal membrane is fi*ee from the isthmus posteriorly. 

The greatest height of the body (.25) is one-fourth of its length, and 
equals the length of the external caudal rays (.25) ; its height at the 
ventrals (.23) is contained 4^ times in the length. The least height of 
the tail (.07), equals the distance between the eyes (.07), and the length 
of the antecedent spine of the second dorsal (.07). The length of the 
caudal peduncle, measured from the end of the second dorsal to the origin 
of the middle caudal rays, equals half the length of the maxillary (.16). 

The greatest length of the head to the end of the opercular flap (.37) 
is contained 2f times in the tength of the body, and equals twice the 
•length of the mandible (.185); its greatest width (.23) equals the length 
of the base of the spinous dorsal (.23). The distance between the eyes 
(.07) is contained 3 times in the length of the second (.21) and third 
dorsal spines. The length of the snout (.09), or the distance from the 
end of the snout to the orbit (.09), equals the long diameter of the eye 
(.09), and half the length of the upper jaw (.18). The length of the 
maxillary (.10) equals twice the length of the caudal peduncle, and half 
the length of the anal base (.32j. The length of the mandible (.185) 
equals half the length of the head, and is contained 5J times in the 
length of the body. 

There are two obtuse spines on the snout, two above the posterior 
parts of the orbits, and two on the vertex, the last four being provided 
with short filaments. I can find none on the spines of the snout. There 
are two minute, barbel-like filaments on the chin, and there is one short 
cutaneous tag close to the end of each maxilla and on the membrane at 
the upper angle of the gill-opening. The type is well preserved, but a 
little stiffened by long immersion in very strong alcohol. 

The distance of the spinous dorsal from the snout (.30) equals 2i times 
the length of its first spine (.12). Its length of base (.23) equals the 
greatest width of the head (.23). The second and third dorsal spines 
are equal, their length (.21) being contained nearly 5 times in the length 
of the body. The fourth dorsal spine is the longest (.22) ; its length is 
contained 4 J times in the length of the body. The length of the fifth 
dorsal spine (.20) is contained 5 times in the length of the body. The 
last dorsal spine (.055) is shorter than the antecedent spine (.07) of the 
second dorsal. The longest ray of the second dorsal (.175) is half as long 
as the distance of the pectoral from the snout (.345) ; the last ray (.035) 
is half as long as the antecedent spine. 

The distance of the anal from the snout (.59) is nearly twice that of 
the spinous dorsal from the same point. The length of the anal base 
(.32) is twice that of the maxillary. The longest anal ray (.15) is twice 



356 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM, 

as loiiji' as the last (.075). The tips of tlie anal rays are free from the 
membrane, some of them for a distance equal to one-half the dianierer 
of the orbit. 

The length of the middle candal rays (.235) is contained 4:^ times in 
that of the body ; the length of the external raj's, four times. 

The length of the longest iiectoral ray (.395) is nearly twice that of 
the tifth dorsal spine ; it extends to the vertical through the root of the 
sixth anal ray. 

The distance of the ventral from the snout (.27) equals three times the 
long diameter of the orbit. The length of the longest ventral ray (.49) 
is nearly one-half that of the body ; it extends to the vertical through 
the root of the seventh anal ray. The tips of the rays extend beyond 
the membrane, in one case about a third the length of the tin. The 
ventrals are furnished with stiff setae on their under surface, following 
the course of the rays.

Color. — The ground color of the upper part of the body is a light 
grayish brown, on which are four markings of a darker brown, of which 
the first three are band-like and extend below the lateral line, while the 
fourth is widest below and sends only a narrow point below the lateral 
line. Between the third and fourth large body-markings there is a 
small blotch of similar color beginning at the lateral line and extending 
downward a distance equal to about | the long diameter of the orbit. 
At the base of the caudal is a band-like marking similar in color to the 
body-markings, and the posterior half of the caudal bears two obscure 
bands of brown ; between the brown markings there is an area of yel- 
lowish white. The top of the head is sienna brown. The cheeks are 
brown of a darker tint than the rest of the head. The lower parts of 
the head are yellowish white, as are the bases of the pectoral and the 
anterior part of the belly. The lower parts of the body are grayish 
white, dotted here and there with spots of milky white. The largest of 
these milky white spots are not more than | as long as the orbit. The 
belly has some similar spots, resembling in this respect the male of Coi- 
tus scorpius subspecies fjronlandicus, but the spots are much smaller 
than in that species. The spinous dorsal is mainly very dark brown 
with two light areas in its anterior and posterior parts. The second, 
third, and fourth body-markings are continued upon the soft dorsal ; 
that proceeding from the fourth body-marking, however, is continued 
forward forming a margin for the upi)er posterior part of the soft dorsal. 
The ground color of the pectorals is a grayish brown. On this ground 
color the upper portion of the fin, on its anterior surface, has several 
bands of milky white bordered with sienna brown ; the lower part of 
the anterior surface is mottled with nearly linear markings of sienna 
brown bordered with milky white. The markings of the posterior sur- 
face of the pectoral correspond in the main with those of the anterior 
surface; but the tips of the membrane between many of the rays are 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 357 

milky white. The ventrals are strealved and spotted witli sienna brown 
and milky White on both surfaces, the membrane close to the third ray 
having a regular alternation of these brown and white spots. The anal 
is grayish brown sparsely mottled with spots similar to those on the 
ventrals. The peritoneum is silvery white. 

The length of the intestine is equal to the distance from the tip of the 
snout to the end of the anal fin. The genital papilla is short, about 
equal in length to the opening of the vent.

longest dorsal rays are a little more than half the length of the head. 
The anal begins almost directly under the origin of the dorsal and has 
nearly the same extent ; its longest rays equal or slightly exceed the 
longest dorsal rays. The ventrals originate in advance of the dorsal 
and can be made to reach to or slightly beyond the origin of the anal. 
The vent is immediately in front of the beginning of the anal. About 
77 scales in lateral line ; 11 rows between the dorsal and the lateral line

My BR. ELS^IOTT COUES, U. S. A. 

The zlppendix to the "Birds of the Colorado Yalley- (pp. 507 [lJ-784 
[218]), which gives the titles of "Faunal Publications" relating to North 
American Birds, is to be considered as the first instalment of a "Uni- 
versal Bibliography of Ornithology''. 

The second instalment occupies pp. 230-330 of the " Bulletin of the 
United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories 'V 
Yol. Y, No. 2, Sept. G, 1879, and similarly gives the titles of "Faunal 
Publications" relating to the Birds of the rest of America.. 

The.third instalment, which occnpies the same "Bulletin", same Yol.,, 
No. 4 (in press), consists of an entirely different set of titles, being those 
belonging to the "systematic" department of the whole Bibliography^ 
in so far as America is concerned. Here come the titles of all publica- 
tions relating to particular species, genera, or families of American Birds, 
systematically arranged, hy families, and in chronological order. 

These three previous instalments represent a nearly complet^^ Bibli- 
ogi-aphy of American Ornithology. 

This present, /o«r^A, instalment of the worlv is of the same character 
as the first two: that is, it relates to "regional" or "faunal" as distin- 
guished from "systematic" ornithology; and it undertakes to do for 
British Birds what the first two did for American. 

That is to say: here belong the titles of all publications treating of 
British Birds as such, exclusively, and indiscriminately or collectively. 
In publishing these preliminary instalments, it is necessary to draw a 
hard and fast line between those titles which are and those which are 
not to be found in each one of them — a line which would be very evident 
to one cognizant of the plan of the whole Bibliography, though by no 
means obvious at first sight. It is therefore necessary for me to bo 
exjjlicit here. 

In order to fall within the scope, of this fourth instalment, a publica- 



3G0 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

tion must relate to Britisli Birds as such. Secoudly, it nuist relate to 
British Birds exclusively. Thirdly, it must relate to liritish Birds of 
more thau one species, geuus or family. For, tirst, a i)ublicatiou ou, 
say, LaruH (jlaucus and Tringa canutus as observed in Greenland does 
not belong- here, though both these species are British Birds. For, sec- 
ondly, a work on the Birds of Europe does not belong here, though 
including all British Birds. For, thirdly, a paper on the occurrence of 
Ph(daro])us lujpcrhoreus in Great Britain, or one on the habits of Lar/ojms 
scoticus, does not belong here, as the scheme of the whole work carries 
one of these to Fhalaroiwdidcv, the other to Tdraonkla\\\\ the "system- 
atic" department of the whole Bibliography; though a paper on Pha- 
Jaropits liyperhoreus and Lagopus scoticus as observed in Great Britain 
would belong here, being a "faunal" publication, and a "British" one. 

This instalment, like (hose which have preceded it. is to be considered 
only in the light of published proof-sheets, to be canceled on the final 
appearance of the whole work. They are thus published in advance for 
several reasons — among others, both to render available certain depart- 
ments of the Bibliography which approach completion, and are therefore 
useful as far as they go, and to invite suggestions and criticisms for the 
bettering of the whole work. This British list is prepared with the 
«ame great care to secure good results which was bestowed upon previous 
instalments, and it is hoped that the severe tests to which it will doubt- 
less be subjected will prove it to be no less accurate than its predecessors 
have been found to be. Accurate, as far as it goes, I believe it to be; 
but I know it to be very incomplete. I do not think that it contains 
more than one-half as many titles as belong to this department of the 
Bibliography. I earnestly hope that the omissions, as well as any other 
defects that publication of my manusciipt discloses,. may be brought to 
my notice by those interested in the completion of the work. 

There are numberless historical, statistical, geographical, agricultural, 
even political publications, which contain lists or other notices of British 
Birds, no hint of the fact being given in their respective titles; and it 
is my aim to include everything that claims to be ornithological by a 
formal heading of any sort. Very few of these "by-ways of bibliog- 
raphy " have been accessible to me in America. Xor have [ ever been 
able to lay hands on a file of The Fidd, nor have 1 indexed certain peri- 
odicals past 1874. These sources, to say nothing of others I could men- 
tion, should yield upwards of a thousand titles not here given. I am so 
fully aware of the deficiencies of this instalment that criticism on this 
score would l)e futile. My manner of arranging the titles, moreover, is 
accoixling to the plan of the whole work, scarcely to be appreciated as 
yet. But these two points aside, I ask for, and hope to receive, the 
severest criticism to which such literary work can be subjected. I should 
esteem it a great favor to receive back this i^amphlet from ibs possessor 
with any errors corrected, any omissions supi)lied, or any bettering of 
my comments on the publications the titles of which are here given; 



PEOC'EEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 361 

and 1 sliould be luippy to recoguizc sucli courtesy by returning- a copy 
of the whole Bibliography as soou as published. 

lu couducting this work, I habitually regard The Title as inviolable, 
— to be transcribed in full, verhatm, literatim et xnmotuatim. In the case 
of a book, this means a traus(!ript of the title-page, with vertical bars 
( j ) to indicate the adjustment of the typography. With this is given 
the complete collation. In the cases of papers published in periodicals, 
I gWv tlie full title, -with the page on which the article ends as well as 
that on which it begins, with illustrations if any — in short, all custom- 
ary or requisite l)ibliographical data. Difterent editions of the same 
work, even if identical, are regarded as separate publications. 

Except in certain cases, where the contrary is expressly stated, no 
title in this Bihlioijraphij has been tal-en at second-hand. 

Many friends, both in England .and in my own country, have been 
pleased to express their interest in this work, and their hope for its 
successful completion. To each of them, I beg to tender my sincere 
thanks : and I may be permitted here to refer, in an especial manner, 
to the encouragement, advice and assistance which I have constantly- 
received, during years of toil, from Professor Alfred Kewton, of Mag- 
dalene College, Cambridge.

The matter of these two editions is substantially the same, if not identical, but the type 
appears to bav(v b(tcu reset throughout : the title and ctdlatiou differ, as v.'ill be seen on com- 
paring them. Tlie Government T'rinting Office has no font that will exactly reproduce the 
Greek quotation of the IGOU ed., though coming very near it ; moreover, the orthography and 
accentuation of the motto differ in the 1 wo eds.— The orig. <>d. must be very rare ; Engelmann 
does not give it, citing the ed. of 10(37 as the lir.st. and noting another of 1704. There is a copy 
of each of the two earlier eds. in the I'liila. Acad. Libr.

Ixi-ciii, i-ix, 1 folded sheet of music. (Vol. Ill, 1776, Eeptiles and Fishes. 
Vol. IV, 1777, Crustacea, Mollusca, and Te.stacea.) 

The orig. ed. was 1766, q. v. The 2d ed. is said to date 1768.— There appears to have been 
really no 3d ed., but only a second issue of one of the others, doubtless the 2d. 

O&s.— It is said that there were two issues of date 1776-77, one in 8vo, the other in 4to, both 
entitled "Fourth edition". The difference is probably only in the size of the paper, the 
typography and impression being identical. I find among my slips two titles, both relating 
to this same 4th ed., but taken at different times from different copies ; both "8vo ", but the 
collation not identically the same (there being pp. i-viii and 5 unpaged leaves in one, not in 
the other). There are several unpaged pages in the work, which may be bound in different 
places in different copies, or left out of some. So I let both titles stand, though they refer to 
the same edition of the same work. The main text, pp. 1-418 in Vol. I, and pp. 419-786 in 
Vol. II, together with the plates i-ciii, + i-ix + 1 sheet of music, are absolutely the same. See 
next title. 

It is not easy to cite the title of this work, as every line of it, excepting the first, changes 
with successive volumes. The eng. titles to Vols. I and II differ again from each other and 
from the printed titles. The work is ostensibly anonymous, but few authors are better 
known than Thomas Pennant. This edition, being the fourth, makes many changes in colla- 
tion from an earlier one. Vols. I and II include the Birds, preceded by the Mammals in Vol. I.

"The following "Worli contains the description and manners of nearly all our Uritish birds, 
with a figure of each, copied by the Author from nature. . . . The particular merit this 
"Work is entitled to, lies iu the figures being faithful copies of nature ; and that it adds alittlo 
to our knowledge of the manners of birds." (Retract from Preface.) A few of the plates are 
copies from Brisson, and others. The author drew most of them from fresh specimens; 
others from specimens in the Parkinson and Latham museums : the di-scriptions of these 
latter being from Latham's "Synopsis." The engravings are of half -page size, heading a 
page, the rest of the page being text, backed blank ; many leaves of generic characters are 
interpolated. There is no pagination, printer's signature or numeration of the i)lates. Some 
250 species are thus treated, the work thus consisting of as many sheets, plus the interpolated 
sheets of generic details. The sequence of the species appears to bo nearly that of the 
Lmna?an Systema Jf aturai, beginning with Yultu7; and ending with Caprimulgus.

This is the editio princeps of "White's Selborne"; from which, with or without the "Cal- 
endar" and "Observatictos," which were incorporated in 1802, flow numberless editions, 
variously edited and modified. . 1 give nearly all of them in this bibliography ; but see 
especially Newton, as just cited. 

The famous work is ostensibly anonymous ; but the author's name, "Gil. White." ajxpears 
on p. V. of the " Adv(>rtisement ". The pi. opp. p. 259 represents Gharadrius himantopus. 

"Many as our English Naturalists have been, and among them men endowed with so much 
excellence as to ensure their taking and holding a rank not inferior to that enjoyed by the 
naturalists of any other nation, there is but one whose writings have i)laced him among Eng- 
lish classical authors. This one is Gilbert White ; and his best known work, The Natural 
History and Antiquities of Selborne, has only to be named to ensure its respectful if not 
rapturous reception by all classes."— iV[a<. 13 July, 1720 : ob. 26 June, 1793.

This is clearly a "bookseller's book", made out of Albiu's "Natural History of English 
Song Birds ", with nearly the same plates, and the text almost word for word in various places, 
as I ascertain by direct comparison ; variously padded in other places. The illustrations are 
substantially the same, but with the eggs mostly erased from the plates. One may always sus- 
pect an anonymous book which parades some gi-eat man's name on the title-page, as Buffon's 
in this case. — Compare 17.59, Albin, E.

Each plate is dated, so that the dates of publication. may be ascertained for the whole 
series— the redeeming feature of the work. Engelmann gives "(96) 108" plates: but I find 
in the copy examined the series of (3X38=) 114 'complete, though some of the sheets aro 
wrongly numbered, being coiTccted in msc. 

Given a snob with an "entire new system of ornithology,'' — a royal chaplain for a patron, — 
and a reverend pedagogue to correct and embellish the text, all together on one engraved title- 
page — and the infallible result estops criticism. The Canary bird, and some pigeons and 
poultry, are included in the "Oecumenical History, of British Birds."

Not seen : title and comment from A. Newton. 

"According to the youthful translator's preface, the original has much chaff (Sprett) in it, 
but also some corn that is worth transplanting into German soil, which he therefore conde- 
scends to extract, warning his readers, however, that the book is not for the learned, but 
only for such as wish to entertain themselves with a little knowledge. The extracts so put 
together entirely lose their epistolary character, though the translator keeps up the name. 
Thus White's first six letters to Pennant are condensed by Meyer into his "Erster Brief," 
while the last and " Vierzehnter Brief" is compounded of part of "White's fifty-eighth to Bar- 
rington, with a single paragraph from his next, and the final paragi'aph of the whole Xat. 
Hist. Sell. The translation is not very accurate, and the editor's remarks are inserted in the 
text, V)etween brackets, often with a sneer."

the date of the German ed., which Ag. and Strickl.'do not give, unless this be intended for it.

This is perhaps the most ornate, or luxurious, work ou iJiitish Song Birds of the last cen- 
tury, and it ought to remain in some sort a '-standard" treatise, notwithstanding N. "Wood's 
fiat. The text is prepared with great care for accuracy, and tlie plates are highly coloured —

This is a well known and notable treatise, not common now. It was probably published in

"THE Reverend Mr. "White, so agreeably known to the public by his Natural History of 
Selborne, left behind him a series of yearly books, containing his diurnal observations on the 
occurrences in the various walks of rural nature, from the year 1768 to- the time of his death 
in 1793. From these annals he had already extracted all the matter comprised in the work 
above mentioned, down to the middle of 1787, but several curious fiicts in the preceding num- 
bers bad not been thus employed; and all the subsequent ones -remained untouched. It was 
thought a mark of respect duo to his memory, and to the reputation ho had acquired as a 
faitbful and elegant observer, not to consign.these relicks to neglect. The manuscripts were 
accordingly put into my hands for the purpose of selecting from them what might seem wor- 
thy of laying before the public. The present small publication is the fruit of my research. 
..." (Editor's advertisement.) 

The '-Calendar" and "Observations" were thus originally printed as a separate book, but 
Were incorjjorated in many of the subserfuent editions of the Xat. Hist. Ant. Selborne. 

It contains the following bird-matter: "Observations on Birds": pp. 57-91: — Birds in gen- 
eral— Rooks— Thrushes— Poultry— Hen Partridge— A hybrid Pheasant (frontisp. or opp. p. 
6o) — Laud Rail — food of the Ring Dove — Hen Harrier — Great Sjieckled Diver, or Loon — Stone 
Curlew — Smallest Willow Wren — Fern Owl or Goat Sucker — Sand Martins — Swallows, con- 
gregating, and di.sappearancc of— Wagtails— Wryneck— Grosbeak. This matter comes in 
the ])art of the book entitled ••Obser%-ations on various jiarts of nature", following the "Cal- 
endar".

1797-1804. Bewick, T.— Coulinncd. 

Vol. I, Land Birds, 1797, of tlie cditio imnceps, originally appeared in two issues. Vol. II, 
Watpr Birds, 1804, appeared in one issue of a number of copies equal to tbe number of copies 
of both issues of Vol. I. The text of Vol. I is by Beilby; that of Vol. II by Bewick. The 
two vols, are thus really two separate works ; but as they both together make up the editio 
princexis, I have combined the titles of the two in one, hypotheticaUy ; not knowing, how 
ever, that the title of Vol. II may not be worded more differently from that of Vol. I than as 
indicated above. The bracketed statement of price, in the title, no doubt varies in different 
copies. Also, was not Vol. II printed by E. Walker? Vol. I is said to contain 115 figures; 
Vol. II, 113; making 228 in all. About '>0 of the figures are said to have been drawn from 
subjects in the Wycliffc Museimi. 

It appears that there havb been eifjlit regular editions of "Bewick" (exclusive of three edi- 
tions of the cuts alone). They are as follows : 

1797-1804. Editio princcps, ut supra. 

1805. Second Edition. iSTewcastle. E. Walker. 2 vols. 8vo. 

1809. Third Edition. Newcastle. E. Walker. ?

J. Hancock.) 

"Supplements", one to each vol., were introduced with the 5th ed., 1821. Each successive 
edition, or each to the Gth, has accessions ; thus, the Cth, 1826, contains 300 (157 Land, 143 
Water) figures of British Birds, besides 14 of exotic Land Birds. 

The separate issues of figures only are three in number, viz : 

1800. J'irst issue. Cuts of Land Birds only, without text. 8vo. (How mauj^ copies?) 

1817. /Second issue. Cuts of Land and Water Birds, without text. 4to. (25 copies.)

Class II, Birds, pp. 31-152. Thus more than half the work is devoted to oraithology. 
It is a systematic treatise on the subject, in due fonn, and has the appearance of being a val- 
uable contribution. 

"Mr Low's merits, as a laborious and accurate observer of Nature, were, it is believed, 
scarcely known beyond the narrow circle of his particular friends; and it is to be regretted, 
that a recent historian* [*the Kev. George Barry, D. D. in his History of Orkney, 4to. 1805.] 
has not scrupled to avail himself of the advantages which this obscurity offered to a plagiary. 
It having been the Editor's fortime to procure the MS. Fauna Orcadensis of Mr Low, he now 
begs leave to lay it before the public, in the fonn in which it was left by its Ileverend Author. 
It appears to have been revised by the late Mr Pexxaxt, as it contains a few corrections in 
that gentleman's handwriting. The Editor trusts that it will bo foimd to afford au interest- 
ing and valuable addition to the Natural History of the British Islands, and prove fai' more 
useful than the closet compilations of some modern zoologists." (Extr.from Editor's Preface.)

The author having found Dr. W. E. Leach's Catalogue of ISIG difficult to use, on account 
of the newness of many names, he thought that a Catalogue with Leach's and more custom- 
ary names put together would be u.soful; hence this work. Some of the names here given 
are curious; for the author says: "I have attended to generic and specific differences, and 
thereon founded a nomenclature, regardless of modem names, whenever they appeared to 
disagree with facts ; but at the same time adhering as much as possible to the views of Aris-

scattered through extensive treatises, and the transactions of learned societies,— to state the 
species which have been recently discovered, — and to correct those errors in synonyma, which 
the difference of feather in different ages, or at (certain times in the year, has freqiu^ntly pro- 
duced." {Extr. from Preface.)

.and 1833. 

There is great difficulty in arriving at the dates of this work. I have handled a complete 
set of the plates, but that one is dated 1841, being thus a reissue ; it is furnished with a new 
title-page, worded differently from any of the earlier titles. I have not been able to see the 
work in the parts in which it appeared, nor even as first issued on its completion in 1834. 
According to information accessible to mo (including Lizars' own advt. sheets, pub. with Nat. 
Libr., "Vol. I, 1833), these folios were published in 19 parts, at intervals of about six months, 
from 1821 to 1834, both inclusive. This gives the date of each, approximately. They form 
two series: I. Land Birds, in 8 parts; II. ^Tater Bird.s, in 11 parts; designed to form two 
vids. On their com])letion, in 1834, the series were bound in two vols., with a litlo said to 
run as follows: 

• ' The Figures of British Birds, containing an exact and faithful representation, in their 
full natural size, of all the known species found in Great Britain," etc. 

The two series together are said to consist of 228 plates, of 383 figures ; but they are num- . 
bored in such a slovenly manner, with so numerous interpolations, including some lettered 
instead of numerated, th.it the number can only be ascertained by actual count. (See the 
enumeration which I give under date of the reissue, 1841.)

After the title and six pages devoted t<» the genus Syloia, come 16 plates, each with its leaf 
(2 pages) of text, paginated only to p. 24 ; then 14 unpaged pages belonging to the last 7 plates, 
and then 6 pages of "Additional Kemarks". The sixteen species treated and tigund are: 
1, Sylvia rubetra. 2, S. phcenicurus. 3, S. luscinia. 4, S. hortensis. 5, S. cinerea. C, S. tro-

These, of course, do not all belong to the genus Sylvia, as now understood. The plates are 
numbered to correspond with the ligiires here given. The mistake on the title-page is nota-

always accurate, ' British Birds ' of Bewick. In the above year appeared the 'British Ani- 
mals' of Dr. Fleming, a work which had no small share in introducing into this coimtry the 
improved systems of modem zoology. The genera adopted are for the most part those of 
Cuvier's 'llogne Animals', and tbe specific descriptions and remarks, though brief ar<> in

Thiseclitioii differs from the iirat in the dispersion of the original Intiodiutiou tliro;ii;!i tlic 
vidume iu alphabetical order of subjects treated; in substitution of .i new Introducfio-.i (]ip- 
i-lx) which presents a "Plan of study", discusses various systems very pointedly, and trives 
an eclectic List of works recommended, their authors being classified as 1) rudimental. 2) 
literary, 3) philosophic, naturalists ; in very considerable alterations in the arrangement of 
the body of tlie work; in addition of much new matter marked between asterisks; iu alpha- 
betical index of scientific names; and changes of five names, viz: Anorthtira, p. 0; Xyr.ticheli- 
don, p. 33, gg. nn. ; Fringilla spiza, p. 78; IlotaciUa lotor, p. 377; Corvus prcedatoruis. p. 4:29; 
Anorthura communis, p. 570, spp. nn. Anorthum and Nyctiehelidon are proposed as substi- 
tutes for Troglodytes and Caprimulgus respectively, on the ground of the inapplicability of 
the latter names. 

Supposing a new edition of Montagu to have been advisable, I must confess that 1 do not 
see that Rennie did not edit it in a satisfactory manner, or wliy the critics attacked liim .so 
promptly and so pointedly. See Philos. Mag., x, 1831, pp. 370-379, 429-433 ; Loudon's 2Iaj., iv,

At this date, Vol. I, which originally appeared in 1825, was reissued "with additions", and

"The author, having often derived pleasure from watching the habits of birds, thought 
that a familiar introduction to this branch of Natural History might prove useful to ladies 
and young persons, who were not desirous to enter on scientific descriptions, or to encounter 
works of greater length. "With this inteution the following pages have been written, com- 
prising extracts from several writers on the subject, together with a few original observa-

rorming the first of the series entitled the "British Library ". 

This forms Vol. I of the series called the "British Library", and seems fo \w the tirst issue 
of Brown's edition. The "Antiquities" are omitted, and the woodcuts are few in number 
and of moderate quality. 

There are many more editions of the Capt. Brown series: see 1834, 1835?, 1840, 1843, 1845.

This is now known to have been edited by Lady Dover, iind is dedicated to her son, H. 
A[gar] E[Ui8], subsequently Lord Clifden. It is the first "Bowdlerized" edition, chiefly re- 
markable for the omission of several letters (as Xos. 28, 30, 32 and 33 to Barrington) and shorter 
passages. But the intention was good, and the book has consequently found its way into 
boys' and girls' hands, who have derived much profit from it. The woodcuts also are pretty.

London: | M. DCCC. XXXV. Part of 1 vol., large 8vo, not paged, 17 coloured

The above is a temporary half-title issued with what is really Part 1 of a treatise completed 
the same year, the present publication being intended to form a portion of one giving 33 
plates. It comprises 17 plates of the resident Song Birds, the other part giving 16 plates of 
the summer migrant Song Birds. See what is said under the other head of this date and 
author. See .also same author at 1836.

1 vol. large 8vo, not paged, 33 coloured plates. 

This is the complete edition of the whole work. The first Part, published 1835 with a half- 
title-page, contained 17 illustrations and text, of as many of the "Kesident Song Birds." On 
the appearance of the second Part, with 16 illustrations of the "Summer Migrant Birds", 
in 1835, it was directed that the title of the first Part be canceled, the above title substituted, 
and the two books merged in one, containing the 33 plates. The two books, nevertheless, are 
foimd separately bound, and are citable separately. It will be seen, however, that the above 
title, issued with Part II, covers both, Part II having no title of its own, and Part I having 
no other than its own title, to be canceled. The general preface, published with Part II, is 
to precede the preface to Part I in the make-up.

iilled a leal waut of the time, for a couveni(!nfc reliable handbook which should give a fair 
idea of a classification, and describe species recognizably. It treats of upwards of 300 spe- 
cies, with diagnosis, a few leading references, description and general comment on habits, 
distribution, &c. Preceding the treatment of the species is a concise characterization of the 
genera and higher gi-oups ; the full genera recognized being 111, with numerous .subgenera. 
The whole matter is very faithfully executed. However moderate a performance it may 
appear to-day, it was a great boon to the student, who had then mostly to rely upon his Flem- 
ing or his Montagu. 

I am under the impression that there are some new names— at any rate some new combina- 
tions of generic and specific terms— in this Manual.

on Natural History which the author had prepared, when he put it out as a feeler ; designing 
to commit the rest of "the labour of Thirteen Tears" "ad ticum et piparem" if it should not 
be well received. I may add that I have seen none of the rest.

The last 2 vols, having thus a tliffcivut inii.iiiit from that i>f the tirst 3, and beina; separated 
therefrom by a considerable interval of tini- ((Imiii- wliirli Enjielmann's Bibl. appeared), the 
work has somotimes been cited as of only :i vols. P.nt the 5 vols, are continuous and uniform 
parts of cue "History." 

This is Macgill'iviay's opus maijiin.m ,• not to be confounded with his " Manual '" in 2 vols., 
1840-t2. 

Opinion differs greatly rospectiu.u; the merit of Macgilliviay's work, and it is not easy to 
decide in a case whore one's estimate must depend so much upon wh(ither one likes the author 
or not ; for this writer's personality colors his work throughout, and almost necessarily im- 
liresses itself upon the reader. For instance, Macgillivray is to me personally so agreeable a 
companion, that I doubt not that my warm appreciation of his ability and acquirements is 
<ipcuto a charire of favoritism. His writings attract me strongly; and possess for me the 
n:ini(ltss I'.isiiniitiim that thousands have felt in perusing the pages of Gilbert White or of 
Ahxanilcr Wilson. .\[,iru,illivniy appears to have been of an irritable, highly sensitized tem- 
pi lanicut, tircil witli cuthusiasiu and ambition, yet contending, for some time at least, with 
poverty, ill-health, and a perhaps not well-founded though not therefore the h^ss acutely-felt 
sense "of neglect; thus ceaselessly nerved to jvccomplish, yet as continually haunted with the 
dread of failure. The result of such an unstal)lc (Mpulibrium as this will dei)end mostly upon 
circumstances; there is the impetus within, but the direction it takes will be along the line 
of least resistance. This author was undoubtedly unwise in his frankness : but diplomacy is 
a stranger to such characters. The strength of our universal instinct of self-preservation 
sometimes converts an attitude intended to be simply defensive into (me positively oflensive; 
and Macgillivi-ay's way of handling people whom he disliked or despised often savored of 
arrogance. It may be doubted that there, was really any " holier than thou " feeling at heart, 
whatever his seeming assumption of sup.-rior knowledge or greater love of truth in compari- 
son with his peers. If be never hesitated to differ sharply with any one, or to express his 
own views pointedly— if he scarcely disguised his contempt for tritlers, blockheads, pedants, 
compihu-s. and theorizers— if he was also fallihle. even as the rest of us— he was nevertheless 
aloverof n:itur.\ an original thinker, a hard student, and, finally, tin ornithologist of large 
practical experience, who wrote down what he knew or believed to be true with great regard 
(for accuracy of statement and in a very agi-peablo manner. 

I suppose this elaborate aud extended "History" to bo one of the most accurate and reli- 
able of the many which handle the same subject : and it is doubtless, to many besides my- 
self, one of the most mitertaining. I am competent to judge of the fidelity of Macgillivray 's 
pictures of bird-life only in the instances of birds commim to America and Europe ; but in 
such cases they tally well with luy own experiences; aad when writing descriptions of the 
form and colors of birds, I find it of no lit t le assistance to have Macgillivray 's page before me 
as well as the specimens themselves, '('here is no iiuestion of this author's ai^curaey and 
dearuess in describing specimens in h;ind. 

Besides the specific d.^scriptions wliicli form most of the text of tliis work, tliere is a good 
deal of general ovuit'.iolo- , in the matters of classification and anatomy— the lat t ci csiiccially 
relating to the stru<-tu!-e of tlic diuestive system, upon which the author's classilic at ion is so 
lar-'ely based. For :\[ it .iillivrav, it will be reniembered, discovered or invciitnl for himself 
a classification of hiicls, which has at least thti merit of being original with him, and of rep- 
resontiu'j: conclusions derived from ;utu;d observation. He developed his system consist- 
ently, and published it with express uut'oncern for its fate at the hands of others; he liked 
it, and if others did not, so much the worse for them— did they expect him to furnish br^iqs 
also ; The outline of this system may be seen from the above title. Though based upon 
anatomical structure, it is, in lact, one of the purest physiological or sr>-called " teleological" 
classifications we have had ; worked out upon the adaptive modifications of certain organs. 
It thus proceeds upon what appears to an Evolutionist of to-day to be a radiciilly false pre- 
mise: aud its agroement in any points witli a schem:- based upon i)ur,-ly morphological con-

siderations of the theory of descent must be regarded as rather fortuitous thau essential. At 
the time he wrote, Evolution had no place in taxonomy ; to-day, we utterly discard any scheme 
of classification, however convenient or however specious, that docs not proceed upon the 
understanding that all birds are descended from a common ancestor, and consequently bear 
to each other simply the relation of parent and offspring ; that classification is entirely a 
matter of our skill or luck in tracing pedigree to construct a genealogical table ; and that 
there is no such entity in nature as a genus or a species was supposed to be when Jytacgilli- 
vray studied birds. 

A marked feature of this work is the numerous chapters on "Practical Ornithology", that 
is to say, on field work in this branch of science. These are given in the form of personal 
narrative, with gossipy incident and imaginary dialogue,— the hint of which seems to have 
been taken from the similar sketches of scenery and character which Audubon introduced in 
his "Ornithological Biogi-aphy ". They reflect many reminiscences of the author's intimate 
personal relations with the "American backwoodsman ". These two seem to have been very 
congenial spirits ; and what jolly times they must have had o' nights, after their tramps, in 
some snuggery with a bottle between them ! . . . 

William Macgillivray has one very high claim upon the regard of American ornithologists : 
he was the source of Audubon's inspiration in all that pertains to the technic of the latter's 
great work. " Not to put too fine a point upon it," he furnished nearly all the "ornithology" 
of Audubon's work, as distinguished from the portraits that the Frenchman drew either with 
pen or with pencil. Audubon was primarily, and chiefly, an animal painter, and ho finally 
acquired no little familiarity with bird-life ; but he began to paint without the slightest idea 
of ornithology, and never atiained even mediocrity as a strict scientist. He loved warmth, 
color, action ; he liked to exaggerate and "embroider", and make his pages glow like a hum- 
ming-bird's throat, or like one of his own marvellous pictures ; he had no genius for accuracy, 
no taste for dull, dry detail, no care for a specimen after ho had drawn it. Macgillivray sup- 
plied what was necessary to make his work a contribution to science as well as to art. In 
fact he wrote a good deal of Audubon's book. After Audubon had told us how his heart beat 
when the woods echoed to the report of his gun, and he picked up a lovely warbler which he 
had long souglit for, but until then in vain— conveying an impression of years of solicitude 
about something that he probably never thought of till he stumbled on it accidentally— after 
all this, and the execution of a beautiful plate, Macgillivray would furnish his friend a tech- 
nical name and description. The anatomical matter of Axulubon's work is jirobably all Mac- 
gillivray's ; and the final classification and nomenclature are from the same source. It will 
be remembered that the names and whole arrangement of the birds in Audubon's Orn. Biogr., 
1831-39, were changed in the Synopsis, 1839, and in the 8vo ed., 1840-44. This was entirely due 
to Macgillivray 's hand in the matter. Macgillivray is accredited with several of the biogra- 
phies in Audubon's volume ; but the full extent of his joint-authorship is not generally known. 
There seems to have been some mutually satisfactory understanding between the two, which 
has never been made public. I allow these facts to go on record, not in the least to the dis- 
paragement of a brilliant and famous author, but in simple justice to a stronger, sounder, 
and no less agreeable ornithologist.

"Many recent wood-engravers have approached Bewick, but none have yet equalled him. 
Among the most successful of these the Messrs. Thompson of London must be specially men- 
tioned. Their woodcuts in Tarrell's ' British Birds' are beautiful works of art ; in delicacy 
of execution they often exceed the engravings of Bewick ; but the occasional stiflness of atti- 
tude in the birds, and a conventional sketchiness in the accompaniments, indicate the profes- 
sional artist and not the self-taught child of iSTature. The beauty of Tairell's 'British Birds' 
is much enhanced by improvements in the preparation of paper and ink, and in the mode of 
taking off the impressions which have been introduced since Bewick's time. It is probable 
that if the wood-blocks of Bewick, now in the possession of the great engraver's family, were 
intrusted to one of our first-rate London printers, an edition of Bewick's ' Birds ' could be now 
produced, far superior in execution to any which was issued in the lifetime of the author." —

The pleasure of handling the admirable and most attractive publications of which the

These illustrations originally appeared in 19 parts, in two series, 1821-1834: First series, 
Liand Birds, 8 parts; second series. Water Birds, 11 parts. They came out at intervals of 
about six months, during the years specified. In 1834, on their completion, they were made 
up in 2 vols., and furnished with permanent title-page, differing entirely from the above, 
which is a new title furnished with Bolm"s reissue of this date. See 1821-34, 182.5, 1825-33, 
1833-4, and 1834, Selbv, P. J. 

The .series ostensibly consists of 65 + 4 + 103 = 172 plates ; but, by actual count, in the 

oopy examined, there are 21 interpolated plates in vol. i, and 34 interpolated plates in vol. 

ii ; making 172 + 55=^227 ; but there are 8 plates missing from the numeration in vol. ii, 

.md 1 from that of vol. 1, leaving 218 as the actual number. I find the work cited as of 

"228'" plates, of 383 figures-.

This is nu interesting and valuable series of articles ou Irish ornithology, each having, after 
the running part of the title here given, a modified caption which I omit in order to bring the 
series together. It is in some sense a prodrome of the author's standard treatise which 
appeared later. Tliompson was very active in these matters for some years, as his numerous 
contributions to various periodicals testify.

This is the original issue of the Ilarpeis' American reprint of the Ladij Dover edition, l)eing

of the successive issues, as follows:— 1842 (two), 1847, 1853, 1855, 1859, 1868. 

It is a reprint of the 'Bowdlerized' edition (London. 1833), "arranged for joung persons", 
for which we are indebted to the mother (Lady Dover) of H. A[gar]. E[llisl. Wliite said 
little not virginUms puerisque. but was castrated nevertheless. It is a curious thing about 
this ed. that all Ww woodcuts in the first part (to Pennant) are reversed, while those in the 
second i)art (to Barriugton) are not. A new woodcut is introduced at p. 223, instead of the 
original of tlic Mistletoe Thrush.

1842-50, Mey^er, H. L. — Continued. 

to 1843. The present 8vo edition was also published in parts, 1842-50, hut the number and 
dates of them are unknown to me. It is said to resemble the orig. 4to ed. Ln all respects 
except in size. I see cited an 8vo ed. as of "1852"; is itanything more than other copies of 
the present? 

Of the plates of Birds, there were published in Vol. I, pU. 1-45 ; Vol. II, pU. 40-90 ; Vol. HI, 
pU. 91-135; Vol. IV, pll. 130-180; Vol. V, pll. 181-225; Vol. VI, pll. 220-270; Vol. VH, pll. 271- 
322. The rest of the plates, 110 in number, making up the 432, are of eggs. I don't know in 
what order thej' appeared, but suppose one or more of them with each part of the work.

The greater part of this interesting book (pp. 11-125) is devoted to Birds, the remarks upon 
which are extended, but too miscellaneous to be here briefly characterized. The treatise 
is perhaps the most notable of all the Englisli local 'Fauaaa', after "White's 'Selborne', and 
has even been compared with the latter without disparagement. It covers a wide range erf 
topics, contains great store of information from original observations, and is agreeably as 
well as carefully written. It is now long out of print, and scarce : a new edition has appeared 
(1879), with notes by several eminent naturalists, and a long career of prosperityjieems to 
attend "Lubbock".

of all, the blocks, which were not in tlie least injured by former impressions, having been

intended the printing of this edition, and made considerable alterations in its arrangement

added in 1856.) 

This is a systematic treatise on all the Birds knovni to occur in Ireland, very interesting 
and reliiible, by a gentleman whose numerous detached papers on the same subject, no less 
than the present work, show him to have been a close, accnrate and faithful observer for a 
period of years, and whose results are sufficient to place him among the very first writers on 
this special subject. It may be not inapt to compare him with his Scotch compeer, Macgil- 
livray, at least in originality, fidelity, and diligence. The work is a practical out-of-doora 
ornithology, carefully digested in the study, with abundant consultation of other writers.

"In sending forth a Third Edition of his 'Ornithological Rambles,' the Author has not 
thought it necessary to make any essential alterations in the former part of the work, but 
those who may fe«l an interest in the occurrence of new or rare species withiu the limits of 
the county, will find some additional information on this subject in the Sy.stematic Catalogue 
at the end of the volume." 

The original lithographs, after the author's drawings, having been worn out, are superseded 
in this ed. by four of "Wolf's spirited illustrations. 

1855. Morris, B. R. British | Game Birds | and | Wild fowl. | By | Beverley R. Mor-

col'd i)lates. 

This is a beautiful and luxurious volume. The text is of general character, for the most 
part a leaf of it to a plate. Some 60 or 70 species are treated. The plates are brilliant; and 
if the author had numbered them, so that I could cite them, I would do so with pleasure. 

I imagine, without knowing, that the work may have been published iu parts, not necessa, 
rUy all of the date above given.

I am very imperfectly acquainted with this work. The editidu here cited, which I suppose 
to be a "3d ed., 2 vols., 1856 ", is neither dated nor paged, has the species arranged systematic 
cally, with the addition, at the end of VoL II, of ]5 species to the 229 before treated, raising 
the total number of plates to 169, each representing the egg of one or more species, in 
coloin-s, natural size. The work was originally published (by subscription) in parts. I find 
• it cited "8vo, London, 1831-1844'', and also "3 vols, 8vo, London, 1831-1836".

CopjTi'ight 1841, q. v., the date of the orig. issue of the American reprint of this edition, 
which was several times issued at irregular periods, a few hundred copies at a time. A note 
to me, recently (1879) obligingly furnished by the publishers, giving memoranda of the dates 
of successive issues, includes one of " 1859," but npt one of 18G0. As I have handled a copy 
dated 18G0, it may be that 1859 was the actual date of issue of copies post-dated "1860," rather 
than that there was one of 1859 and one of 1869 too. 

This is apparently a very faithful reprint of Lady Dover's edition (cf. 1833), from which 
most of the woodcuts are reproduced, those in the first part (to Pennant) being reversed, 
while those in the second (to Barrington) are not. However, two (pp. 31 and 223) are substi- 
tuted for the English originals, and do not reflect much credit on the draughtsman.

which the work treats. The regular text is not paged ; it consists of a sheet or so to each 
plate. The pll. are not numhered. They were not issued in any systematic order; hut are 
designed to he rearranged systematically in 5 series, one to each vol. as ahove indicated, and 
are enumerated conformably to the printed lists ; being citable by number according to these 
lists. The plan of i>ublication is thus like that of all the rest of Gould's famous works. I 
have only seen the woik as made ur, and cannot, therefore, give the cover-title l)y which it 
was alone known for so many years, and which diifers from th(> permanent title above cited. 
" This grand work, which was begun in 1862, is continued at the rate of two parts every 
year. The plates, as regards beauty and finish, far exceed those in any other of the author's 
well-known publications. ... A good deal of care has been bestowed on the letter-press, 
which is much more comprehensive than in the majority of Mr. Gould's books. Figures of 
the nestings of many of the species are also introduced to an extent greater than in any other 
work of the kind with which we are acquainted, excepting perhaps Kaumann's 'Vogel 
Deutschlands.' " {Zool. Rec. for 1864, i>. 42.)

This interesting and beautifully illustrated volume contains an account, more or less 
detailed, of all the birds figured in the 2d ed. of Tarrell, with additions to date. The author 
makes out the British list to be: resident all the year, 140; summer visitors, 63; winter 
visitors, 48 ; capricious visitors, 110 ; total, 361. The author has certainly, as he ventured to 
hope, provided the lover of nature with a pleasant companion in his country walks, and the 
young ornithologist with a manual which will supply his present needs and prepare him for 
the study of more important works.

Not less than 225 species of Birds have been found in Middlesex, of which 60 are resident, 
68 migratory, and 97 rare and accidental visitants. The plan of the work is modeled after 
Tarrell. The musical notation of the notes of various birds are given. The work is -ivi-itten 
by a well-known and accomplished field ornithologist, and has a high standing ; being, in fact, 
the chief authority upon the birds of this locality. It is based entirely upon h:s personal ob- 
servations in the field, and may be regarded as perfectly reliable, besides being written in an 
interesting manner. Cf. Ibis, 1867, p. 123.

Montagu's celebrated ' Dictionary ' was originally published in 2 vols, in 1802, with a sup- 
plement in 1813. The additions which the author made exceeded the original work in bulk. 
Kennie's edition, being the 2d, appeared in 18:jl. 

In the present greatly enlarged and modified edition the whole of his 'Dictionary,' 'Sup- 
plement,' and 'Appendix' are reprinted in a combined and alphabetical order, the words 
"supplement" and "appendix" beingprefixed to whatever is derived from these two sources. 
"Nothing that Montagu has published is omitted or altered." Newm.in's additions, chiefly 
derived from Selby, Tarrell, and the pages of the 'Zoologist,' are marked by inverted com- 
mas, with references to those works. Immediately after a name is inserted a reference to the 
bird and its egg, Yarrell's 'History' (3d ed.) and Hewitson's 'Oology' (3d ed.) being selected 
for this purpose ; these and other editorial interpolations being bracketed. 

This is the most convenient form in which Montagu is found, this author's origin.ally sep- 
arated inst.alments of his work being here brought together in proper order, .and much new 
editorial matter of value being added. 

The editor says:— "I desire explicitly to state that I have taken nothing from the text of 
the original work ; and in the second place, I have added scarcely anything of my own : in no 
instance have I overlaid the original with my own observations, altered the author's obvious 
meaning to suit my own views, or attempted to controvert his assertions because at variance 
with my own more limited experience : nevertheless important additions have been maile, as I 
will endeavor to explain." The gist of the additions are -.—a) 24 species added by Selby to 
those of Montagu ; 59 in Tarrell additional to Selby ; 21 more in the Zoologist, and 2 in the Ibis;

total, 106 species added to Montagu's lists. 6) references to the figures of TarrcU's 3d ed. 
c) to Hewitson's 3d ed. for eggs, d) references to otlier WTitings, as tlio Zoologist or the 
Field newspaper. All the editorial additions are in brackets. The editor's list of British 
Birds closes the volume. The page is very closely printed, in double column. Cf. Jbin, 18C0,

"The extreme richness of tho Ornithology of the county appears to have early attracted the 
notice of Norfolk naturalists, and fortunately the records of their observations are to a great 
extent preserved to us, though scattered amongst ' Transactions ' of Learned Societies, and 
other publications, not always accessible to the general reader. To combine a r6sum6 of the 
facts thus handed down to us, with the result of personal observations extending over several 
years, was the idea that first originated the present work ; and there is, perhaps, no better 
motive for incurring tho labors and doubtful honors of authorship than a desire to supply to 
others a want that has been jiersonally experienced. " (Preface.) Cf ii<is, 1807, p. 238, where

the work is highly spoken of. "A most carefully elaborated work on that part of England 
which has probably the richest omis. The introduction describes at some length the general 
features of the county, and the changes which have been produced in its avifauna of lat« 
years, chiefly through improved agricultural practice."

There is no date in the title-page, but I believe this edition appeared in 1870 or 1871. The 

woodcuts, mostly by Mr. Wolf, are very superior, and the foot-notes are by "T. B." (Prof. 

Bell). A stetch map of the district is introduced to face p. 1. Altogether it is an excellent 

edition and admirably meets the purpose for which it was intended.

pages in Part X), pp. 161-238; Part SIX, Oct. 1878, pp. 239-318; no more seen. 

The publication of TaiTcU's work began July, 1837, and ended May, 1843. A second 
edition appeared in 1845, and a third in 1856, but a few months before the author's death. 
The 2d and 3d were substantially reprmts of the first, though with some additions and alter- 
ations. During the thirty years the literature of the subject nearly doubled, and there was 
a great increase in the knowledge of the subject after the third edition appeared. A new 
edition was demanded, not only by the public at large but by those who held the earlier 
issues; and it was the heaviest task of the editor of the foiu-th to sift the enormous mass of 
new material at his service. The editor did not scruple to make such systematic changes as 
he considered necessary, nor to scrutinize closely the claim of any bird to bo considered 
British. The scientific names were retained, as given by Tarrell ; but the editor also prefixed 
names according, as far as possible, to the Rules adopted by the British Association, hoping 
thus to ultimately reach a more uniform nomenclature. The third edition was embellished 
with 550 woodcuts ; the present is to contain nearly 600. 

The editor has thus liir executed his self-imposed task with the utmost care, fidelity, and 
success; but of a work thus in process of publication a full notice must be deferred.

This is a considerable list, with sliort miscellaueous notices of each species. Jt is entirely 
remodeled from the old Pulteuey list, to which reference is made. The anthor had the co- 
operation of several accomplished ornithologists in revising the nomenclature, and appears 
to have brought the subject fully up to date in all the requirements of a local list.

may easily he seen, on comparison, to be copies of his masterpieces, and not printed from the 
blocks which illustrate bis well-known Britinh Birds. The edition is otlierwise very well 
'•got up-" The editor has freely altered such of his predecessors notes as seemed to require 
amendment, and of course many did. To face p. 385 is inserted a facsimile copy of the same

In this edition the author's "Natural History" ends with p. 292, to which follow the com- 
parative "Calendar'^ kept by "VFhite and Markwick, and then Mr. Bucldand's notes, extend- 
ing ovi-r i>p. 309-to8. The author's "Antiquities" occupy pp. 459-555, .and on p. 559 begins 
Lord Selbornes " Appendix," which ends at p. 574. The volume is profusely illustrated by 
woodcuts ; but, except the views of the place and its neighborhood, few ot them have any- 
thing especially to do with White or Selbonie. The same may be said of the editor's 
"Notes"; and the "Memoir" gives little information about the author that was not known 
before. As a whole, the edition has served to amuse the general readei-, but can never be 
deemed by a naturalist to be worthy of the author's memory. Lord Selborne's contribution 
excepted. The new letters (five in number, lent by ilr. J. W. Edgehill, of Culter, Aberdeen) 
bear date from November, 1774, to January. 1791, and are addressed to the writer's nephew 
Samuel Barker, his sister Mrs. Barker, his niece Anne Barker (2), and his brother-in-law 
Thomas Barlcer. To the first is pi-efixed a poetical "Invitation to Selborne," which consists 
of a great part of the poem "Selborne," afterwards printed with amplifications, combined 
with some lines subsequently incorporated with the well-known "Naturalist's Summer Even- 
ing 'Walk." One of the letters to Anne Barker, dated February 5, 1785, is nearly identical 
withthe already published sixty -third letter to Barrington. To face p. xxii is a photogiaph of 
a portion of the letter there printed, and on p. 473 is a woodcut representing in facsimile the 
last entry in the burial register of Selborne, signed by "White as "Curate," June 10, 1793, 
followed by the certificate of his own burial, July 1, 1793, signed "Ch. Taylor— Vicar. "

This is an admirable piece of bibliography, by one from his boyhood a diligent disciple of 
"White, and for many years a careful collector of the dilferent editions of his principal work ; 
it gives a far more complete list of his wi-itings than had before appeai-ed. It was originally 
prepared, the writer states, for Dr. Elliott Cones ; and has been mainly relied upon in tlie

a lasting memorial of a well-spent life. Lubbock's volume, written flve-and-thirty years ago, 
has long been out of print and scarce ; and the reliable nature of the information which it

"Although we are unable to understand how any necessity can possibly hiive ari'sen for 
another edition of White's 'Selbonid,' throe different editions having appeared within the

brevity of his notes; we should like to have added also in the accirracy of them. . . . We 
cannot say much for the engravings. The best are copies (electros, we presume), of Wolf's 
illustrations to Johns' 'Biitish Birds and their Haunts,' engraved by Whymper. These 
were chaiming when they first appeared, but as they have been published some seventeen 
ye.ar.s, and have been used over and over again in different books, many of them are much 
worn, and the impressions consequently are not satisfactory." (Zoologist, 1. c.)

"My object in giving publicity to this littlo work has been solely to excite a love for the 
study of the feathered tribes— to place in a popular form the true economy of birds, showing 
thrir relations and positions in ^Nature's great system; . . ." The pages are attractive, as 
would bo expected from tlie author's modest yet firm preface; though many persons may, as 
he feared they might, wish he had spent more time among books, if not less among birds. 
The volume is quite original, presenting some fresh facts, and discussing many interesting 
questions. It brings the flavor of the woods and fields. 

The volume is reissued at Boston, Mass., by Estes and Lauriat, who purchased the stereo- 
type plates, and caused a new preface to be written by Dr. Coues, the American editor. The 
text, however, is identical. (It is just now— May, 1880— coming out.)

Not seen. — Orig. ed. 1771, q. v. This is a photolithographic reprint of the scarce tract, re- 
duced in size from the folio original to demy 8vo ; it is issued by " The Willoughby Society," 
formed in 1879 for the purpose of reprinting certain ornithological works of rarity or utility, 
and is the first of the series undertaken. 

"In a Preface by the Editor, Professor Newton, a few particulars are given concerning 
the author, Mannaduke Tunstall, the reader being reminded that a memoir of him is gi\en 
by Fox in his ' Synopsis of the Newcastle Museum,' published in 1827. His museum, includ- 
ing his collection of birds, which, it is said, cost him several thousand pounds, foi-med the 
basis of the Museum at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and from specimens contained in it were drawn 
twelve of the figures of birds in Brown's 'Illustrations of Zoology,' ahA fifty of Bewick's well- 
known engravings. This catalogue is interesting for its 'rarity' rather than its 'utility,' 
since it contains no desciiption.? — merely a list in English, Latin, and I'rench, of the species 
known to the author as British." {Zoologist, Apr., 1880, p. 159.) 

ADDITIONS AND CORKECTIONS. 

For most of the following additions and corrections I am indebted to Professor Newton, 
who kindly examined many of the press-proofs, but whose valued emendations, though com- 
municated with the utmost expedition, reached me too late for incorporation with the body 
of the article.

from J. E. Cri-ay, who added that he gave Bennett the information — but Hanmer 
is spoken of (p. xxvii) as being merely one of the editor's friends who assi.sted 
him— the others being Latham, Hawkins [who seems to have furnished notes on 
birds of Greece], Henry Jenner (nephew of the great man) and Hugh Davies — the 
additions of the latest being mainly or wholly on Invertebrates. On the other 
hand, the anonymous author (probably Neville Wood) of a memoir of Latham 
(Kat. iv. p. 31), speaking of Latham's revision of this work, which he seems to 
regard as the ' second edition ' of Pennant, says it ' was published by his son, Mr.

The orii;. eel., 1 vol. folio, dates 1706, q. v. The 2d ed., 3 toIs., 8vo, dates 1768. The ed. of 
1770, 1 vol., 8vo, must count as the third. There are two issues of dal e 177G-77, each in 4 vols, 
one 8vo, the other 4to. These two issues, though each bearing the words "Fourth Edition" 
on the printed title-pages, are absolutely distinct— the plates in each being printed on paper 
of different sizes. Ornithology begins in the 8vo at p. 153, and in the 4to at p. 133.— Whence 
it appears that in the body of this Bibliography I have got the editions of Pennant badly 
mixed up, and otherwise very defective.

I have made a bad break in citing this work as of "2 vols, in one", with "48" plates, and 
of dates "1794-95." 

According to Prof. Newton's memoranda, the work is in 10 vols., with 244 plates, of dates 
1794-1819.— Vol. I, 1794.— Vol II, 1795.- Vol. Ill, — ? ; "new ed." 1815; after "By E.Dono-

1797-1804. Bewick, T. History of British Birds. . . . 

Respecting the two issues of Vol. I, Laud Birds, 1797, Prof. Newton remarks: "The typog- 
raphy of these two issues is wholly distinct; the difficulty at first is to say which of them 
was the earlier. I believe this may be decided by looking at p. 71, lines 5 and 6, where the 
words "bill, nostrils, and even nuind the eyes" of what seems to be the oldest issue are 
replaced in the later by "bill and nostrils, as far as the eyes"— the last expression being 
retained in subsequent editions. On the other hand, on p. 145 we have, in what I take to be 
the earlier issue, '"Schceniclus" which in the later is still farther corrupted into '' Sahaini- 
clus"; but on the reverse of p. 335 in one issue the third ed. of Bewick's "Quadrupeds" is 
announced as lately published, while in the other the announcement is that the fourth ed. of 
th.at work "speedily will be published"; which seems to be final and decisive." 
The 3d ed., 1809, is said to bo the worst, owing to bad paper. 

In the 8th ed., 1847, some of the woodcuts have utterly failed, but the majority show details 
better than in any other ed.
