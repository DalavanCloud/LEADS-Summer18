ADVERTISEMENT. 

The extension of the scope of the National Museum during the past 
few years, and the activity of the collectors sent out in its interests, 
have caused a great increase in the amount of material in its possession. 
Many of the objects gathered are of a novel and important character, 
and serve to throw a new light upon the study of nature and of man. 

The importance to science of prompt publication of descriptions of 
this material led to the establishment, in 1878, of the present series of 
publications, entitled "Proceedings of the United States National Mu- 
seum," the distinguishing peculiarity of which is that the articles are 
published in signatures as soon as matter sufficient to fill sixteen pages 
has been obtained and printed. The date of publication being plainly 
expressed in each signature, the ready settlement of questions of priority 
is assured. 

The articles in this series consist : First, of papers prepared by the 
scientific corps of the National Museum ; secondly, of papers by others, 
founded upon the collections in the National Museum; and, finally, of 
interesting facts and memoranda from the correspondence of the Smith- 
sonian Institution. 

The Bulletins of the National Museum, the publication of which was 
commenced in 1875, consist of elaborate papers (monographs of families 
of animals, &c), while the present series contemplates the prompt pub- 
lication of freshly acquired facts relating to biology, anthropology, and 
geology; descriptions of restricted groups of animals and plants; the 
settlement of particular questions relative to the synonymy of species, 
and the diaries of minor expeditions. 

This series of publications was commenced in 1878, with volume I, 
under the title " Proceedings of the United States National Museum," 
by the authority and at the expense of the Interior Department, and 
under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The present volume, constituting the sixth of the series, has been pre- 
pared under the editorial supervision of Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, curator 
of the department of fishes.

PRELIMINARY REPORT ©IV THE BRACHYURA AND ANOMURA 
DREDGED IN DEEP WATER OFF THE SOUTH COAST OF NEW 
ENGUAND BY THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION IN 1S80, 
1881, AND 1883. 

By SIDNEY I. SMITH. 

This report is intended to be supplementary to my preliminary notice 
of the Crustacea dredged in the same region in 18S0 (these Proceedings, 
iii, pp. 413-452), and to include all the species of Braehyura and Anomura 
obtained off' Martha's Vineyard at depths greater than 50 fathoms. 
The Crustacea dredged off* the mouth of Chesapeake Bay in 1880, and 
off the capes of the Delaware in 1881, will be the subject of a separate 
report, but the specimens from these dredgings are included in the fol- 
lowing lists of specimens examined as far as the species to which they 
belong are contained in the present report. 

A few of the species described as new in the preliminary notice above 
referred to were almost simultaneously described by A. Milne-Edwards 
in one of the reports of the Blake dredgings, under the supervision of 
Alexander Agassiz, in 1877, 1878, 1879 (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cam- 
bridge, vol. viii, No. 1, December 29, 1880), of which I had no knowledge 
whatever until after my paper was printed (January, 1881), and which was 
not published until after my last proof had been returned to the Public 
Printer (December 24, 1880). I have had much difficulty in identifying 
Milne-Edwards's species, but have adopted his names wherever it was 
possible to recognize his species. In determining some of these spe- 
cies I have been greatly aided by the kindness of Prof. Walter Faxon, 
who has sent me for examination some of the type specimens in the 
Museum of Comparative Zoology.* 

The last season's dredging off* Martha's Vineyard reveals the total, 
or almost total, disappearance of several of the larger species of Crus- 
tacea which were exceedingly abundant in the same region in 1880 and 
1881. The most remarkable cases are those of Euprognatka rastellifcra, 
Collocles robustus, Catapagurus Sharreri, Munida Caribccaf Smith, and 

* While the manuscript of this report was in the hands of the printer, the follow- 
ing work of Milne-Edwards was received : Recueil de figures de Crnstace's nouveaus 
ou pen connns. lere livraison. April, 1863. A considerable number of Milne-Ed- 
w.>. V new species are provisionally figured in this work, but it does not seem to 
make ai,; r changes in the proofs of the following pages necessary, except under Anop- 
lonoiw poliiux, which was doubtfully referred to Elasmonotus in the original manu- 
script, but for which the new generic name has been inserted in the proof. — May 29, 
1883.

Pontophilus brevirostris, all of which were exceedingly abundant in 1880 
and 1881 ; but of the first two not a specimen was taken the past season, 
of the Mitnida only a single specimen, and that on the last trip, and of 
the other species only a very few specimens. Lambrus YerrilUi, Acan- 
thocarpus Alexandria LatreiUia elegans, Homola barbata, and Anoplonoius 
politus, which were each taken several times in 1880 and 1881, were 
none of them taken in 1882 j they were far less abundant than the other 
species, however, and the non-occurrence of some of them was very 
likely accidental; but the disappearance of part of them at least was 
undoubtedly due to the same causes which occasioned the disappearance 
of the more abundant species. The disappearance of these species was 
undoubtedly connected directly with the similar disappearance of the 
tile-fish (Lopholatilus) from the same region, and on this account 
specially I give in detail, for many of the species enumerated beyond, 
the tables of specimeus examined from the region explored by the Fish 
Commission; and to these I have usually added tbe specimens which 
I have examined from the collection made by Alexander Agassiz on the 
Blake in 1880. All the species mentioned above as having disappeared 
in 1882 were specially characteristic of the narrow belt of comparatively 
warm water (approximately 50° F.), in from GO to 160 fathoms, which 
has a more southern fauna than the colder waters either side. Professor 
Verrill has suggested (Amer. Jour. Sci., Ill, xxiv, p. 306, 1882) that 
there was a great destruction of life in this belt, caused by a severe 
storm, in the winter of 1881-82, which agitated the bottom-water and 
forced outward the cold water that even in summer occupies the great 
area of shallow sea along the coast, thus causing a sudden lowering of 
the temperature along the warmer belt inhabited by the tile-fish and 
the Crustacea referred to. 

In the following tables of specimens examined the latitude and longi- 
tude, depth, nature of bottom, &c, are copied from the list of dredging 
sfations of the Fish Commission for 1880, 1881, and 1882, in the Bulletin 
of the Fish Commission, vol. ii, pp. 119 to 131, 1882, where further details 
in regard to temperature, &c, are given. In indicating the nature of 
the bottom, the Coast Survey system of abbreviations is used. In the 
column for the number of specimens examined, I is used to indicate large 
specimens ; s. small specimens ; and y, young. When the sexes were 
not counted separately the whole number of specimens examined is 
placed in the middle of the column ; when the sexes were counted sepa- 
rately the number of males is put on the right, the number of females 
on the left, and the number of young in the middle, followed by the letter 
y. As a basis for ascertaining the breeding season, I have, in a great 
number of cases, noted the presence or absence of egg bearing females ; 
when the number of such females was counted it is entered in the ap- 
propriate column ; when specimens carrying eggs were found, but not 
counted, a plus sign, -f, is used; and when none of the specimens ex- 
amined were carrying eggs a zero, 0, is used.

In the original description above referred to it is stated that this 
species resembles Amathia Carpenteri Xorman (Seyramathia Carpenteri 
A. M.-Edwards) ', it is, however, probably not closely allied or even 
congeneric with that species, but apparently closely allied to Amathia 
crassa A. M.-Edwards, and possibly identical with it. I was misled in 
regard to the armament of the carapax of JScyramathia Carpenteri by 
the woodcut given in the Depths of the Sea (no description of the species 
has yet appeared), for Milne-Edwards states that the species is closely 
allied to Scyra umbonata Stimpson, certainly a very different species from 
Amathia Agassizii, and has united them in his new genus Scyramathia. 

As indicated above, all the specimens seen are males. One of these 
is much larger than the larger of the two original specimens described 
and figured in my report above referred to, but differs very little from it, al- 
though the spines of the horizontal series on the branchial region, above 
the bases of the cheliped and first ambulatory leg, are considerably 
longer, and there are two well-developed spines, instead of two or three 
small ones, on the lateral margin back of the anterior angle of the buc- 
cal area. Measurements of this specimen are given in the last column 
of the accompanying table of measurements. The other specimens show 
all gradations between this and the young specimens originally de- 
scribed.

Amathia Tanneri, sp. nov. 

Allied to the last species, but readily distinguished from it by the 
narrower carapax with longer and less diverging rostral horns and fewer 
and more nearly equal spines, and by having a single spine only on the 
base of the antenna. 

Male. — The carapax, excluding the rostral horns and the spines, is 
about as broad as long. The rostral horns are nearly straight, much 
less divergent than in A. Agassizii, and, in the larger of the two speci- 
mens seen, much more than half as long as the rest of the carapax. 
The supraorbital spine and the postorbital process are as in A. Agassizii, 
but the basal segment of the antenna is unarmed except by a single 
spine at the distal end. There are four long and approximately equi- 
distant spines on the mesial line of the carapax, the two anterior on the 
gastric region and smaller than the others, which are on the cardiac 
region, the posterior being near the posterior margin and projecting 
slightly backward over it. There are no prominent spines on the gas- 
tric region except the two median, but there is a minute tubercle or ru- 
dimentary spine either side about equidistant from the two median, and 
on the cardiac region there are no spines or tubercles whatever except 
the two median. There is a single long hepatic and a great branchial 
spine, as in A. Agassizii, but there are no other spines or tubercles on 
the branchial region except two, about as long as the cardiac spines, and 
about equidistant from each other and from the great branchial, the 
posterior gastric, and the anterior cardiac. The anterior angle of the 
buccal area projects in a dentiform process either side, as in A. Agassizii, 
and back of this the prominent margin of the pleural region is armed 
with three small tubercles or rudimentary spines. There are no spines 
or tubercles on the side of the branchial region above the basis of the 
cheliped and first ambulatory leg, and no tubercles whatever on the 
posterolateral margins. 

The chelipeds and ambulatory legs are essentially as in A. Agassizii. 



PKOCEEDIXGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 5 

The number and arrangement of the dorsal spines of the carapax 
appear to be nearly as in A. hystrix Stinipson, as figured by A. Milne- 
Edwards (Crust, Kegion Mexicaine, p. 134, pi, 28, fig. 1, 1878), except 
tbat the lateral spines of the gastric region are obsolete in A. Tanneri; 
but all the spines are very greatly longer in hystrix, which appears to be 
a very distinct species.

Hyas coarctatus Leach. 

Taken at a number of stations off Martha's Vineyard, in 8G to 158 
fathoms, and also in much shallower water near Block Island and off 
No Man's Land. Four male specimens were taken off Chesapeake Bay 
in 1880, station 900, N. hit, 37° 19', W. long. 74° 41', 31 fath., sand— 
the farthest south the species has been noticed. 

Collodes robustus, sp. nov. 

Collodes depressus Smith, Proc. National Mus., iii, p. 414, 1681 (non A. M.- 
Edwards. ) 
A careful examination of one of the type specimens of C. depressus 
convinces me that the specimens which I have referred to that species 



6 PEOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

are really a distinct but closely allied and much larger species. Very 
small specimens, 10 m ™ or less in length of carapax, resemble the depresses 
very much, but arc distinguished from Milne-Edwards'* figures and the 
type specimen referred to by the less regularly triangular outline of the 
carapax, the hepatic and branchial regions being much more protuber- 
ant ; by the acute rostral horns, more widely separated at their tips ; by 
the much longer interantennular spine, which is fully as long as in Eu- 
prognatha rastellifera ; by the short and conical or even tuberculiform 
gastric and cardiac spines ; by the spine of the first somite of the abdo- 
men being directed backward instead of upward ; and by the more slender 
choice. 

Male. — In large males over 20 ram in length of carapax, the carapax 
is a little over three-fourths as broad as long, and thickly covered, as 
well as nearly all other parts of the animal except the chela?, with 
strongly curved hairs or seta 1 , which, in every specimen seen, persist- 
ant^ retain a thick coating of soft mud. The rostral horns are slender 
and separated by a rounded sinus, at the bottom of which the inter- 
antennular spine, or true rostrum, which is much longer than the rostral 
horns and grooved longitudinally in front, projects downward and about 
as far forward as the rostral horns. The basal segment of the antenna is 
armed with a lateral and an inferior ridge, each divided into three to five 
short spiniform teeth. The postorbital processes are broad, but acutely 
triangular, and project as far as the tips of the eyes. The dorsal sur- 
face is thickly covered with granular tubercles, and there is a slight 
tubercular elevation, but little more prominent than the tubercles of 
the general surface, on the gastric region, and another on the cardiac, 
in place of the spines in the young. The hepatic regiou is divided 
obliquely near the middle by a deep sulcus into two lobes, of which the 
superior projects in a rounded prominence, which is very conspicuous 
as seen from above, while the inferior is crossed longitudinally by the 
pleurotergal suture and below it armed with a short series of small tuber- 
culiform spines. The branchial regions are prominent, swollen, and 
evenly tuberculated. 

The chelipeds are stout and approximately once and a half as long 
as the carapax; the merus is triquetral with the angles armed more or 
less with tubercles or tuberculiform spines; the whole outer surface of 
the carpus is similarly armed. The chela is approximately two-thirds 
as long as the carapax, naked, smooth, polished, and unarmed, except a 
very few tubercles on the inner surface and near the proximal ends of 
the upper and under edges; the body is nearly as long as the digits, 
thick and swollen; and the digits are compressed, somewhat grooved 
longitudinally, very slightly curved, gaping at the bases, and with the 
prehensile edges slightly and irregularly crenate. The ambulatory legs 
arc hairy to very near the tips, but are otherwise unarmed and smooth 
throughout, and all the segments are subcylmdrical ; the first are about 
two and a half times as long as the carapax, the others successively 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 7 

shorter, and the last considerably less than twice as long as the cara- 
]>ax ; the dactyli are considerably curved, slender, and tapered near 
the acute chitinous tips. 

The sternum is tuberculose, like the dorsal surface of the carapax, 
except upon the concave portion between the bases of the chelipeds, 
where it is smooth. 

The first somite of the abdomen is tuberculose, like the carapax, and 
armed with a low tuberculiform prominence, in place of the spine in the 
young - . The second somite is very short and scarcely wider than the 
first. The third is widest of all, and from it the abdomen is regularly 
narrowed to the seventh somite, which is anchylosed with the sixth, as 
in Euprognatha rastcllifera, triangular, with the ti^> obtuse, and nearly 
as broad as long. 

Female. — The females appear not to attain the adult sexual char- 
acters until the carapax is about 12 mm in length, apparently never 
attain as great size as the males, and as usual resemble the young, 
although they lose the gastric, cardiac, and abdominal spines fully as 
early as the males. The carapax is slightly more convex and the bran- 
chial regions somewhat less swollen than in the male. The chelipeds 
remain small and weak, the chehe slender as in the young, and the am- 
bulatory legs proportionally shorter than in the male. 

The proportions of the carapax, chelipeds, and ambulatory legs in the 
young and adults of both sexes are well shown by the accompanying 
table of measurements. 

Measurements in millimeters and hundredths of length of carapax.

Neither Stimpson nor Milne-Edwards mentions the presence of an in-

speak of it in Euprognatha as specially distinguishing that genus from 
its near allies ; but in the two species which I have examined the spine 
is well developed, though less prominent, and not projecting forward 
at all in C. depressus.

Among the vast number of specimens examined there are very few 
sexually immature individuals. Both sexes ordinarily attain maturity be- 
fore the carapax is G mi " in length, and the scarcity of immature speci- 
mens in the collections may be due to their small size causing them 
to be overlooked in the great mass of material brought up in the trawl. 
The largest females seen do not exceed 10 mm in length of carapax, 
and differ very little from the smallest in the form and proportions 
of chelipeds and ambulatory legs, though the carapax is a little broader 
in proportion and the spines with which it is armed are much lower, or 
reduced to tubercles, in the larger specimens. The males attain much 
greater size than the females, the carapax often exceeding 14 nun in 
length, and there is a very marked and constant increase in the size 
of the chelipeds, particularly in the height and the thickness of the 
body of the chelae, well shown in the accompanying table of measure- 
ments. In both sexes there is considerable variation in the length of 
the spines of the carapax, even in specimens of the same size, and there 
is a marked decrease in the length of the spines with the growth of the 
individual. In large specimens the spines upon the orbital arches, upon 
the gastric, cardiac, and the summits of the branchial regions, and 
upon the basal segment of the abdomen, are usually reduced to low, 
and often inconspicuous, tubercles. 

The number and arrangement of the branchiae and epipods are indi- 
cated in the following formula :

* Immature specimens ; the others all adult, the females with eggs, even in the case of the smallest. 
The first and fourth ambulatory legs in the immature female are apparently reproduced appendages, 
which may. perhaps, account for the retardation in the sexual development of the individual. 

The specimens in the Fish Commission collections and in the Blake 
collection of 1880 appear to agree much more closely with those origi- 
nally described by Stimpson and those figured and described by Milne- 
Edwards than they do with a few Caribbean specimens which I have 
examined and which were labeled by Milne-Edwards as this species and 
returned to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. These specimens, 
two males and five females, are irom the Blake collection of 1878-79, 
station 134, off Santa *Cruz, 248 fathoms, and, though fully adult, are 
all very much smaller than any other adult specimens examined. They 
are also considerably smaller than the specimens described by Stimpson 
or Milne-Edwards. The carapax is slightly narrower than in the north- 
ern specimens, with the tubercles of the surface larger and all the spines 
longer and more slender ; the postorbital process is slender and spini- 
form instead of dentiform ; there is a small conical spine, much more 
acute and more prominent than in the northern specimens, on the eye, 
at the emargination of the cornea; and the ambulatory legs are more 
slender and armed with small spiniform tubercles which are much more 
conspicuous than in the northern specimens. In the males the chelae 
are proportionally larger, with the bodies stouter and more swollen; 
and in both sexes the chela? and other parts of the chelipeds are armed 
with larger and more scattered tubercles, many of which, especially on 
the carpus and merus, become spiniform and conspicuous. Some of 
these differences are well shown in the following measurements (in mil-

These Caribbean specimens are apparently specifically distinct, but 
a series of specimens from different parts of the West Indian region 
would perhaps show them to be a geographical or local variety. 

Lispognathus furcatus A. M. -Edwards. 

Lispognathus furcatus A. M. -Edwards, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, 
vii, p. 9, 1880. 

f Lispognathus furcillatus A. M. -Edwards, Rapport sur la Faune sous-marine 
dans les graudes profondeurs de la Me'diterrane'e et de l'Oce'an Atlantique 
(Arch. Missions Sci. et Littdraires, ix), pp. 16, 39, 1882 (no description). 

To this species I refer, with considerable hesitation, two specimens 
dredged off Martha's Vineyard : Station 951, N. lat. 39° 57', W. long. 70° 
31' 30", 225 fath., mud, Aug. 23, 1881 (male); station 109G, N. lat, 39° 
53', W. long. G9° 47', 317 fath., soft green mud, Aug. 11, 1882 (female 
carrying eggs). 

The carapax, excluding the rostral and lateral spines, is about four- 
fifths as broad as long in the male, and slightly broader and much thicker 
and more swollen in the female. The rostral horns are acicular, very 
slightly divergent, and slightly ascending, and in the male nearly three- 
tenths as long as the rest of the carapax. The three erect gastric and 
the postorbital spines are subequal and verj- slender and acute, and the 
postorbital spine each side is situated slightly in front of a line from the 
middle to the lateral gastric. The cardiac spine is considerably stouter 
and a little higher than the gastric spines, and either side of it on the 
dorsal part of the branchial region there is a much smaller erect spine, 
and on a line between this and the lateral gastric there is a similar spine 
in the female, but only a minute spine or tubercle in the male. There 
are two or three minute spines or tubercles on the protuberant superior 
lobe of the hepatic region, and about as many more back of these 
on the side of the brauchial region, while on the inferior hepatic lobe, 
opposite the middle of the buccal area, there is a much larger spine 
directed downward, and back of this a smaller one, near the base of the 
cheliped. The supraorbital spine is slender and about as long as the 
gastric spines, and in the male the iuterantennular is fully as long, 
stouter, and directed downward and curved slightly forward. The basal 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 13 

segment of the antenna is irregularly armed beneath with small spines 
or teeth, and in the male with a slender spine at the distal* end. The 
eyestalk is armed with a minute spine or tubercle in front, and above 
with a small tubercle at the emargination of the cornea. The exposed 
surface of the ischium and inerus of the external maxillipeds is armed 
conspicuously with marginal and submarginal spines, of which one on 
the inner edge of the merus is very long. 

The chelipeds in the male are stout and nearly twice as long as the 
carapax, including the rostral horns ; the merus is a little shorter than 
the chela and triquetral, with all three of the angles thickly armed with 
very long and slender spines; the carpus is rounded externally, but 
armed like the merus; the chela is longer than the carapax, excluding 
the rostral horns, and naked and unarmed except by a few spines along 
the proximal part of the dorsal edge; the body is stout and swollen, 
and the digits slightly shorter than the body, nearly straight vertically 
but strongly curved laterally, very much compressed, grooved longitu- 
dinally on the sides and on the rather broad dorsal edge of the dactylus, 
and the prehensile edges crenately serrate and in contact throughout. 
In the female the chelipeds are only about once and a half as long as 
the carapax, including the rostral spines, much more slender than in the 
male, and armed with proportionally longer spines ; and the chela is 
much shorter than the carapax, excluding the rostral horns; the body is 
scarcely at all swollen, and is armed with slender spines along both 
edges and with minute spines or tubercles on the sides, and the digits 
are proportionally longer and narrower than in the male. 

The ambulatory legs are very long and slender, clothed to the tips of 
the dactyli with numerous curved setiform hairs which persistently re- 
tain mud and other foreign substances, and each is armed with a slender 
spine on the upper side of the distal end of the merus. 

In the male the abdomen is much broader relatively to the sternum 
than in Euprognatha rastellifera, and has a low tuberculiform elevation 
on each somite. The first and second somites are narrow, the third 
broadest of all, the fourth and fifth successively a very little narrower, 
the fifth fully twice as broad as long, and the sixth and seventh consol- 
idated as in Euprognatha and CoUodeSj together much broader than long 
and very broad and obtuse at the tip. The appendages of the first 
somite reach nearly to the tip of the abdomen, and their tips are stout 
and curved outward very strongly. 

The eggs are numerous, nearly spherical, and approximately 0.6 mm in 
diameter in alcoholic specimens.

The specimens taken in 1881 are much smaller than the type speci- 
mens taken in 1880 ; none of the females are fully adult, and the largest 
males, though adult, are apparently not fully grown. The largest of 
tbe males differ very little from the females originally described, except 
that the chelipeds are proportionally a little larger. In the smaller 
specimens of both sexes there are rather fewer small tubercles upon the 
carapax, and the teeth of the lateral margins of the carapax and angles 
of the chelipeds are, perhaps, smaller and less lacineated proportionally, 
but the differences are very slight, and there is no approach to L. Pour- 
taJcsii as figured by A. Milne-Edwards. The accompanying table of 
measurements shows the slight variations in the proportions of the cara- 
pax and chelipeds better than description. In some specimens the 
chelipeds are slightly unequal, but in none conspicuously so, and when 
the difference was noticeable in the specimens measured the measure- 
ments of xhe cheliped were made from the larger one. 

CANCROIDA. 
Cancer borealis Stimpson. 

Taken off Martha's Vineyard, in 18S0, 1881, and 1S82, at a great num- 
ber of the stations, in 51 to 317 fathoms, and also in shallow water ; off 
Delaware Bay, 1SS1, stations 1017 and 1049, 156 and 435 fathoms; and 
off Chesapeake Bay, 1880, stations 896, 897, 899, and 901, 18 to 157 
fathoms. Most of the deep-water specimens taken by the Fish Com- 
mission are small, but much larger specimens, among them several from 
100 to 130 millimeters in breadth of carapax, were taken in 1880, by 
Alexander Agassiz, on the Blake, off the Carolina coast, in 142 to 233 
fathoms. The largest of these specimens were from Blake station 314; 
N. lat. 32° 24', X. long. 78° 44', 142 fathoms. 

Cancer irroratus has not been taken in any of the deeper dredgings 
off Martha's Vineyard, although it is a common littoral and shallow- 
water species on the whole !New England coast, and was taken by Alex- 
ander Agassiz at several stations, in 65 to 178 fathoms, off the Carolina 
coast, even occurring with G. borealis at station 314, just mentioned.

This species grows to be by far the largest brachyuran in our waters. 
The largest specimen which I have seen is from the Blake collection of 
1S80, and was taken off Cape Hatteras. This specimen, measurements of 
the carapax of which are given in the last line of the following table of 
measurements, is more than six inches across the carapax and two feet 
across the outstretched legs. Very large individuals differ considerably 
from the specimens originally described. In all the large specimens the 
teeth of the anterolateral margin of the carapax become reduced to an- 
gular tubercles, and in some of the larger ones the fourth tooth becomes 
entirely obsolete. Specimens of the same size vary much, particularly the 
larger ones, in the prominence of the anterolateral teeth, so that the pro- 
pertional breadth of the carapax, including the teeth or spines, varies 
much more than the breadth excluding the teeth or spines, as shown 
in the table of measurements. This variation is partially due to the 
wearing away of the teeth, which probably takes place rapidly on 
account of the softness of the exoskeletou, which is much less calcareous 
than usual, the branchial regions of the carapax being so soft as to be 
readily bent or indented with the finger.

Stimpson's B. longispina was based on very young males, the length 
of carapax in his measurement of a siugle specimen beiug equal to 
14.5 mm , and the B. brevispina on a very large female in which the 
carapax was 49 mm in length. A. Milne-Edwards's specimens were evi- 
dently small, although he apparently translates the measurements 
given by Stimpson and does not indicate the exact size of the speci- 
men figured. In the series of specimens which I have examined the 
largest are connected with the smallest by a complete series, and 
though none of the specimens are as large as the type of Stimpson's 
brevispina, the larger ones, both male and female, approach it closely 
enough in the length of the lateral spines of the carapax, etc., to make 
it clear that the forms described by Stimpson belong to the same species. 
The accompanying table of measurements will show this quite as well 
as any description. 

In specimens shortly after being placed in alcohol, and before the 
colors had changed materially from those in life, the dorsum of the cara- 
pax was dull red, the color being almost wholly upon the tubercles and 
granules, while the ground between was grayish, though the spines and 
teeth of the margin were brighter red than the general surface from a 
slight deposit of color between the tubercles and granules. The ven- 
tral surface of the carapax, the antennuhe, antenna?, external maxillipeds, 
sternum, abdomen, and the proximal portions of the ambulatory legs 
were pale red or tinged with red. The chelipeds were specked and 
slightly mottled with red; the terminal third of the digits scarlet, some 
what obscured at the tips by blackish. The meral and carpal segments 
of the first three pairs of ambulatory legs, and the meral, carpal, and 
propodal segments of the posterior pair were specked and mottled with 
scarlet; the propodal segments of the first three pairs, except a narrow 
band at the distal end, and the whole of the dactyli of all four pairs 
were bright scarlet.

OXYSTOMATA. 

Acanthocarpus Alexandra Stimpson. 

Although this species occurred in considerable abundance in the 
dredgings off Martha's Vineyard in 1SS0, being taken at seven out of the 
fourteen stations in between 50 and 200 fathoms, it was taken but once 
in 1881, station 944, 128 fathoms, and was not taken at all in 1882. 

In the living specimens taken iu 1881 the dorsal surface of the carapax 
and chelipeds was pale reddish orange, deepest in color upon the eleva- 
tions of the carapax and upon the bases of the carpal spines of the 
chelipeds; while the carapax beneath, the sternum, abdomen, and the 
uuder surfaces of the chelipeds and ambulatory legs were white, very 
slightly tinged with reddish.

Cymopolia gracilis, sp. nov. 

This species, of which only one specimen has been obtained, resembles 
C. cursor, A. Milne-Edwards (Bull. Mns. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, viii, p. 
29, 18S0), in the great length of the second pair of ambulatory legs, but 
is at once distinguished by the much smoother carapax without tubercles 
on the posterior margin, by the broad sinuses of the superior margin of 
the orbit, and by the conspicuously hook-shaped tips of the first pair of 
abdominal appendages of the male. 

Male. — The front is deeply divided by a sharp median sinus, and is 
slightly and obtusely bilobed either side, with the inner lobes much more 
prominent than the lateral. The orbit is very broad and open above. 
The superior margin is armed with two small teeth, separated from each 
other and from the inner and outer angles of the orbit by rounded 
sinuses, of which the inner is very broad and nearly semicircular 5 the 
middle and outer successively smaller; the outer angle is triangular 
and a little less prominent than the outer suborbital lobe, which is 
dentiform and separated from it by a shallow sinus; and the inner sub- 
orbital process (which is also the dorsal wall of the efferent branchial 
passage) is narrow, rounded at the tip, reaches nearly as far forward as 
the lobes of the front, and is separated from the outer suborbital lobe 
by a very broad and rounded sinus. The antero-lateral margin is un- 
armed, except by a small dentiform tubercle on the anterior part of the 
branchial region in place of the sharp tooth in C. cursor. The dorsal 
surface of the carapax is naked, minutely granulated, and armed with 
a very few low and obtuse tubercles. There are three faintly indicated 
tubercles on the middle of the gastric region ; two, the largest of all, 
surmount a transverse ridge on the anterior part of the cardiac region ; 
on either side, and nearly in line with these, are two smaller ones on 
the branchial region, above and back of the dentiform marginal tubercle 
already referred to ; and in front of these two small ones there is a slight 
but scarcely tuberculiform elevation. 

The eyes are large, the greatest diameter equaling nearly a third the 
length of the carapax, reniform, and bear upon the upper side of the 
stalk, near the cornea, two or three minute elevations, which are much 
less conspicuous than the tubercles similarly situated in C. cursor. 

The chelipeds are slightly longer than the breadth of the carapax, 
and the chelrc are slender, naked, and nearly smooth, and the long, 
compressed, and very slender digits hooked at the tips and serrate 
along the prehensile edges. The first ambulatory leg is nearly twice 
as long as the breadth of the carapax, very slender, naked, and nearly 
smooth, except a very few minute granular tubercles near the base of 
the merus, and the dactylus is nearly as long as the propodus, sub- 
cylindrical, regularly tapered and slightly curved. The second ambu- 
latory leg is apparently more than twice as long as the first ; the merus 
reaches nearly to the tip of the first leg, is tapered distally, and is 
armed with a few minute teeth near the distal end of the posterior edge

and along the anterior and dorsal surface with small granular tubercles 
which become obsolete distally, are much less conspicuous than in 
C. cursor, and not definitely arranged in several longitudinal lines as 
in that species 5 the carpus is about two-fifths as long as the nierus, 
slender and unarmed; the dactylus and the distal part of the propodus 
are wautiug. The third ambulatory leg is a little longer than the first, 
fully as slender, and very much like it in lack of ornamentation and in 
the proportions of the segments. The posterior ambulatory legs are 
shorter than the merus in the third, and very slender. 

The abdomen is unarmed externally. The first pair of appendages 
reach to the second sternal somite, and the distal part of each appendage 
is straight to near the tip, which is curved outward and backward in a 
semicircular, blunt-pointed hook, and armed on the outer edge at the 
base of the hook with a conspicuous tooth.

In C. cursor the teeth of the superior margin of the orbit are much 
larger than in gracilis and the sinuses smaller and more triangular. The 
anterior-lateral margin projects in a dentiform tubercle on the hepatic 
region, and back of this on the anterior part of the branchial region 
there is an acute and prominent tooth directed somewhat forward, and 
a smaller but acute tooth, just back of its base.* The first pair of 

* There is evident confusion in regard to the armament of the anterolateral margin 
in Milne-Edwards's description above referred to, for he says, " Lc bord lateral ne porte 
pasdes dents, en avantdu sillon post-hepatique les regions branchialcs sont pourvues 
des quelques gros tubercnles sur lenr bord." I have examined four of the original 
specimens of C. cursor returned to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and they all 
have the antero-lateral margin armed, as here described, but agree in all other re- 
spects with Milne-Edwards's brief description.

abdominal appendages of the male are fully as long as in gracilis, but 
the tips are slender and styliforin instead of hooked. 

Ethusa microphthalma Smith, Proc. National Mns., iii, p. 418, 1881. 

Station 921, off Martha's Vineyard, K lat. 40° 7' 48", W. long. 70° 43' 
54", G7 fath. (15,1$); station 1047, off Delaware Bay, K lat. 38° 31', 
W. long. 73° 21', 15G fath. (1 6" ). The original specimen was from 
station 878, off Martha's Vineyard, N. lat. 39° 55', W. long. 70° 54' 15", 
142 fath. 

The female from station 921 is fully adult, but does not differ essen- 
tially from the immature female from which the species was originally 
described; in this fully adult specimen the anterolateral angles of the 
carapax, however, project farther forward, reaching a little beyond the 
spines of the front, and the ambulatory legs are apparently propor- 
tionally longer and have proportionally slightly longer and narrower 
dactyli. 

The two males differ very remarkably from one another, and are pos- 
sibly distinct species. The one from station 921 is only slightly larger 
than the immature female (from station 878) and differs very little from 
it in the proportions of the carapax, the form of the front, or in the eyes, 
external oral appendages, or ambulatory legs, except that the first and 
second pairs are proportionally longer, with slightly longer and narrower 
dactyli. The chelipeds, however, are very unequal. The left is slender 
throughout, and like those of the female, while the right, though very 
little longer than the left, has a very stout and swollen chela. The 
right merus is much like the left, but considerably stouter; the carpus is 
much stouter than the left, and considerably swollen; and the chela is more 
than twice as thick as the left, smooth and naked throughout, the body 
longer than the digits and much swollen, and the digits tapered to the 
tip, the prehensile edges somewhat oblique and unarmed. The male 
from station 1047, though of about the same size as the other, has a 
narrower carapax, distinctly longer than broad, but with the front abso- 
lutely broader; the ambulatory legs are considerably shorter, and with 
slightly broader dactyli; and the chelipeds are equal, and like the left 
one of the other male, except that they are very slightly shorter, and 
with proportionally slightly shorter chelse.

Lithodes Agassizii Smith, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, x, p. 8, pi. 1, 1882. 

Two very small, immature specimens of this interesting species were 
taken off Martha's Vineyard in 1881, station 1028, N. lat. 39° 57', W. 
long. G9° 17', 410 fath., yellow mud ; and station 1029, N. lat. 39° 57' 
6", W. long. 09° 16', 458 fath., yellow mud. Another immature speci- 
men and two adult females were taken by Alexander Agassiz on the 
Blake, in 1880 ; the immature specimen at station 305, N. lat. 41° 33'

15", W. long. 65° 51' 25", 810 fathoms ; the two females off the Carolina 
coast, stations 326 and 329, 464 and 603 fath. 

The species is allied to L. maid and L. antarctica in having no scale 
and only a single spine at the base of the antenna, and in the general 
form and armament of the carapax and appendages, but differs from 
them both conspicuously in the rostrum, which is rather short and tri- 
spiuous, with the lateral spines nearly as long as the rostral spine itself. 
The spines upon the carapax and appendages are more numerous and 
much more acute than in L. maia, and the marginal spines of the cara- 
pax are not very much larger than the dorsal. The two adults differ 
remarkably from each other, and from the immature specimens, in 
the number and length of the spines upon the carapax and legs, the 
spines being fewer and very much longer and more slender in the small 
specimens than in the adults, and more slender and more numerous in 
the smaller than in the larger of the two adult specimens. 

Four of the five specimens seen give the following measurements in 
millimeters :

PAGURIDEA. 

Eupagurus pubescena Brandt ex Kroyer. 

This species appears to be restricted to a very narrow region south 
of Cape Cod. It has not been taken in over 65 fathoms off Martha's 
Vineyard, though common in much deeper water north of Cape Cod. 
None of the specimens seen are large, and all the carcincecia are com- 
posed of Epizoanthus Americanus or entirely overgrown with it.

Eupagurus politus Smith. (PI. 4, fig. 4.) 

Eupagurv,8,sp., Smith, Proc. National Mus., iii, p. 428,1881. 

Eupagurus politus, Smith, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, x, p. 12, pi. 2, 

fig. 5, 1882. 

The carapax is not suddenly narrowed at the bases of the antennoe, 
where the breadth is equal to the length in front of the cervical suture, 
and not rostrated, the median lobe of the front being broadly rounded 
and not projecting as far forward as the external angles of the orbital 
sinuses, which are acute and each usually armed with a short spine. 

The eyestalks, including the eyes, are nearly four-fifths as long as 
the breadth of the carapax in front, stout, and expanded at the very 
large black eyes, which are terminal, not oblique, compressed vertically, 
and broader than half the length of the stalks. The ophthalmic scales 
are small, narrow, and spiniform at the tips. 

The peduncle of the anteunula is about as long as the breadth of the 
carapax in front, and the ultimate segment about a third longer than 
the penultimate. The upper flagellum is much longer than the ultimate 
segment of the peduncle, while the lower is only about half as long as 



28 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

the upper, slender, and composed of ten to twelve segments. The 
peduncle of the antenna reaches slightly beyond the eye. The acicle is 
slender, slightly curved, and reaches to the tip of the peduncle, and 
inside its base there is a minute tooth, while outside there is a straight 
spine toothed or spined along its inner edge, acute at the tip and half 
as long as the acicle itself. The flagellum is nearly naked, and about 
three times as long as the carapax. 

The exposed parts of the oral appendages are very nearly as in E. 
bernhardus. 

The chelipeds are longer, much narrower, and more nearly equal in 
size than in E. bernhardus, and, as in that species, are almost entirely 
naked, but beset with numerous tubercles and low spines. The right 
cheliped is about as long as the body from the front of the carapax to 
the tip of the abdomen. The inerus and carpus are subequal in length, 
while the chela is about once and a half as long as the carpus. The 
carpus and chela are rounded above and armed with numerous tuber- 
cles, which are smaller and more crowded on the chela than on the 
carpus, but the surface between the tubercles is smooth and polisbed. 
The dorsal surface of the carpus is limited along the inner edge by a 
sharp angle armed with a double line of tubercles, while the outer edge 
is rounded. The chela is very little wider than the carpus, and is nar- 
rowed from near the base to the tips of the digits, and both edges are 
rounded. The digits are rather slender, about half as long as the entire 
chela, slightly gaping, with acute and strongly incurved chitinous tips, 
and the prehensile edges armed with a very few obtuse tuberculiform 
teeth. The left chela is much more slender than the right, but reaches 
to or a little by the base of its dactylus. The carpus is slender, higher 
than broad, only slightly expanded distally, and with the narrow dorsal 
surface flattened, naked, nearly smooth, and margined either side with 
a single line of spiniform tubercles, while the rest of the surface is beset 
with low, squamiform, setiferous tubercles. The chela is about a third 
longer than the carpus, slender, about two and a half times as long as 
broad, and the dactylus about two-thirds the entire length. The dorsal 
and outer surface is tuberculose, and a low obtuse ridge extends from 
near the middle of the base along the propodal digit, which tapers from 
the base to the tip, while the dactylus is nearly or quite smooth except 
for a few fascicles of setoe, more slender than the propodal digit, ami 
tapered only near the tip. The chitinous tips of the digits are slender, 
acute, and strongly incurved, and the prehensile edges are sharp, and 
armed with a closely set series of slender spines or seta?. 

The ambulatory legs reach considerably beyond the right cheliped, 
and the second pair reach to the tips of the first pair. In both pairs 
the meri and propodi are approximately equal in length and longer than 
the carpi, while the dactyli are about once and a half as long as the pro- 
podi, slender, strongly curved, and distally strongly twisted. The two

posterior pairs of thoracic legs and the abdominal appendages are very 
nearly as in E. bcrnhardus. 

In life the general color of the exposed parts is pale orange, the tips 
of the chelae and of the ambulatory legs white, the eyes black. 

The eggs are very large, and few in number as compared with the 
ordinary species of the genus, being 1.0 mm to l.l mm in diameter in alco- 
holic specimens, while in E. bemhardus they are only 0.45 mm to 0.50 mm 
in diameter.

The females apparently never attain as large size as the males, but 
they do not seem to differ from them in the relative proportions of any 
of the cephalo thoracic appendages. 

The accompanying list of specimens examined shows that this is one 
of the most uniformly distributed and abundant species in from 50 to 
400 fathoms from Cape Cod to the Carolina coast. I have already ex- 
amined specimens from more than three-quarters of the whole number 
of dredgings made by the Fish Commission during the past three years 
within this region and between these depths.

cies returned to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and find it iden- 
tical with my species as indicated above. This specimen is from 200 
fathoms, off Barbadoes, station 296, and gives the following measure- 
ments in millimeters :

The large number of specimens which have been obtained since this 
species was first described enables me to supplement to a considerable 
extent the original description, drawn from a single specimen from which 
the oral appendages were not removed. 

The labrum, inetastoine, mandibles, and the first maxilla are essentially 
as in Eupagurus bernhardus. The lobes of the protognath of the second 
maxilla are very nearly as in Eupagurus bernhardus ; the endognath is a 
little longer than in that species, reaching nearly as far forward as the dis- 
tal lobe of the protopod ; the scaphognath is very different from that of 
Eupagurus bernhardus, the anterior part being very much larger and nar- 
rowed to a triangular tip reaching much beyond the middle of the endog- 
nath, while the posterior part is elongated, somewhat ovate in outline, 
about two-thirds as long as the anterior, and very little more than half as 
broad as long. The lobes of the protopod and the endopod of the first 
maxilliped are nearly as in Eupagurus bernhardus except that the endo- 
pod is united with ,the exopod for a considerable distance from the 
base; the endopod itself, however, is very different, being a simple, un- 
segmented lamella, shorter than the endopod, broad and truncated at 
the extremity and setigerous along the outer and terminal edges. Just 
back of the base of the exopod the edge of the protopod is setigerous 
and projects laterally in a slight prominence apparently representing the 
epipod. The second and third (external) maxillipeds are essentially as 
in Eupagurus bernhardus.

The branchiae are the same in number and arranged in the same way

But, as stated in the original description, they are trichobranehia>, not 
phyllobranchisc as in ordinary Paguroids. In the original specimen, 
and in all those not preserved with special care, the branchiae are flaccid 
and the papillae of which they are composed are collapsed, apparently 
cylindrical throughout, and without definite arrangement along the stem 
of the branchia ; but in specimens carefully preserved in strong alcohol 
the papillae in the thicker parts of the branchiae are seen to be slightly 
flattened toward their bases in the direction of the axes of the branchiae, 
and to have a definite arrangement in four longitudinal series, showing, 
in a transverse section of the branchia, two papillae either side of the 
central axis in place of the thin lamella attached by one edge to either 
side of the lamelliform central stem of the phyllobranchia of ordinary 
Paguroids. Toward the tips of the branchiae the papillae become truly 
cylindrical as inHomarus or Astacns, and in some of the smaller branchiae, 
as in the arthrobranchiae of the external maxillipeds, the papillae upon 
one side of the branchia are very small or rudimentary ; but in all cases 
the ultimate divisions of the branchiae are apparently strictly tricho- 
branchial in structure, the blood vessels on either side of each papilla 
giving off capillary branches in opposite directions to the surface of the 
papilla. The structure is essentially as in Astacus, and the difference 
is not apparent without close examination. From ordinary Paguroids, 
like Eupagurus bernhardus, however, it is widely different, but this dif- 
ference is partially bridged by the structure of the branchia} in Sympa- 
gurus pictus about to be described, although there the branchiae are es- 
sentially phyllobranchia?. 

In the chelipeds the ineras, carpus, and chela are very densely clothed, 
except at the tips of the digits, a space on the under side and at the base 
of the chela, and the inner side of the merus, with a very fine and soft 
pubescence usually loaded with fine mud when the specimens are first 
taken. 

Individuals differ considerably in the form and proportions of the cheli- 
peds. In one large male, measurements of which are given in the last 
column in the accompanying table of measurements, the right cheliped 
is only very slightly longer and scarcely stouter than the left, and the 
chela differs from that of the left only slightly in form. The defective 
development of the right cheliped in this specimen probably resulted 



36 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



from the loss and reproduction of the limb, but in other specimens there 
are considerable differences in the form of the right chela -which are 
apparently not the result of loss and reproduction, though it may be 
possible that all the cases of considerable variation in the form of the 
chela? are due to this cause. The right chela is, in both sexes, usually 
very broad, half or more than half as broad as long, but in some speci- 
mens, as shown in the second column of the table of measurements, it 
is much narrower, only about three-eighths as broad as long. 

The appendages of the second abdominal somite of the male are fre- 
quently very distinctly unequal in size, the right being longer than the 
left, but in many specimens they are exactly alike. The appendages ot 
the first somite are apparently perfectly symmetrical in all the speci- 
mens examined. 

The females appear to be a little smaller than the males, but appar- 
ently do not differ in the form or proportions of any of the cephalo- 
thoracic appendages. There are four well-developed biramus append- 
ages on the left side of the abdomen as in the species of Eupagunts, and 
the third, fourth, and fifth somites are each furnished with a diffuse 
dorsal tuft of long hairs. The eggs are nearly spherical and larger 
than in Eupagurus bernhardns, being nearly a millimeter in diameter in 
alcoholic specimens. 

In life the general color of the naked and exposed parts is pale, dull 
orange, darker at the tips of the ambulatory legs, without any of the 
conspicuous red markings characteristic of Sympagurus pictus. 

All of the carcincecia seen are formed by colonies of Epizoanthus 
paguriphilus Verrill, which at first invest spiral shells which are finally 
absorbed by the basal ccenenchyma of the growing polyps. In some 
of the very small specimens the investing walls of the polyp are so thin 
that the form and markings of the inclosed shell are distinctly visible 
through them, but in all the larger specimens the shell is completely 
absorbed.

Sympagunis, gen. nov. 

The single species of the genus here proposed is readily distinguished 
from Parapaguru8 by the shortness of the peduncles of the antennulse 
and the well developed eyes, iu which respects it agrees essentially with 
Eupagurus. It differs essentially from Parapagurus in having phyllo- 
branchia?, which are the same in number and arranged in the same way as 
in Parapagurus and Eupagurus, but differ much from the branchia? of 
Eupagurus and the ordinary Paguroids in having the lamellae long, nar- 
row, attached by one end to the narrow stem of the branchia and arranged 
in two loosely packed longitudinal series either side of the axis of the 
branchia. At tbe extremity of the branchia?, however, the lamella? 
become very narrow, and at the extreme tips apparently papilliform as 
at the tips of the branchia? of Parapagurus. The oral, thoracic, and 
abdominal appendages are essentially as in Parapagurus, the sexual 
appendages of the first and second somites of the abdomen of the male 
are, however, much smaller and less perfectly developed. 

Sympagurus pictus, sp. nov. (PI. 5, Figs. 2,2a; PI. 6, Figs. 5-8.) 

The carapax is divided by a deep, cervical suture, which is arcuate 
as in Parapagurus pilo.simanus, but is narrowed anteriorly much more 
than in that species, the breadth at the buses of the antennae scarcely 
equaling the length in front of the cervical suture. The anterior margin 
projects in a prominent triangular rostrum with a distinct longitudinal 
carina, and either side is considerably oblique, with only a slight 
prominence between the base of the eyestalk and the peduncle of the 
antenna. 

The eyestalks, including the eyes, are about two-fifths as long as the 
carapax along the dorsal line, stout, and expanded at the very large 
black eyes, which are terminal, not oblique, compressed vertically, and 
from two-fifths to nearly a half as broad as the length of the stalks. 
The ophthalmic scales are small, spiniform, and acute as in Parapagur us 
pilosimanus. 

The peduncle of the antennula is a little longer than the breadth of tbe 
carapax in front, the second segment reaches to the tip of the eye, and 
the ultimate segment is about half the entire length. The upper fiag- 
ellum is about as long as the ultimate segment of the peduncle, while 
the lower is only about half as long, slender, and composed of seven or 
eight segments. The peduncle of the antenna reaches slightly by the 
eye and the ultimate segment is nearly twice as long as the penultimate. 
The acicle is slender, sparsely setigerous, and reaches to the tip of the 
peduncle, and outside its base there is a dentiform process, but no 
tooth or spine inside. The flagellum is nearly naked and about four 
times as long as the carapax. 

The oral appendages are all nearly as in Parapagurus pilosimanus, 
except that, in the second maxilla, the endognath is broader at the 
base, the anterior lobe of the scaphognath is shorter and broader, 
though still triangular at the tip, and the posterior lobe is shorter,

broader, and approximately triangular; "while, in the first maxilliped, 
the endopod and exopod are a little shorter and the latter rounded at 
the extremity. 

The chelipeds are densely pubescent, as in Parapagurus pilosimanus, 
and resemble those of that species closely until the pubescence is re- 
moved, when they are seen to be different in form and armament. The 
right cheliped in fully grown specimens is about three times as long as 
the carapax along the dorsal line. The carpus is slightly longer than 
the merus, obscurly angulated along the inner dorsal edge, and the 
dorsal surface covered with small tubercles which are acute and almost 
spiniform along the inner edge. The chela is at least once and two- 
thirds as long as the carpus, much less than half as broad as long, com- 
pressed vertically, convex, and only slightly tuberculous above and 
below, but armed along the edges with sharp tubercles, -which are most 
conspicuous along the inner edge and particularly on the dactylus, where 
they become spiniform. The digits are longitudinal, not turned to the 
right as in Parapagurus pilosimanus, about as long as the body of the 
chela, regularly tapered toward the strongly hooked tips, and the pre- 
hensile edges armed with irregular, low, and obtuse tubercles. The 
left cheliped is about two-thirds as long as the right, very slender, and 
clothed with pubescence like the right. The carpus is scarcely longer 
or stouter than the merus, and angulated and armed with a few sharp 
tubercles along the inner dorsal edge. The chela is about once and 
two-thirds as long as the carpus, scarcely stouter, rounded and unarmed, 
with the digits much longer than the body, slender, slightly curved 
downward at the tips, not gaping, and the prehensile edges sharp and 
armed with a closely set series of minute spines. 

The ambulatory legs reach to or a little by the right cheliped, are 
smooth and nearly naked, except near the tips, and unarmed, except a 
small dentiform tooth at the distal end of the dorsal edge of the carpus. 
The dactyli are longer than the propodi, slender, laterally compressed, 
strongly curved toward the acute tips, and setigerous along the dorsal 
edge and on the inner side. The fourth and fifth pairs of legs and the 
sterna of all the thoracic somites are as in Parapagurus pilosimanus. 

The appendages of the first and second abdominal somites of the 
male arise in the same way as in Parapagurus pilosimanus. The appen- 
dages of the first somite are like those of Parapagurus pilosimanus in 
form, but are very much smaller, being scarcely 3£ millimeters in length 
in the largest specimen examined, and project only a little way below 
the coxa? of the posterior thoracic legs. The appendages of the second 
somite are very unequally developed; the right is nearly as in Parapa- 
gurus pilosimanus in form, but is much smaller, being only 7 millimeters 
long in the largest male examined, and the terminal lamelliform seg- 
ment is a little broader in proportion, being about a fourth longer than 
the basal portion and a fourth as broad as long, and is apparently less 
deeply grooved ; while the left is very much smaller, only 4.8 millime-

ters lone in the specimen just referred to, and the terminal lamella smaller 
even than the basal portion, very narrow, and scarcely at all grooved. 

The appendages of the left side of the third, fourth, and fifth somites 
of the abdomen of the male, the four ovigerous appendages of the left 
side of the abdomen of the female, and the uropods in both .sexes, are 
as in Parapagurus pitosiman t<s and Eupagurus bernhardus. The telson is 
about as broad as long, but bilaterally unsynnnetrical, the left side being 
longer than the right, and the posterior margin oblique, with a slight 
anal emargination a little to the right of the center. 

The carciuoeciuin of the specimen from station 893 is formed by Epizo- 
anthus A»iC)icanusYern\\ 7 but the carcincecia of all the other specimens 
examined are formed by the base of a single polyp of Urticina consors 
Verrill (xVmer. Jour. Sci., Ill, xxiii, p. 225, 1882).

In the large male from station 924, the appendage of the right side 
of the second somite of the abdomen is 7 mm long, and its terminal lamella 
4 mm long and l mm broad ; while the appendage of the left side is 4.8 mm 
long, and its terminal lamella only 2.3 mm long and 0.5 mm broad. 

In life the front part of the carapax is orange red bordered with white 
along the margin. The eye-stalks and the peduncles of the attennulre 
and antennae are white, except the undersides of the eye-stalks, which are 
vermilion. The flagella of the antennuhe and antennas are pale orange. 
A large spot of vermilion covers nearly the whole of the outer surface 
and extends over upon the inferior edge of the meri of the ambulatory 
legs, and the inferior edges of the carpi and propodi and the tips of the 
dactyli are marked with the same color, while the rest of the surface is 
white. The posterior part of the carapax and the abdomen are trans- 
lucent whitish specked above with orange red, and the telson and uro- 
pods are similarly but more thickly specked with the same color. The 
eyes are black.

GALATHEIDEA. 

Munida Caribcea? Smith. (PI. 3, Fig. 11.) 

Munkla Caribceal Smith, Proc. National Mus., iii, p. 423, 1881. 

Munida, sp. indet. Smith, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, x, p. 22, pi. 10, 

fig. 1, 1882. 
? Munida Canbcea Stimpson, Ann. Lyceum Nat. Hist. New York, vii, p. 244 

(116), 1860. — A. M.-Echvards, Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambridge, viii, p. 41), 

1880 {Caribwa). 

In my preliminary notice of two years ago I referred this species 
doubtfully, as indicated above, to Stimpson's species described from a 
single very small specimen which is no longer extant. Almost simul- 
taneously Milne-Edwards published ten new species of the genus from 
the Blake dredgings in the Caribbean region, and referred specimens of 
still another to Stimpson's Caribcea, but without describing them at all. 
It seems best to restrict Stimpson's name to the species called Caribcea 
by Milne-Edwards, whatever that may be, but it is quite impossible to 
determine from Milne-Edwards's descriptions alone whether the species 
which I have called Caribcea belongs to either of the eleven species 
enumerated by him and, until it is possible to settle this point satisfac- 
torily, the species may be conveniently designated Munida Caribcea 1 ! 
Smith, as above. 

The species attains greater size than any of the specimens taken in 
1880, measurements of some of the largest of which were given in my 
preliminary notice of two years ago. The specimens from the same sta- 
tion are usually approximately alike in size, those from one station 
being nearly all small, while those from another, even near by and on 
the same day, are nearly all large. The largest specimens are from sta- 
tion 1043, off Delaware Bay, and six of these give the following meas- 
urements in millimeters :

The specimens from which the hist four columns of measurements 
were taken have the chelre modified, as usual in the old males of the 
species of the genus, by the proximal curvature and expansion of the 
digits, particularly the propodal, so as to leave them gaping at base ; 
while the specimen from which the second column of measurements was 
taken has the chela? slender and unmodified as in the female.

Muuida valida, sp. no v. (PL 1.) 

A large species with the general appearance of M. Bamffia, but at 
once distinguished from it, and from M. tcnuimana, and Caribcea f Smith 
as well, by the short and obtusely rounded epimera of all the abdominal 
somites. 

Excluding the rostrum, the carapax is about three-fourths as broad as 
long; including the rostrum, about four-sevenths as broad as long, the 
rostrum being more than a fourth the entire length. The rostrum and 
the spines at its base are shorter and stouter than the M. Bamffia, and 
the latter are about three-fifths as long as the rostrum, strongly diver- 
gent and directed somewhat upward, while the rostrum is horizontal. 
The number and position of the spines on the dorsal surface and along 
the lateral margins of the carapax are very nearly as in .1/. Bamffia, ex- 
cept that there are no spines along the raised posterior margin. The 
orbital part of the anterior margin is more oblique than in 21. Bamffia, 
and the antennal spine is not, as in that species, at the antero-lateral 
angle, but the margin between the antennal and hepatic spines is only 
a very little more oblique than the orbital margin, and the antero-lateral 
angle is really formed by the hepatic spine. The carapax is apparently 
wider and less convex than in M. Bamffia, the sutures of the dorsal sur- 
face are deeper, and the transverse rugse are apparently fewer and more 
conspicuous. 

The eyes are about as large as in M. Bamffia, but not so strongly com- 
pressed. 

The basal segment of the antennula is armed with a slender spine 
arising from the prominence on the outer margin and directed forward, 
a larger spine on the outer edge of the distal end, and between these 
two a long spine, two-thirds as long as the segment itself, directed 
obliquely upward, while at the distal end of the inner side there is only 
an inconspicuous dentiform spine in place of the very long and slender 
spine found there in M. Bamffia, tcnulmana, and Caribceaf Smith. The 
flagella of the antennae are subcylindrical, slender, nearly naked, and 
not far from twice as long as the entire length of the body. 

The merus of the external maxilliped is not distinctly tapered dis- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 43 

tally, and the ventral edge is armed with a slender spine at the distal 
end and a larger one a little way from the proximal end. 

The chelipeds are equal, and in the male about two and a half times 
as long as the carapax, and resemble those of M. Bamjfia very closely. 
In the male, the inerus is nearly as long as the carapax, the carpus 
about two-fifths as long as the merus, and the chela much longer than 
the merus, much more slender, with the digits fully three-fourths as long 
as the body, slender, straight, and the prehensile edges in contact 
throughout. Although the single male seen is very large, there is no 
sign whatever of the expansion of the chela at the base of the digits, 
due largely to a curvature in the basal part of the propodal digit, 
which seems to be characteristic of the old males of all the species of 
the genus. 

The dorsal surface of the abdomen is sculptured very much like the 
carapax, and the second and third somites are each armed with a series of 
small spines along the anterior edge above the facet, but there are no 
similar spines on the succeeding somites. The epimera of the second to 
the sixth somite are short, and obtusely rounded below, but those of the 
second and fifth are broader than the others. The telson and uropods 
are as in M. Bamffia. 

As in all the other species of the genus which I have seen, the append- 
ages of the first abdominal somite are shorter than those of the second, 
and composed of a slender protopod and a single thin lamella, which 
is much shorter than the protopod, broad, obtuse at the distal extremity, 
with a few marginal seta?, and rolled together anteriorly into a spoon- 
shaped appendage; while the protopod in the second pair of appendages 
is much longer than in the first, and bears a narrow, setigerous, and 
somewhat twisted lamella, with a minute rudiment of a second lamella 
at its base. The appendages of the third, fourth, and fifth somites 
are alike, and in each the protopod (apparently) is expanded into a 
broad oval lamella, margined with long setre along the outer edge and 
at the tip, and bearing, on the inside near the tip, a small styliform 
appendage, composed of two segments. In the female the appendages 
of the second somite, though apparently not ovigerous, are about half 
as long as those of the third, with the protopod about as long as the 
endopod, which is composed of two subequal segments, and all the 
segments bear numerous long plumose setae ; the appendages of the 
third, fourth, and fifth somites are ovigerous, alike, nearly equal in size, 
and the two distal segments are subequal in length, and each about 
as long as the protopod.

Eumunida, gen. no v. 

The single species of the genus here proposed has the general ap- 
pearance of Munida, but is at once distinguished from it and all the 
allied genera by the five-spined front, the position and structure of the 
peduncles of the antennas, the absence of branchiae at the bases of the 
external maxillipeds, the very broad and transversely segmented telson, 
and the absence of appendages upon the first five somites of the abdo- 
men of the male. 

The carapax is strongly contracted below anteriorly, so that the 
peduncles of the antennae are near together and immediately beneath 
the well-developed eyes. The proximal segment of the peduncle of 
antennula is slender, subcylindrical, but with a small protuberance 
near the base where the auditory organ is situated, and unarmed. The 
peduncle of the antenna is highly developed and armed with numerous 
spines, of which one is articulated by a broad base to the second seg- 
ment and evidently represents the antennal scale. The oral appendages 
and thoracic legs are similar to those of Munida, but there are neither 
branchiae nor epipods at the bases of the external maxillipeds, though 
in other respects the branchial formula is the same. The telson is short 
and broad, more or less membranaceous, and divided by a transverse 
articulation, so that the distal part may be folded beneath the basal 
part. The female has well-developed appendages, all apparently ovig- 
erous, upon the second to the fifth somite of the abdomen, but there 
are no appendages whatever on any of the first five somites in the adult 
male. 

Eumunida picta, sp. nov. (PI. 2, Fig. 2; PI. 3, Figs. 6-10 ; PI. 4, Figs. l-3«.) 
The carapax at the posterior part of the branchial region is about as

broad as the length, excluding the rostrum, but is rapidly narrowed ante- 
riorly, and at the bases of the antennae is scarcely halt* as broad. Back 
of the cervical suture the dorsal surface is regularly convex transversely, 
but the anterior part of the elevated gastric region is flat or slightly con- 
cave, and the orbital margins are perpendicular and hidden from above 
by the bases of the supraorbital spines. The anterior edge of the front 
is slightly arcuate and armed with Ave slender, acute, and subcylindri- 
cal spines, a median with two supraorbital each side; the median, or 
rostrum proper, is about half as long as the rest of the carapax, straight 
and horizontal; the supraorbital spines each side are approximately 
parallel with the rostrum, but directed slightly upward so that their 
tips are a little above the plane of the rostrum, are separated from the 
rostrum more widely than from each other, and the inner is nearly 
three-fourths as long as the rostrum while the outer is scarcely half as 
long as the inner. Immediately back of the outer of these spines there 
is a prominent and acute spine directed forward, and on a line between 
this and the hepatic spine of the lateral margin there are two much 
smaller spines on the steep side of the gastric region back of the orbit. 
The lateral margin is arcuate in outline and armed with seven acute 
spiniform teeth directed forward and decreasing successively in size 
posteriorly; the anterior, or anteunal, is separated from the base of the 
antenua by a considerable space and is nearly as long as the outer 
supraorbital spine, the second is on the hepatic region, and the remain- 
ing five are all on the branchial region, the posterior one being very 
small in adult specimens and nearly or quite obsolete in young speci- 
mens 15 mm in length. The dorsal surface is marked with transverse 
ruga?, is sparsely clothed with minute hairs, and, except the spines 
already mentioned, is unarmed. The cervical suture is well marked 
and the gastro-hepatic distinct. The infero-lateral region is of nearly 
the same form as in the typical species of Munida and terminates ante- 
riorly in an acute spine a little in front of the first lateral spine. 

The eyes are black, smaller than in the typical species of Munida, 
nearly globular, and are borne on short stalks, the whole length being 
scarcely more than a fourth greater than the diameter of the cornea. 

The peduncle of the antennula reaches to about the tip of the ros- 
trum ; the segments are all approximately equal in length, nearly naked, 
entirely unarmed, slender, andsubcylindrical, though the proximal seg- 
ment is considerably stouter than the others, and has a conspicuous 
protuberance over the auditory organ. The upper flagellum is about 
as long as the distal segment of the peduncle, swollen toward the base, 
and tapered to a very slender tip. The lower flagellum is very slender 
throughout and shorter than the upper. The peduncle of the antenna 
reaches to about the tip of the second segment of the peduncle of the 
antennula, and is armed with numerous spines; the first segment is ex- 
posed at the antero-lateral augle.of the carapax and projects anteriorly 
in a sharp tooth ; the second segment is very short, armed externally 



46 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

with a stout dentiform spine directed forward, and above bears a slen. 
der spiniform appendage curved slightly upward and outward, and a 
little longer than the fourth segment ; the third segment projects below 
the fourth segment in a slender spiniform process reaching by the 
fourth segment; the fourth segment is nearly as long as the diamete 
of the eye, beyond which it reaches considerably, and is armed at the 
distal end by a long spine projecting beneath and beyond the ultimate 
segment, and above and on the outer side by two small teeth; the ulti- 
mate segment is little more than half as long as the fourth, about once 
and a half as long as broad, and armed at the distal end with three 
long and approximately equal and equidistant spines. The flagellum 
is nearly as long as the whole body, slender, slightly compressed verti- 
cally, sparsely armed with minute seta3, and, at long intervals, with 
a few very long and slender setse. 

The mandibles and maxilla} are very nearly as in Munida Bamffia, 
but the proximal lobe of the protognath of the first maxilla is broader 
and less prolonged and more obtusely rounded anteriorly. 

The proximal lobe of the protopod of the first niaxilliped projects 
very little anteriorly, and the distal lobe is fully twice as long as broad. 
The endopod projects considerably beyond the protopod, is less curved 
than in Muni da Bamffia, scarcely at all tapered distally, and clothed 
with slender setae along the inner edge and at the obtuse tip. The 
basal portion of the exopod is longer than the endopod, from a sixth to 
an eighth as broad as long, sparsely setigerous along the edges, and 
bears a slender flagellum slightly less than half as long as the basal 
part, and obscurely multiarticulate distally. The epipod is small, about 
half as long as the endopod, tapered to the tip, and setigerous distally. 

The second niaxilliped resembles closely that of Munida Bamffia, but 
the endopod is shorter and stouter, the merus being scarcely more than 
twice as long as broad, and the basal part of the exopod is a little 
shorter, scarcely narrowed distally, and somewhat less setigerous. 

The ischium and merus in the external niaxilliped are approximately 
equal in length, the ischium unarmed at the distal end, but with the 
inner angle dentate as usual; the merus is only very slightly expanded 
on the inner side, and bears only a small spine near the distal end; the 
propodus is narrow, with a very slight expansion on the inner side; and 
the dactylus is considerably smaller than the propodus, and subcylin. 
drical. The basal part of the exopod does not reach the distal end of 
the merus. There are no rnaxillipedal arthrobranchire, as there are in 
the species of Munida. 

The chelipeds are not far from three times as long as the carapax, 
including the rostrum, and are apparently not much shorter propor- 
tionally in tiic females and young than in the adult males. The merus 
is subcylindrical, considerably longer than the carapax, including the 
rostrum, and is armed with four longitudinal series of spines, of which 
those forming the two series on the inner side are much larger than 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 47 

those of the outer series, and these larger still than those of the lower 
series, which are quite small; there are eight to twelve of the larger 
spines in each series, and the surface between the spines, and also on 
the carpus and the body of the chela, is roughened with small squami- 
form and sparsely setigerous elevations. The carpus is short and armed 
with three distal spines on the inner side, and with a few small spines 
and tubercles on the outer side. The chela is just about as long as the 
merns and no stouter; the body is subeylindrical, considerably longer 
than the digits, and armed along the inner side with two series of spines 
corresponding with the two inner series on the merus, but the spines 
are much smaller and more crowded; the digits are slender, nearly 
straight laterally, but curved slightly downward at the tips, and the 
prehensile edges are irregularly dentate. 

The first pair of ambulatory legs reach about to the middle of the 
carpi of the chelipeds ; the dorsal edge of the merus is compressed and 
armed with a series of about ten large spines ; the anteroinferior angle 
is armed with a similar series of much smaller spines, and there is, in 
addition, a large spine on the posterior side below the articulation with 
the carpus ; the carpus is short and crested above with a series of spines 
like the merus, and the posterior side in both carpus and merus is rough- 
ened like the surface of the chelipeds ; fhe propodus is about as long as 
the merus, slender, compressed laterally, with a few long set* on the 
upper edge and a series of short spiniform seta3 below, but without true 
spines or teeth ; the dactylus is nearly half as long as the propodus, 
broad, strongly compressed, terminates in a strong chitinous tip, and is 
armed below with a closely set series of setiform chitinous spines de- 
creasing in size proximally. The second pair are like the first, except 
that the merus is unarmed below. The third pair are considerably 
shorter than the second, reaching scarcely to the tips of the propodi of 
the second pair, and there is a series of small spines along the middle 
posterior side of the merus, but in other respects they are like the third 
pair. 

The posterior pair of thoracic legs are much shorter than in the typical 
species of Munida, being only about as long as the meri of the third pair 
of ambulatory legs; the merus and carpus are about equal in length, 
and each is considerably longer than the ischium ; the chela is little 
more than half as long as the carpus, but swollen distally, so as to be 
much broader, and the prehensile edge of the propodus and the articu- 
lation with short, stout, and strongly curved dactylus is terminal and 
nearly transverse, the propodal digit being reduced to a slight angular 
projection. The chela aud distal end of the carpus are densely clothed 
with long seta 1 . 

The consolidated sternal plates between the bases of the chelipeds 
and true ambulatory legs are marked by a deep longitudinal median 
sulcus on each somite, are separated from each other by conspicuous 
sidci, and the plate between the bases of the chelipeds is armed each 



48 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

side with a small spiniforni tooth projecting forward, and the plane of 
the plate is much below the very narrow sternal plate at the bases of 
the external maxillipeds. The sternum of the last thoracic somite is 
entirely membranaceous, without any calcified plate or bar between the 
bases of the posterior legs. 

The abdomen is broad, evenly rounded above, and without longitudi- 
nal carina 3 ; the epimera are all very short; and the sterna of all the 
somites are almost entirely membranaceous, like that of the last thoracic 
somite. The dorsum of the first somite rises in a sharp and very nar- 
row transverse ridge back of the facet which slides beneath the carapax, 
and is inclosed either side by the anterior projection of the epimera of 
the second somite. The epimeron of the second somite is truncated 
below, but projects forward in a sharp angle at the side of the carapax, 
and above the angle is armed with a large, curved, and acute spine, 
directed forward above the lateral margin of the carapax. The epimera 
of the third, fourth, and fifth somites are truncated, with the angles 
more or less rounded, and those of the sixth obtuse. The second and 
third somites are each marked above by two transverse ciliated ruga?, 
the fourth and fifth each by three similar but less conspicuous rugre in 
adults, or only two in the young, and the sixth somite and all the 
epimera are marked by broken and irregular rug?e or squamiform ele- 
vations. The sixth somite is much longer than the fifth, about a third 
as long as broad, and the postero-lateral edge outside the articulation 
of the uropod is oblique and nearly straight. 

The telson in full grown specimens is only as long as the sixth somite, 
and twice as broad as long, but in young specimens is proportionally 
longer and narrower. The whole appendage is thin and slightly calci- 
fied; the lateral margins are deeply incised about the middle and the 
incisions connected by a transverse membranous articulation, so that 
the distal part is readily folded beneath the proximal. The distal part 
is notched at the middle of the posterior edge and longitudinally divided 
by a membranous line, so that it appears to be formed of two trans- 
verse elliptical plates, each nearly twice as broad as long, and of which 
the posterior and lateral edges are thickly ciliated. The inner lamella 
of the uropod is fully as long as the telson, about two-thirds as broad 
as long, elliptical, the inner and distal edges armed with spines, which 
are small on the inner and very minute and crowded on the distal edge, 
and the entire margin, except near the base, is ciliated with numerous 
long hairs. The outer lamella is longer and broader than the inner, 
narrowed and somewhat excavated on the inner edge near the base, 
and margined with hairs like the inner. 

There are no appendages whatever on any of the first five abdominal 
somites in any of the adult males examined. In young specimens, 15 mm 
or less in length, in which the sexual characters are not manifest, but 
which are possibly immature males, or more probably immature females, 
there are, however, on the second to the fifth somite, rudimentary, very

minute, and naked appendages, obscurely divided into a large proximal 
and a small distal segment. In the adult female the appendages of the 
second to the fifth somite are similar, approximately alike in size, appar- 
ently all ovigerous, and each appears to be composed of only two seg- 
ments, of which the distal is about half as long as the proximal. None 
of the specimens seen are carrying eggs.

In the specimen from station 1152, after preservation in alcohol for a 
short time, the coloration had apparently not changed very materially, 
and was very striking. The whole dorsal surface of the carapax and 
abdomen was light red, lightest on the abdomen and darkest on the ros- 
trum and spines of the carapax. The chelipeds and three pairs of am- 
bulatory legs were very intense bright red, except the digits of the chelae

and the distal extremities of the ambulatory legs to very near the bases 
of the propodi, which parts were white, the color stopping on each of 
these appendages very suddenly at the point where they cease to be 
armed with spines. All the other specimens show more or less distinct 
indications of the same coloration. 

Anoplonotua politus, gen. et sp. nov. (PI. 2, Fig. 1 ; PI. 3, Figs. l-5a.) 

Excluding the rostrum, the carapax is nearly as broad as long ; includ- 
ing the rostrum, seven to eight tenths as broad as long, the rostrum 
being rather less than a fourth of the entire length. The rostrum is 
vertically flattened, though obscurely carinated longitudinally above, 
horizontally triangular, but not acute at the tip, and slightly curved 
downward distally. There are no spines or tubercles upon the carapax, 
but the gastric region is somewhat protuberant and separated from the 
branchial regions by a broad sulcus each side, and from the prominent 
cardiac region by a still deeper sulcus which extends either side as a 
shallow sulcus across the branchial region, which is again crossed by a 
narrower sulcus in front, but the cardiac region is not conspicuously 
separated from the branchial region either side of it. The orbital por- 
tion of the anterior margin is narrow and advanced considerably in 
front of the antero lateral angles, which are formed by the hepatic 
regions and are nearly right-angular. The lateral margins are slightly 
curved, and the greatest breadth is a little back of the middle. The 
surface of the carapax is granulose, particularly along the sides, where 
the granules are arranged in transverse lines. 

The small eyes are partially beneath the rostrum, and scarcely reach 
its middle; there is a slight protuberance on the outer side of the stalk 
near the base ; and the eye itself is semitranslucent in the alcoholic 
specimens ; its diameter is rather less than that of the stalk and about 
half the whole length, and the cornea is apparently entirely without 
facets. 

The basal segment of the peduncle of the antennula is a little shorter 
than the rostrum, about three-fourths as broad as long, somewhat 
swollen on the outer side, and armed with two teeth at the distal extrem- 
ity. The second and third segments are slender, subequal in length- 
and each scarcely as long as the basal. The upper flagellum is about 
as long as the distal segment of the peduncle, the basal portion swollen 
and composed of numerous short segments, while the distal portion is 
very slender and composed of about five elongated segments. The lower 
flagellum is little more than half as long as the upper, slender through- 
out, and composed of about three segments. The peduncle of the an- 
tenna arises just outside the peduncle of the antennula and at some 
distance from the antero-lateral angle of the carapax, scarcely reaches 
the tip of the rostrum, and its three distal segments are slender. The 
flagellum is very slender, and reaches to about the tips of the cheli- 
peds. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 51 

The mandibles are of essentially the same form as in Munida; the 
molar area is transverse to the body of the mandible, narrow, naked, 
and separated from the broad and edentulous ventral process by a deep 
excavation ; and the palpus is slender, triarticulate, and armed with 
few and short setae. The protognathal lobes of the first maxilla are 
approximately equal in size, rather broad at the ends, and armed as 
usual with slender spines upon the distal, and numerous setoa upon the 
proximal lobe. The endognath is much shorter than the distal lobe of 
the protognath, slender, tapered to an obtuse point, and armed with 
two series of small setae, one at the tip and the other below the middle. 
The protognathal lobes of the second maxilla are approximately equal 
in size, and each lobe is divided into two lobules vtiy unequal in width, 
the two middle lobules being approximately a third as wide as the an- 
terior and posterior, though all four of the lobules are of about the 
same length. The endognath is a little longer than the distal lobe of 
the protognath, tapers to a slender tip, and is armed with a very few 
setae along the middle of its length. The anterior portion of the sca- 
phognath is a little shorter than the endognath, broad, slightly narrowed 
anteriorly, but broad and obtusely rounded at the tip, while the poste- 
rior portion is short, transversely truncated behind, broader than long, 
and somewhat triangular in outline, with the angles rounded. 

The tips of the lobes of the protopod of the first maxilliped are rounded 
and nearly alike, but the distal lobe is considerably longer than the 
proximal, being about twice as long as broad. The endopod is about 
as long as the distal lobe of the protopod, narrow, tapered to an obtuse 
tip, very strongly curved, the outer edge margined with slender setae 
distally, and proximally with a very few setae near the inner edge. The 
exopod is lamellar, a little longer than the endopod and much broader, 
being about a fifth as broad as long, rapidly narrowed at the extremity, 
and margined with slender setae along the outer ed<;e. The epipod is 
about as broad but scarcely as long as the distal lobe of the protopod, 
triangular at the extremity, and ciliated at the tip and along the outer 
edge. The endopod of the second maxilliped is of nearly equal breadth 
from the base to the dactylus; the ischium is scarcely longer than 
broad; the merus nearly three times as long as broad and about as long 
as the three terminal segments taken together; the carpus and propo- 
dus are subequal in length; the dactylus is shorter and much narrower 
than the propodus, and rounded at the tip ; and all the segments are 
more or less armed as usual with setae of different forms, and at the 
distal end of the inner edge there is a single slender spine or spiniform 
setae in addition to a few short setae. The exopod is much larger than 
the endopod; the unsegmented basal portion is nearly uniform in 
breadth for about the proximal two-thirds of its length, where it expands 
in an obtuse prominence opposite the carpus of the endopod, bat from 
this prominence it tapers to the articulation with the slender llagellum ; 
except near the tip both edges are margined with short setae, and the 



52 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

prominence of the inner edge bears in addition a submarginal series of 
six to eight long setse; the flagellum is about half as long as the basal 
part, distinctly articnlated near the middle, and the terminal fourth of 
the whole length very obscurely multiarticulate and furnished with long 
setse. 

The external maxillipeds, when extended, reach a little by the tip of 
the rostrum ; the ischium is nearly twice as long as broad and triquetral, 
with the dorso-internal angle sharply and regularly dentate; themerus 
is slightly shorter than the ischium, nearly as broad as long, expanded 
distally and armed with two obtuse teeth on the inner side and with a 
single tooth outside the articulation of the carpus; the three distal seg- 
ments are slender and together about equal in length to the ischium 
and merus, the propodns being about as long as the merus, and the 
carpus and dactylus successively a little shorter. The epipod and ex- 
opod are well developed, and the basal part of latter reaches considera- 
bly by the merus. 

The chelipeds are equal and about three times as long as the carapax, 
the merus being about as long as the carapax, and the chela considera- 
bly longer. In the females and young males the chelipeds are very 
slender and subcylindrical throughout, with the chela scarcely, if at 
all, stouter than the carpus, and with the digits straight and very 
slender. In the large males the chelipeds are very much stouter; the 
body of the chela is expanded and vertically flattened distally, and the 
digits gape widely at the base, the proximal half of the propodal digit 
being strongly curved and unarmed, while the distal part of the pre- 
hensile edge is straight and minutely serrate like the corresponding 
part of the dactylus, with which it is in contact when the digits are 
closed; the basal part of the dactylus is only slightly curved, but is 
armed with an obtuse tubercle on the prehensile edge near the base; 
and the whole prehensile edges of both digits are more or less hairy. 

The three pairs of ambulatory legs are slender and subequal in 
length, about as long as the body, and the dactyli are slender, strongly 
curved, more than half as long as the propodi, and unarmed. The pos- 
terior legs are very small and slender and of essentially the same form 
as in Mumda. There are no epipods at the bases of any of the thoracic 
legs. 

The abdomen is considerably shorter and much narrower than the 
carapax, and its dorsal surface is nearly smooth and devoid of carina 1 , 
except on the edges of the sixth somite, as described beyond, thougli 
there is a slight transverse sulcus on the middle portion of the second 
somite, which is also raised sharply above the small facet which slides 
under the carapax. The epimera of the second somite are broad ; the 
third and fourth somites are short, and their epimera very narrow and 
acute; the fifth somite is a little longer than the fourth, and its epimera 
broader and more obtuse than those of the fourth; while the sixth 
somite is slightly louger than the fifth, and the posterolateral margins

of its epimera are excavated to fit accurately the outer edges of the 
bases of the uropods, aud are margined with a narrow carina. 

The telson is approximately two-thirds as long as broad, narrowed 
posteriorly, with the posterior angles rounded and the posterior edge 
slightly emarginate in the middle. The telson is stiffened by eight 
distinct calcified plates ; a broad median basal plate, with a small one 
either side at the base of the uropod and a small median one behind it 
and between a pair of broad lateral plates, still behind which there is a 
second pair which meet in the middle line and form the tips and lateral 
angles. 

The lamella? of the uropods are about as long as the telson, a little 
longer thau wide, the inner slightly longer than the outer, and each 
widest near the extremity, which is broadly rounded in outline, while 
the outer edge is nearly straight. 

In the male the first and second pairs of abdominal appendages are 
well developed and of nearly the same form as in the species of Munida. 
Those of the first pair are about as long as the protopods of the second 
pair, with the protopod somewhat triquetral and naked except a few 
setaj along the distal part of the inner edge, and with the single ter- 
minal lamella slightly shorter than the protopod but much broader, very 
thin, margined with setas distally and along the outer edge, and the 
edges rolled together on the anterior side. In the second pair the pro- 
topod is slender aud naked, and bears a narrow, lanceolate lamella a 
little shorter than the protopod and clothed with numerous seta3 along 
both edges and on the proximal part of the anterior side, and at its 
base a minute second lamella much narrower than the other, scarcely 
as broad as long, and naked. The appendages of the third, fourth, and 
fifth somites are rudimentary, very minute, and almost wholly naked; 
they are scarcely an eighth as long as the appendages of the second 
somite, very slender, and with a single terminal lamella smaller than 
the protopod. Iu the female there are no appendages upon the first 
somite of the abdomen, and the appendages of the second somite are 
very minute, slender, and tipped with a few small seta3. The append- 
ages of the third, fourth, and fifth somites are well developed, unira- 
nious, and ovigerous; they increase in size successively from the third to 
the fifth, and each appendage is composed of a slender protopod and a 
shorter terminal portion composed of two segments of which the termi- 
nal is the longer. 

• The eggs in the alcoholic specimens are approximately spherical, 
1.50 ram to 1.75 mm in diameter, aud very few in number, the two largest 
egg-bearing specimens carrying less than thirty eggs each, while the 
three smaller specimens carry nine, three, and two each, though a very 
few eggs may have been lost from these last specimens.

In the manuscript sent to the printer I referred this species to Elas- 
monotus with considerable hesitation, though it agreed very well with 
the brief diagnosis given by Milne-Edwards (Bull. Mas. Comp. Zool. 
Cambridge, viii, p. GO). The recently published figures of B. VaillantU 
(Eecueil de figures de Crustaces nouveau ou peu connus, April, 1883), 
however, seem to show that my species is generically as well as spe- 
cifically distinct iroin Elasmonotus, being distinguished by the short 
and broad merus of the external maxilliped, the absence of spines, 
teeth, or carina' upon the carapax and abdomen, and by the greater 
breadth of the carapax, if the measurements given by Milne-Edwards, 
are correct.* The species here described is apparently also distin- 
guished generically by the small and non-segmented exopod of the first 
maxilliped, and specially by the rudimentary character of the append- 
ages of the third, fourth, and fifth somites of the abdomen. The number

* There is a perplexing disagreement in Milne-Edwards's characterization of his 
species between the descriptions of the proportions of the carapax and the accom- 
panying measurements. E. orcrimanus and aldominalis are each said to have the cara- 
pax narrower ("plus e"troite") than E. longimanus, though the measurements given 
show E. Irevimanus to be very much, and E. abdominalis slightly, broader than E. 
longimanus.

NO. 1.-N0TES ON THE NATURAL HISTORY, INCLUDING DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW CETA- 
CEANS. 

By LEONIIARD STEJNEGEB. 

Prof. Spencer F. Baird, 

Secretary Smithsonian Institution, 

Director U. S. National Museum : 

Dear Sir: As announced in my letter from San Francisco, the 
steamer "Alexander" started on the 5th of April at noon. The wind 
was very unfavorable, most of the time blowing from the west, and 
very often with a force of 40 miles an hour or more. Up to the 24th 
my observations show twice only a direction of wind from a different 
quarter. As we were compelled to make about one thousand miles under 
sail, our progress was necessarily slow, so that on the 23d of April we 
found ourselves only in longitude 145° west, and latitude 50° 35' north, 
about 500 miles southwest from Sitka, and as many miles southeast 
from Kodiak. On the 30th of April we passed the Aleutian chain be- 
tween Seguain and Amlia, in fog and sleet, and Bering Sea received us 
with a veritable hurricane from the east-northeast. After having 
stopped at the village of Copper Island the anchor was dropped in the 
morning of the 7th of May at Gavan, the harbor of Bering Island, 
where I landed with as much of my baggage as could be taken on 
shore before the cargo had been discharged in Petropaulski. Ere long 
I was comfortably lodged and began my work. 

At first I was much confined to my station on account of the meteoro- 
logical observations. Not until the obliging agent of the Alaska Com- 
mercial Company, Mr. G. Chernick, had been instructed how to take 
and record these observations, could I think of making longer excur- 
sions. Many thanks are due to him for his kind assistance. Thus I 
was unable to cross the northern part of the island, consisting chiefly 
of flat swamps and tundras, of lakes, a moderately high plateau, and 
a chain of interesting table mountains of about the same height, while 
the southern, mountainous and larger, two-thirds of the island remained 
a complete terra incognita to me. I therefore planned an expedition 
with the purpose of exploring the secrets of this region, the more as it 
was especially there that Steller had made his observations. But I had 
to wait until the sealing season was over, for all hands now were occu- 
pied in this, their chief, and one may safely say, only work. 

Meanwhile I resolved to go to Petropaulski on the lGth of June to 
establish a meteorological station, and to hire and train an observer. 
Besides, it was my desire to study as much of the natural history of 
Kamtschatka as the surroundings and the limited time would j)erniit. 



PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 59 

The season was unfavorable, as the vegetation was already so luxuri- 
ant as to make it difficult to move outside of the roads, and the mos- 
quitos were plentiful enough to make it extremely painful to lay in wait 
for birds or to creep around searching for spiders, beetles, and snails. 
However, if the stay was not very profitable to the collection, it was not 
entirely without results, for I gained a great deal of valuable experience 
which will be of use to me during my proposed visit to Kamtschatka 
next year. What rendered my sojourn there especially attractive and 
instructive was the daily intercourse with the experienced and merito- 
rious explorer of Eastern Asia, Dr. Benedict Dybowski, who, of course, 
better than any one else, could give me all desirable information. On 
the 15th of July I found myself again on Bering Island. 

The following weeks were occupied chiefly by observations on the 
rookery, about 15 miles distant from the village, and I could not begin 
to think about the expedition towards the south before the middle of 
August. 

Every one suggested that the most practicable way would be to go 
around the island in a boat, as traveling overland with dogs would be 
difficult and expensive, and, on the other hand, several places of inter- 
est would be inaccessible by this route, which, besides, would offer lit- 
tle or no opportunity for carrying the necessary outfit and the objects 
of natural history I might possibly collect during the journey. The 
prospect of finding a skeleton of a sea-cow at any one of these places, 
seldom or never visited by the natives, was a very probable one, and as 
such a skeleton alone would be enough to load a boat even larger than 
ours, I resolved to hire six Aleuts, to man the boat of Mr. Grebnitzky, 
kindly placed at my disposal. Mr. Osche, in the service of the Alaska 
Company, who during a sojourn of several years had traversed the 
island in all directions on his hunting expeditions, and had thereby 
gained an extensive knowledge of the island and its products, joined 
the expedition as a volunteer; an assistance the more valuable, as 
without it I should hardly have been able to realize my intention. 

The special object of the expedition was to study the general natural 
history of the southern part of the island, to collect specimens of all 
kinds, as far as circumstances would permit ; but especially to search 
for remains of the sea-cow. I also proposed to survey the island for fur- 
ther explorations, and to collect material for a more correct and detailed 
map than the one in existence. Besides I wished to identify the places 
mentioned by Steller in his narrative, in order to compare his description 
with the localities as they present themselves to-day, and to restore the 
original names. I also desired to visit the spots where Bering's vessel 
was wrecked, where the ill-fated expedition wintered and where Steller 
made his observations on the sea-cow. 

The "circumnavigation" took place between August 21 and the 1st 
of September. It was attended by all the disagreeable consequences 
of fog and rain, of wind and surf, and the few skins which could be

obtained under these circumstances were almost spoiled at our return. 
The personal inconveniences during a 12 days' journey on the ocean, 
along an open coast without harbors or anything like a shelter; of being 
kept wet by continuous fogs and rains; of sleeping under an old sail, 
are serious; but no naturalist would ever count them should the result 
of his work be in inverse proportion to his troubles. 

Unfortunately, 1 cannot so report, because the animal life, contrary to 
my expectations, was much poorer with regard to species than in the 
northern part, although the number of individuals was considerably 
larger. In fact, the only addition to my list of birds observed on the 
island was a single species, Rissa brevirostris Brandt, a species strangely 
limited in its distribution on the island. 

I inspected a large colony of Rissa Jcotzebui Bp., situated on the west- 
ern shore, about 18 miles from Cape Manati, the southwestern point of 
the island, where thousands and thousands of this black-legged Kitti- 
wake were now feeding their almost full-grown young ones. Among 
them a single red-legged bird, quite lonely, and apparently without any 
young, had placed itself on a narrow shelf of the rocky wall. It was 
the first and the only one I saw, and I was fortunate enough to shoot 
it. it. Icotzebui was observed in countless numbers along the western 
shore ; but as soon as we had doubled Cape Manati we met as large or 
still larger flocks of R. brevirostris, among which not a single black- 
legged individual could be detected. I minutely surveyed a breeding 
colony on this side, and the result was the same, not a single black- 
legged one was seen. And thus the red-legged form completely excluded 
the other along i\m, eastern shore, except at Cape Tonkoj, where the coast 
trends towards the northwest. Here on the cape a larger flock of Kitti- 
wakes was sitting on the shore so closely packed that only the legs of 
the outer row could be seen; they were all red. I shot, however, and 
of the ten lying on the ground, seven were red-legged, while three be- 
longed to the black-legged species. The young of Rissa brevirostris 
also has dark legs, but I need not expressly state that I did not make 
any mistake in this respect. 

On the. other side of the last-mentioned cape the old acquaintance 
received us as exclusively as along the western shore. Thus, the genus 
Rissa occupies the whole shore-line of the island, of which Jcotzebui, 
however, has usurped nine-tenths, leaving to brevirostris, as an exclu- 
sive possession, but one-tenth, or about 12 miles. 

We found, however, another animal, which I much regretted not to 
have been able to skin and to carry with me. But, as it was a Balai- 
noptera, 50 feet long, I was compelled to leave it where it was found. 
I spent a day on the spot in order to take the necessary measurements, 
and to make such investigations as the far-advanced decomposition of 
the carcass would allow, as a matter of course. I need not state that 
while this business was to some extent a veritable pleasure to the nat- 
uralist, it was not agreeable at all to the civilized man. Further on I 
shall give some details of the examination. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. Gl 

But now as to the sea-cow. We found the remains of one, and I will 
here give an extract from my journal concerning this event. 

August 27, 1882, Cape Tolstoj — Mr. Osche went out hunting, while I 
was occupied in searching for fossils. From the extreme point of the 
cape I took some bearings of the other capes visible from here, and 
was just looking over my collections of stones when Mr. Osche returned 
with the cheerful message that he had found what he thought to be a 
skeleton of a sea-cow. Immediately we seized the spades and set out 
for the place. Having removed some spades full of soil, I soon became 
convinced that his supposition was right, but at the same time it was 
evident that the skeleton was in such a bad state of preservation that 
it would hardly be of any use. It was situated in a sand-bank 12 feet 
high, about equally distant from the base and from the top of the 
shore, close to a rivulet, which here had cut its bed through the bank 
and carried away the whole caudal portion of the skeleton. The dis- 
tance from the sea was 500 feet in a straight line, and the height above 
high tide not less than 10 to 12 feet. The head of the skeleton pointed 
towards the west. It was lying horizontally on the back, slightly bent 
towards the left ; most of the bones were in their natural position. The 
top of the sand-bank was covered with thick sod, and both above and 
below the skeleton the bank consisted of moist and rather fine sand, of 
the same kind daily washed up on the beach and deposited in horizontal 
and alternating blue and brown layers, the latter color greatly predomi- 
nating. The color of the sand near the bones was blackish, sometimes 
iridescent. In spite of the miserable condition of the bones, I finished 
the exhumation in order to ascertain whether all parts were in their 
proper place. This caused us much pain and labor, not only because 
the sand had to be removed from the very top, but especially because 
the fine particles of the upper and dry layers were whirled by the strong 
breeze into our eyes. 

Altogether, fourteen dorsal vertebrae with their ribs, the cervical 
vertebra?, the skull and sternum, two scapulae, two humeri, and one 
cubitus were dug out; the other cubitus could not be found, nor any 
trace of a metacarpal bone. While all the other parts w T ere found in 
situ, the sternum was lying outside, close to the right extremity, while 
the left one, consisting of a scapula and humerus only, was placed 
within the throat, close to the spine. 

As stated above, the bones were in a miserable state of preservation, 
being decomposed in a very high degree, and so brittle as to be incapa- 
ble of bearing their own weight, falling into many pieces when lifted 
out, even with the greatest care. Even the ribs, which are so hard that 
they present the appearance of ivory, were entirely rotten. Some 
bones had the consistency of flesh, while other parts would glide away 
between the fingers like soft soap. All the bones were of a dark red- 
dish-brown color. 

The impossibility of securing anything of value under such circum- 



62 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

stances is self-evident. I therefore selected only a few of the best pre- 
served bones, namely, the first and seventh ribs of the right side, and 
the os occipitis, in order to show the state of preservation. They form 
No. 1601 of my catalogue. 

We did not return, however, without having our boat trimmed with 
bones of Rytina, mostly ribs, from the same skeleton, and two skulls, one 
being very fragmentary. 

Of plants I collected only those not met within the northern por- 
tion, which are only a few species. The topographical part of my work 
was more successful than the zoological. 

I had the opportunity of mapping this part of the island and can give 
a tolerably correct representation of this, the most western link of the 
Aleutian chain. It differs considerably from the old charts, which show 
deep gulfs where the coast line is actually straight, and land where we 
gaily sailed our boat. 

I also visited the place of Bering's death, and the winter quarters of 
the ill-fated party, and spent two days in digging and surveying. The 
ruins of the house were measured and described, but my intention of 
making a sketch-map and some landscape sketches of the surroundings, 
was completely frustrated by the never-ceasing rain. The remains found 
were very scanty ; some small glass beads and plates of mica, prob- 
ably for trading purposes ; a few iron grape-shot, fragments of a brass 
plate with Russian armorial ensigns, bolts, and sheaves from the vessel, 
&c. I have kept these relics, as perhaps the National Museum will be 
interested in receiving the only remains of this expedition. 

I omit further details here, for this letter is intended to contain zoolog- 
ical data only. Besides, I have no copy of Steller's journal ; and, finally, 
because I propose to revisit the place in order to complete my observa- 
tions and to take the sketches above mentioned. 

I am unable to send you at present a full description of the islands, 
as my sojourn here has scarcely exceeded three months. The following 
pages will contain merely some disconnected sketches of those things I 
consider to be new or of special interest. You will see, besides, that they 
are, with a few exceptions, limited to the land fauna, as this, of course, 
has been the main object of my studies and observations. The collec- 
tions of marine animals are as yet insignificant. 

My stay here has as yet been too short, of course, to allow of exhaust- 
ive generalizations with regard to the zoological relations of the islands, 
the more as I have been able to identify with certainty only a small por- 
tion of the animals which 1 have collected. But I do not hesitate to 
state that the character of the land fauna is pahparctic, as it has been 
supposed to be. Such being the case, you will not find it surprising 
that the fauna! character of the island agrees more or less with that of 
Kamtschatka. 

Although I am not prepared at present to give the reasons for my 
hypothesis, I still should like to remark that several facts show that 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 63 

the islands during the period previous to -which they received their pre- 
sent fauna and flora were totally covered by the sea, and that since 
that time they have Dot been connected with the mainland on either 
side. From this it would follow that none of the species occurring 
here are true indigenes. They evidently immigrated, especially and more 
regularly from the west, from Asia, by means of prevailing winds, cur- 
rents, and the driftwood carried by these, and more accidentally from 
the east, from America. That the inhabitants, more independent of 
those circumstances, likewise show nearer relationship to the Asiatic 
fauna is partly due to the shorter distance, this being only 100 miles 
from the nearest cape of Kamtschatka, Cape Kronotski (which by the 
Russian man-of-war Vestnik this year has been found to be situated 20 
miles more to the westward than given in the charts), while the nearest 
island of the Aleutian chain, Attu, is twice as far off; and partly to the 
effort of the Asiatic fauna to extend beyond its own limits. It is a well- 
known fact that the Asiatic fauna is in a continuous and comparatively 
rapid motion towards the west, especially in northern Europe. But it 
seems to me that a similar movement takes place in the eastern part of 
Asia, ouly in an opposite direction, the proof of which I find in the not 
inconsiderable number of exclusively palaearctic forms in Alaska, espe- 
cially among the birds. I here enumerate only Cyanecula, Saxicola, 
PhyUopneustr, Pj/rrlntla, Parus obtectus, Cab., etc. 

It is true that the zoogeogra pineal regions overlap each other near their 
borders, but it is a remarkable fact that America contributes but very 
little to the fauna. Thus it is probable that ere long we will detect still 
more Asiatic forms in Alaska, and that hereafter it will be necessary to 
register as residents such species which at present are known only as 
temporary or casual intruders. 

The occurrence of species peculiar to the islands (and I have no doubt 
that the final revision of the material collected by me will make known 
several new ones) will not invalidate what I have stated above with 
regard to the want of indigenous animals and plants. Their origin is 
due merely to variability in connection with isolation and time. 

As to the plants I shall be very brief, as I am not a botanist. I limit 
myself to the remark that I find the general character of the flora very 
much like that of the treeless regions of JSTortbern Europe, the most dis- 
crepant features being the splendid Rhododendrons (kamtschaticum and 
chrysanthum) and the Saranna lily (Fritillaria saranna). Still closer, of 
course, is the resemblance to the plants of Kamtschatka, especially to 
those in greater altitudes. The plants of both islands are, I think, 
identical, but the manner of their immigration very likely has caused 
the occurrence of some species in one island which are absent in the 
other. Thus I have from Copper Island a small but very conspicuous 
Viola with yellow flowers (much resembling the yellow variety of V. 
tricolor), a plant which I found also in Petropaulski, but not here on 
Bering Island.

The islands are completely destitute of trees, unless one might be 
tempted to term so the shrubs of Salix, Sorbus, and Ik-tula, from G to 8 
feet high, some of which obtain a proportionally great thickness close 
to the ground. Thus, for instance, I have a section of a birch with a 
diameter of 2 inches. 

The vegetation, especially in the valleys, is very luxuriant, in most 
places of a man's height or more. This exuberance is especially due to 
the rich soil in connection with the extreme moisture, for the tempera- 
ture during the three months, during which the plants have now been 
growing, was not high. My observations show a mean of-f 42°.7 F. for 
June, 4S°.2 for July, and 54° for August. The minimum temperatures 
for the same months are 31°.3, 39°.4, and 44°.C, respectively. In higher 
latitudes the length of the day and the intensity of the light produce the 
same effect, but as we live here in latitude 55°, under a sky generally 
overcast, we do not find the same conditions as we should there. 

Of land and fresh-water invertebrates I have collected only some 
specimens of worms, mollusks, and arthropods. The worms are repre- 
sented only by a species of Lumbricus and by two Hirudhiece. 

The mollusks are more numerous, including one bivalve and two or 
three pond snails, seven land snails, and one slug. Among the land 
snails there are several extremely small Helices, scarcely larger than a 
pin's head, some of which I suspect to be new. They are surely not the 
young of the larger kinds, of which I possess young ones also of the 
same size. As a rule, all these animals are of small size, except a medium- 
sized Limnccus, and with the same exception they are not very numer- 
ous. 

Of myriapods I have found only a few species, while the spiders have 
yielded a richer harvest. 

As a rule the winged insects seem to be more numerous, with re- 
gard to both individuals and species, which is also the case near Petro- 
paulski. In the first place, the mosquitos make themselves very con- 
spicuous. Although not quite in such large numbers as in Kamtschatka, 
where the furious attacks of their legions sometimes prohibited me from 
securing a bird I had shot, and usually a valuable one, even here on the 
island they seriously interfere with the duties of a collecting naturalist. 
The diurnal lepidoptera seem to be very scarce. I have seen only a 
single one, early in the spring, on the 21st of May ; it was a butterfly, much 
like if not identical with Vanessa urticcc L., but unfortunately the chase 
was unsuccessful. My lookout for some specis of Argynnis, Erebia or 
Ticris has been completely in vain. The Xoctuina are not very numer- 
ous either, while the Geometridce and Microlepidoptera are more com- 
mon. 

The beetles are not numerous, including up to date only one or 
two CurcnUonidcc, one or two Elateridce, one Sityha, some Staphyli- 
nidw, Dytiscidcv, Gyritiidce, Cambicidcc, and a Cicindcla, which I have 
seen at only a single place, .although it is a conspicuous species.

Of crustaceans the fresh-water ponds have yielded a Branchipus, some 
GammariCke, one Daphnia, and one or two other almost microscopical 
species, which, I think, belong to Cyclops. 

I can hardly write anything about the fishes inhabiting the rivers and 
lakes. It will be better to postpone this topic until next year, and I 
shall limit myself to a mere enumeration of the species observed by me 
up to date, viz, Gasterosteus pungitius L., and G. cataphractas (Pall.), 
Salmo callarias (Pall.), (called Goletz by the natives here), Oncorhynchus 
lyeaodon (Pall.), (Russian, Krasnaja Biba), 0. sanguinolentus (Pall.),(Rus- 
sian, Kisuteh) y 0.proteu8 (Pall.), (llus$ian,Gorbuscha), and the il Bajdarsik n 
of the natives, which I have not yet been able to make out. " SiJc n is 
the Russian name of Coregonus, but I do not believe that it belongs 
to that genus, as the mouth extends beyond the eye. Probably it is 
the same species called Coregonus by Nordenskjold (Vega Expedition, 
American edition, page G18), as I do not know any other one to which 
to refer this name; the three other species of which he speaks are calla- 
rias, lyeaodon, and proteus. 

In my next report I hope to be able to add another Salmonoid to the 
list of the species known (as I suspect the occurrence of such a one). 

Batrachians and reptiles are wanting altogether on the island, as 
might be expected. Dr. Dybowski and I have been searching very 
eagerly for a SalamandrUla, as we suspected the " Kragani," of which 
the natives told us, to be such an animal. It turned out, however, to be 
a large Dytiscus. 

The ornithologist starting for Bering Island will probably prepare 
himself beforehand for hunting and collecting two large, rare, and inter- 
esting birds, viz, Thalassaetus pelagicus (Pall.) and Phalacrocorax perspi- 
cillatus Pall., as Pallas, on Steller's authority, gives Bering Island as 
their proper habitat, where they occurred in abundance. You will not 
be more disappointed than I am in learning that there is no hope what- 
ever of getting a specimen of the latter, and very little of obtaining 
any of the former from Bering Island. 

It is not to be doubted that the Phalacrocorax perspicillatus does not 
occur on the islands at present. The natives, however, remember very 
well the time when it was plentiful on the rocks, especially on the out- 
lying islet Are Kamen. About thirty years ago, they say, the last ones 
were seen, and the reason they give why this bird has become extermi- 
nated here on the island is that it was killed in great numbers for food. 
They unanimously assert that it has not been seen since, and they only 
laughed when I offered a very high reward for a specimen. 

When Pallas gives Bering Island as the habitatoi'the Thalassaetus I feel 
tolerably sure that he has misunderstood Steller's words, or that Steller, 
if he really has reported its occurrence, met with only a straggler from 
Proc. Nat. Mus. 83 5

Kaintschatka. The former supposition seems to me to be more probable, 
for the reason that Steller, in his description of Bering Island, does not 
mention this eagle.* He, however, speaks of an eagle in the following 
terms : " Von seltneru, an der sibirischen Kiiste nicht geseheueu Vogeln 
habe ich dort [Bering Isld] einen besondern Seeadler mit weissem Kopf 
und Schwanz . * * * augetroffen * * * jener nistet auf den 
hochsten Felsen, und sie baben im Anfang des Junius Junge, die ganz 
mit weisser Wolle bedeckt sind." This is the same bird of which he 
speaks in his " Beschreibung von dem Lande Kaintschatka " (1774), pp. 
193-194, as follows : " Eine Art unbekannter und sehr schoner Adler, 
so aber in Kaintschatka viel seltsamer vorkommen als in America und 
den Inseln im Canal, dahero auch solcbe bis diese Stunde noch nicht 
erhalten konnen. Es ist derselbe so gross als der Kaliatus, ganz 
schwarz, ausgenommen den Kopf, Uropygium, schwarze Fiisset und 
Schenkel, welche so weiss als Schnee sind. Er macht sein Nest auf 
hohen Felsen, aus Beisern im Diameter von einen Faden einen Schuh 
dicke und legt seine Eyer gegen den Anfang des Junii, zwey an der 
Zahl. Die Jungen sind ganz weiss, ohne einige Flecken ; und stiesen die 
beyde Eltern, da ich auf Barings Eilande das Nest besahe, dergestalt 
auf mich zu, dass ich mich kaurn ihrer mit dem Stock erwehren konnte. 
Ohnerachtet ich den Pullo keinen Schaden zugefiiget, verliesen die Alten 
dennoch das Nest und baueten sich ein anderes an einen Felsen wohin 
niemand moglich zu kommen." 

I think there can be little doubt that the bird thus described is a 
Halkcetus leucocephalus (Linn.) in spite of the white "thighs," which 
perhaps is only a lapsus Qalami of the person copying the original man- 
uscript, this being, as we know, only a rough draught of Steller's, in 
common with the "black feet." The following are my special reasons: 
1. The habitat given by Steller agrees exactly with that of II. leucoceph- 
alus, while T. pelagicus is common in Kamtschatka, and does not occur 
at all in America; 2. " AVhite head" can only be said about leucoceph- 
alus and not of pelagicus, which has merely the forehead white ; 3. If 
Steller had intended to describe the pelagicus he would not have over- 
looked the white shoulders, a much more couspicuous feature than the 
white forehead; 4. Even if Steller's manuscript contained the words 
"thighs white " it would be of little importance, as it seems that he did 
not kill the bird and only made the description from the living animal. 
In pelagicus the whole abdomen is white. The supposition here advanced 
seems the more plausible, as a pair certainly belonging to this species 
still breeds in the neighborhood of the place where Steller and his com- 
rades wintered. Besides, T. pelagicus inhabits exclusively the dense 
and large forests, and is not known to rear its young ones in such tree- 
less localities as those of Bering Island. When it occurs here, it is, at

tThis is completely senseless. I conjecture it to be a misprint for " Sckwanz-

present at least, only as a lonely straggler from Kanitschatka, usually 
a young bird, and there is no reason why this should have been differ- 
ent during Steller's time. I have seen such a young bird here, shot on 
the island, obtained by Mr. Grebnitzky, and forwarded by him to the 
Academy in St. Petersburg. It was in the same plumage as the young 
specimen in the National Museum. The measurements are as follows: 
Total length 910 mn] ; chord of culmen from forehead to tip. 85 mm , from 
cere to tip GS mra ; radius of curvature of culmen from cere to tip 41; 
bill from tip to mouth 84, to hind angle of nostrils G2, and from this 
point to fore angle of eye 40 mm ; height of upper mandible at upper bor- 
der of cere 37, and its breadth at the lower border of cere 27 mm ; gouys, 
29; wing, 030; tail feathers, 340 mm ; from feathering on front of tarsus 
to base of middle claw 142 ; chord of the latter 34, and of its hind claw 

AJjnm 

It will be seen from the above statement that the bald eagle is an in- 
habitant of the island, but I can affirm that it is very scarce at present 
in proportion to what it must have been only a few years ago, judging 
from the many abandoned nests and from reports of the residents. 

But it seems as if a third species of sea eagles should be added, not 
only to the fauna here, but even to the list of known birds, for I have 
never seen a young Halkcetus with the whole lower surface almost white, 
and the upper side with dark tips and edgings on a whitish bottom, such 
as my No. 1055. This, a young ? , still with black tail, was shot on the 
15th of May, measuring in total length 890 mm (35 inches), with a stretch 
of wings of 2.220 m (87.40 inches); iris, faint yellowish white; bill, horny 
brown; cere, yellow with horny brown shadings on the back; feet, 
bright golden yellow. 

Compared with the young of H. leucocephalus of the same age, it has, 
quite in contrast with the white color of the body, the tail feathers, 
under tail-coverts, and axillaries still darker colored. The size is not 
inconsiderably less than that of the bald eagle, as the specimen in ques- 
tion represents the largest size of its kind, being not larger than an old 
male of the said species. The bill is fully equal in size to that of a young 
leucocephalus, and the feet likewise; but the body, tail, and wings are 
smaller. 

I have little doubt that this bird if more mature would have assumed 
an almost uniform white plumage below, with white tail, a supposition 
corroborated by the statement of Mr. Grebnitzky, that he himself once 
has observed here, on the island, an eagle with a white lower surface 
and tail. 

That we do not deal in our case with an albino is evident not only 
from the color of the eyes, but the character of the whole plumage would 
also contradict such a theory. The white color does not appear as an 
irregularity, and the dark colors are deep and distinct. 

Upon the whole, I reach the conclusion that the present bird is suffi- 
ciently distinct from II. leucocephalus, and, consequently, also from H.

albicilla (L.). There are two other species, however, of which I know 
only the names, viz, H. leucoryphus (Pall.) and H. leucogaster (Gin.); but 
Dr. Dybowski, who is well acquainted with the former, asserts that this 
is quite a different bird, while Dr. Henry Guillemard, who has been 
collecting in Central Africa and is quite familiar with the latter, corrob- 
orated the same statement upon seeing my bird during- a day's visit 
here. Both received the impression that the species is a new one. 

Did I not have the hope tbat Mr. Eidgway would take the trouble to 
compare this specimen with those in the National Museum, and describe 
it if he should come to the same conclusion, I should not hesitate to 
give it a name. But as the collection of birds will be placed in such 
good hands as bis, I think it advisable to wait for his decision. 

In this connection I will merely mention some other forms which I 
suspect to have been hitherto more or less unknown, or wrongly known, 
likewise leaving to Mr. Eidgway the labor of having them compared, 
described, and named if he should find them to be actually new. 

In the first place I call your attention to the four larks, Nos. 1020 and 
1117 from Bering Island, and 1242 and 1249 from Petropaulski, where 
I found this species, in one place at least, tolerably common. The 
lengths are respectively, 186, 187, 183, and 173 ,um ; iris, dark brown; 
bill, pale flesh color; culmen and tips of both mandibles, blackish brown; 
feet, light reddish brown; tarsal joint, dark grayish; toes below, livid ; 
nails, blackish gray. It is much like the common European Alaiida 
arvensis L., but it appears to me to have lighter and clearer colors. The 
size agrees very well with that of birds from Northern Europe. 

No. 1251 is another passerine bird, thought to be new. It is a kind 
of willow-warbler, common in Petropaulski, but not observed here on 
the islands. My only specimen is a male, shot on the 5th of July, 1882. 
Total length, 149 mm ; iris, hazel; feet, clear yellowish brown. 

The loud song, consisting of the syllables ipitshe-icitshe-icit.shewitsh, 
and somewhat resembling the sound made by whetting a scythe, was 
heard, especially towards night, from all sides when walking through 
the high grass and willows covering the swampy slopes of the mount- 
ains with a thicket almost impenetrable both to foot and eye. You 
would very seldom get a glimpse of the watchful songster, when, cling- 
ing to the middle of the upright stalk of some high orchid or grass, he 
did his best in the singing-match with one of his own kind or a Calliope 
l-amtschatkensis or a Carpodacus. But no sooner would you move your 
gun to secure the longed-for specimen than he silently disappears, as 
completely and suddenly as if he possessed Dr. Fortuuatus's cap. The 
only way to obtain a specimen is to watch patiently near one of his 
favorite bushes, with the gun ready. For hours I have thus sat in 
the wet swamp, almost desperate from the bites of the numberless 
bloodthirsty mosquitos, which I did not dare to wipe off, fearing to drive 
away the silent bird, who perhaps was watching my immovable figure 
until he was satisfied as to his safety. Curious, but still cautious, he

would come nearer, slipping between the stems and branches nearest 
to the ground, uttering a very low, thrush-like tak; tak; talc; tak, and 
with the tail straight upright, very much like a long-tailed Troglodytes 
both in color and conduct. And if I kept absolutely quiet he sometimes 
would proceed close to my feet, looking curiously at me with his pretty 
dark eyes. But before the challenge of a neighbor had attracted his 
attention and provoked his reply, which he usually began with a short 
trill, it would not have been advisable to move a muscle. 

Then comes the time to lift your gun very slowly, stopping as often 
as he suspiciously stops his song, until the "crack" puts an end to it 
forever, and you hold in your hand a crushed specimen, unfit for prepa- 
ration, when you have to shoot from too short a distance, or return 
without anything, while, after a longer shot, you cannot find the plain- 
looking little bird amidst the immense vegetation in the dim light of 
the vanishing day and tortured by the intolerable mosquitos. You will 
understand from your own rich experience how much pleasure it gave 
me when I, at last, obtained a tolerably good specimen. Should it prove 
to be a valid species, I would be obliged if the name of its first discov- 
erer, Dybowski, be affixed to it. 

The family of sand-pipers is very well represented here on the island, 
and my collection therefore contains not less than nineteen species, 
or nearer one-third than one-fourth of the total number of species col- 
lected, a number liable to be not inconsiderably increased before the 
list embraces all the species occurring here as residents or visitors. I 
must confess that there are several species among my birds which I 
have not been able to identify, although I have no hope that all these 
will prove to be new. Thus the most common limicoline bird here is an 
Arquatella (Nos. 1031,1039, 1044, 1048, 1085, 1107, 1108, 1262, 1344, 1345, 
14G8, etc.), about which I feel quite sure that it is a very well known 
species, but as to these birds it is more difficult to determine the species 
from memory alone than in almost any other group that I know of. 

But there are in my collection two species, the common forms of which 
I have been well acquainted with, showing some differences from these, 
if I am not quite mistaken. The one is the snipe, which, having only 
fourteen tail-feathers, comes nearer to the European Gallinago gralUnaria 
(Mull.) than to the American G. wilsonii (Temra.). But I do not think 
that the former has the crissuin and the under tail-coverts so dark 
brownish as my specimens, nor is the pattern of their greater wing- 
coverts quite identical. Snipe-hunting without a dog is exceedingly 
difficult here. For this reason I have at present only five specimens to 
send of this bird, which, in suitable localities, is by no means uncommon. 

The other one is a form of Pelidna alpina, which seems remarkable 
for its pure colors and the absence of any dark spot on the lores. I 
cannot unite it with P. chinensis Swinh., which has been identified 
by Taczanowski with P. sehinzii (Brm.), and consequently must be much 
smaller than my birds. 



70 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Finally, I have referred five birds (Nos. 1637, 1641, 1646, 1652, and 
1659), with much doubt, to the genus Tringites Cab., on account of the 
very short bill, this being considerably shorter than the head, and the 
long toes exceeding the tail by their whole length when stretched back- 
wards. The feathering of the bill seems to me likewise to be more pro- 
tracted than in other Tringhuc, although not to such a degree as given 
for the American T. rvfescens (Vieill.). Besides, there are no black mot- 
tlings on a white ground on the wing, only some faint whitish mottlings 
at the base of the remiges as it is often seen in Tringce. A conspicuous 
feature is the fine black bristles before and below the eyes, almost 
encircling them, and, upon the whole, more developed than in other 
genera. The color, except the rusty crown, is to a certain degree like 
the plumage of the snipe, and the bill, being somewhat widened, grooved, 
and furrowed at the tips, and having a very long nasal groove, also re- 
motely resembles that of the bird mentioned. 

The total number of species collected during these months amounts 
to sixty-one, without counting those collected in Petropaulski 5 and, 
besides these, I have observed about ten species of which no specimens 
have yet been secured. Among the latter is Sterna longipennis Temm., 
of which a specimen was shot during my stay in Petropaulski, but on 
my arrival I found it in such a state of decomposition that it was quite 
impossible to preserve it. This species bred on the island, but only in 
four pairs. I looked in vain for your Sterna aleutica. Upon the whole, 
the poverty of representatives of the subfamilies Sterninw and La ri na' 
is very noticeable ; thus, for instance, I have met with only one species 
of the genus Larus, L. glaucescens, Licht., being not so numerous, how- 
ever, as one might expect.* 

Of the seventy or more species obtained or observed here during the 
four months (of which one was spent on the trips to Petropaulski) from 
the middle of May to the middle of September, about one-third consists 
of circumpolar birds, one-third Pacific birds, while the remaining third 
is pahearctic, or consists of East Asiatic forms. Only a few species can 
be regarded as American, viz, Halkcetus leucocephalus (L.), also occur- 
ring in Kamtschatka, and a BrantaJ which I have provisionally iden- 
tified as leucopareia (Brandt). During my absence in Kamtschatka a 

specimen was shot in the neighborhood of the village, and eaten! 

Fortunately, however, the head and upper part of the neck had been 

* The species of Larus observed on Toporkof Island by Dr. Kjellman and Dr. Stux- 
berg belongs here. From the translation of a portion of Professor Nordenshjold's nar- 
rative of the Vega expedition in Henry Elliott's monograph of the Seal Islands, p. 113, 
it would seem as if they also had found this bird there " by the millions." The Amer- 
ican edition by Leslie, p. (J17, shows, however, that they expressly restrict this state- 
ment to Frateroula cirrhata in accordance with fact. 

tSundevall (Tent. metb. disp. Av., p. 145, 1872) has substituted for Bran ta Scop. 
Braithus " Antiq.," a name accepted by some later authors, for instance Dr. Richenow 
(Orn. Centralbl., 1882, p. 36), but Brenthus is preoccupied for a genus of Coleoptera since 
1820. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 71 

cut off for my inspection, and with some difficulty I succeeded in skin- 
ning and preserving it. Besides the six downy young ones, a specimen 
was captured alive, and I hope to keep it safe from the numberless 
(about COO) old dogs of the village until it has assumed its full plumage. 
Whether the Anorthura belongs to alascensis Baird, or to fumigatus 
Temm., or whether these two are identical is beyond my present knowl- 
edge. On the other hand, I am very doubtful as to the groups to which 
Hierofalco candicans (Gm.) belongs. Acanthis exilipes (Coues) I regard 
as circumpolar, as I think it hardly practicable to separate the palse- 
arctic form from the American one. 

It is not my intention to give at present any list of the birds, but 
merely a brief enumeration of the more interesting species of the old 
world not mentioned above : 

FringUla montifringilla L. 

Leucosticte brunneinucha (Brdt.). 

Euspiza aureola (Pall.). 

Anthus sp. 

MotacUla kamtschatica "Pall." (Auct.).* 

Phyllopncmte borealis Bias. 
Cuculus canorinus Cab. — I have one specimen from Petropaulski, one 
from Copper Island, and one from Bering Island. In the former the 
stomach was filled with the remains of Bombus, in the latter two with 
a plenty of Gammaridoe! The cry is exactly like that of the European 
species. 

Charadrius fulvus Gm. 

Eudromias mongolicus (Pall.). 

JEgialitis alexandrinus (L.). 

Totanus glareola (L.). 

Totanus nebularius (Gurm.). 

Tringoides hypoleucos (L.). 

Actodromas temminckil (Leisl.). 

Actodromas damacensis (Iforsf.). 

Actodromas subtninutus (Midd.). 

Nettion falcatwm (Pall.). 



"'This form is usually quoted as M. alba var. kamtschatica Pall., Zoogr. Ross.-As., 
but I recollect very well that Pallas (op. cit.) does uot give such a name. It has 
usually been identified with Motacilla japonica Swinh. (=M. 7«</ensTemm. efr Schleg., 
Faun. Jap.), hut until we have learned whether the "black cheeks" of the latter is a 
mistake or not, I think it will be safest to keep the Ka i tschadalian bird separate 
under the above name, as its cheeks tire white with only a well-defined black stripe 
through the eye. The specimen from Petropaulski proves the identity of the birds 
here from the island with those of Kamtschatka, I now think that the birds in the 
National Museum, collected in Siberia by Mr. W. H. Dall and Dr. Bean," as also the 
specimen seen by Mr. Turner on Attn and the bird from California, all referred to M. 
ocularis Swinh., belong rather to M. kamlschatUa, being young, or in winter plumage, 
with gray back. M. ocularis seems to be an inland bird, not at all occurring ou the 
Pacific coast. 



72 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 

Of course the relations of the constituents of the ornis, as given above, 
are based only on a rough judgment, but it is thought that the zoogeo- 
graphical affinities of the islands are tolerably well expressed. It is to 
be expected that the additions which the fauna is likely to receive daring 
the following eight months will raise the percentage of the circnm polar 
birds. 

The ornis, however, is characterized not only by what it possesses 
but also by what it lacks. Thus I had expected to iind Saxicola 
cenanthe (L.) and Budytes flava (L.) (in Petropaulski I found the latter 
breeding, being more like the typical form than any other I have seen) 
and an Otocoris, to which the frequent sand-dunes offer favorite breeding 
places, one or two Siberian true Emberiza and Schceniclas, Chelidon 
erythrogaster (Bodd.)* (abundant in Petropaulski), and an Archibuteo. 
The orders Herodii and AJectorides are wanting altogether, and the re- 
markable poverty of the Laridcc- I have already mentioned. 

As a matter of course, my time was wholly occupied in collecting and 
preserving specimens of every branch of natural history, studying the 
rookeries, and taking meteorological observations. I had scarcely any 
opportunity for special ornithological studies. 

Some observations, however, relating to the seasonal change of plumage 
of the ptarmigan occurring here (Lagopas dibits Gm.) may perhaps be 
of some interest, as it forms a question involving the most contrary 
opinions among observers. Want of time will not allow any revision of 
the matter at present. For this reason I give the observations as they 
were written in my journal with the fresh birds before me. 

With regard to No. 1342, a $ shot July 29, 1882, 1 find the following 
notes : The feathers on head, breast, and abdomen are old ; that is to say, 
they are without any trace of the " outer follicle," and thus are also 
all the single white feathers, found mixed here and there between the 
brown ones on the upper surface. Almost all the dark feathers have 
their bases more or less concealed in the sheaths, and between these 
protrude still "unblown" sheaths with brown terminal pencils — in short, 
brown feathers in all stages of growth. The few dark feathers, also, on 
the hypochondries, some of which have white terminal spots, show the 
same phases. None of the white feathers are new. Betweeu the white 
ones on the breast some sheaths are seen protruding, but still without end 
pencils, showing themselves, however, to be dark ones, when opened. 

Another $ shot about fourteen days later (August 10, No. 1419) shows 
exactly the same conditions, only that the new dark feathers on the 
lower parts among the white ones are more developed, being blackish 
with white terminal spots.

the sternum, the inner sides of the femora, and the fore part of the ab-

doinen absolutely naked, has the feathers inore uniformly developed, as 
most of the dark ones are fully grown out, only a few on the interscap- 
uluin being still partly in the sheaths. Besides, two or three new, 
yellowish -colored feathers protrude from the naked parts. 

During my boat expedition around Bering Island in the latter part of 
August, I procured several males, two of which, being the most interest- 
ing ones, were prepared. Unfortunately, the bad weather almost spoiled 
them afterwards. (Nos. 1487 and 1480.) The following remarks are an 
extract from my journal of August 23 : The summer plumage is now 
wholly developed in all specimens, as the dark or rather black feathers 
of breast and abdomen are out too. Some few dark ones, however, are 
still in their sheaths, this being especially the case in the aforesaid parts 
of No. 1487. But the white feathers are in progress on the same parts 
too, being, especially in No. 1489, developed to such a degree that the 
breast and abdomen are white already in the middle from the half 
" blown " new white feathers. In No. 1487 new black and white feathers 
occur on the same parts and in the same state of development. Con- 
sequently it follows that the moulting of the winter plumage does not 
extend beyond the breast and abdomen; these parts for a short time 
assuming black feathers, while at the same time the new white feathers 
of the coming winter plumage maketkeir eruption on the same parts, and 
that the change of the summer plumage first begius where it had last 
been assumed. The same remarks are applicable to the wing coverts, 
with the modification that the greater part of these is white through 
the whole year, the new and the old white feathers staying side by side 
in my specimens. In the latter the inner wing feathers are new, while 
the three outermost primaries still remain from the foregoing year. The 
shafts of the new primaries are dark gray, this color being faded and 
almost invisible on the old ones. 

The specimens show a very marked difference in color of the upper 
surface. No. 1489 has the upper parts darker, less rusty, and the feath- 
ers less distinctly banded, thus assuming a more irregular and more 
minutely watered aspect. It must be remarked, however, that in No. 
14S7 the few feathers still undeveloped, are of a darker color and of a 
pattern more like those of No. 1489 than the more rusty colored feathers 
of the remaining upper plumage. But these feathers are so few in 
number that I feel satisfied that this specimen at least would not have 
assumed any new plumage before the final change into the white winter 
plumage. The dark specimen has also some new and " unblown " feath- 
ers among the old ones on exactly the same parts as No. 1487. From 
this I feel very much inclined to believe that the difference is caused 
by age, and I doubt at present very much the idea of Professor Lillje- 
borg that the darker plumage signifies a special autumnal plumage. It 
seems to me that we may reasonably conclude that Lagopus alius in this 
region is subject to an uninterrupted change from the moment when the 
first dark feathers make their appearance in spring until the last one

lias disappeared in fall, and that no marked seasonal plumage can be 
distinguished, except the white plumage of the winter and the dark 
one of the summer. 

But it will be well to recollect here that the moulting of these birds de- 
pends so much upon the climate that one can hardly conclude from obser- 
vations made in one country what the condition in another is. The 
many unpleasant quarrels about this theme have arisen from want of 
understanding the fact that it does not follow that an observation made 
in the north is erroneous because it differs from another made in the 
south, or vice versa. 

I must confess, however, that the theory of a change of color from 
winter to summer plumage, without change of feathers, and the obser- 
vations upon which it rests, is an insolvable problem to me. 

The past four months form a season during which I had very little 
opportunity for observing or collecting cetaceans, and consequently I 
have but little to report about them. It is, however, to be expected that 
the fall and winter will prove richer, and that I may be able to satisfy 
you better in this repect next year. But as the natives have no means 
of capturing the living animals, I shall have to depend exclusively upon 
what may occasionally be cast on shore. 

The female finback whale which we found during our boat expedition 
at Lissonkavaja Buchta, on the 23d of August, seems to me to belong 
to Balcenoptera velifera Cope, agreeing tolerably well with it in dimen- 
sions and proportions, of which I give a table below. The baleen, of 
which I have secured some pieces (No. 1629) for comparison with speci- 
mens of the above-named species in the National Museum, has on the 
shorter layers a whitish color, with dark bluish-gray longitudinal and 
parallel stripes. These stripes increase in breadth, number, and dark- 
ness of color towards the longest baleen, which is dark bluish-gray 
with light stripes. 

The base of the dorsal fin commences about at the terminal third of 
the body, and is placed almost directly above the anus. Its height — that 
is, the vertical from its tip to the back — is about -^ of the total length of 
the body, which is about 6J times the length of the pectorals. 

From this it will be seen that the exterior proportions are somewhat 
similar to those of Sibbaldius laticeps Gray, except that the pectorals are 
smaller in the latter species. 

The dorsal fin is perfectly falcate with deeply incised posterior edge, 
showing that the animal does not belong to the var. borealis. 

The color could not be ascertained, as the animal had been lying so 
long on the beach that it was perfectly yellowish white with the excep- 
tion of some blackish patches on the shoulder region. 

The impossibility of moving or lifting the colossal body prevented me 
from taking measurements in a straight line. For the same reason I 
could not obtain any measurement of the circumference. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 75 

The average breadth of the pectoral folds I found to be 80 mm (3.15 
inch.), and that of the eminences between them about 50 mm (1.97 inch.) 

In spite of a minute search for parasitic animals, none could be de- 
tected.

Besides this larger kind of whale, several denticetes occur in the 
waters around the islands, but, as the natives do not hunt them, they 
are captured only when they are cast ashore, which does not happen 
very often. Thus a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalusf) was cast on 
shore some years ago, yielding a rich harvest of oil and blubber. Be- 
sides an Orca, which is said to visit the rookeries, but of which I have 
not been able to procure any specimen, or even to see one, there are at 
least two species of the family Ziphiidw, both undescribed, as I suppose. 
I am very much indebted to Mr. Grebnitzky for a skull of each of the 
species, for one of which I should like to propose the name Berardius 
bairdii, as a slight token of my esteem and gratitude. 

As I am now almost without any literary means, I find it impossible 
to decide with certainty in what genus this species will finally have to 
be placed. But I think that the supposition that this specimen (No. 
1520) is a young Berardiun may not be very far out of the way. At 
first I suspected that it is a Bioplodon, but the size of the skull, in con- 
nection with the distinctness of the sutures, the evident maxillary crests, 
and the terminal position of the teeth, very soon led me to the above 
conclusion. 



76 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



The specimen in question has very low and scarcely incurved maxil- 
lary crests; the shortest distance of which is two and two-thirds times 
greater than their greatest height, and although it still is in its " adoles- 
cent 1 ' stage, I should greatly doubt whether the crests in this species 
ever become developed to such a degree as, for instance, in Hyperoodon 
diodon (Lacep.). The groove between the maxillary and the nuchal crest 
is very shallow. The maxillary notch is deep. The beak is long, making 
only a little less than half the length of the entire skull. Nares straight; 
right nasal larger than the left one, but not very much. The occipital 
condyles do not come in contact beneath the foramen magnum ; the sym- 
physis of the lower jaw is very short, amounting to only one-fifth of the 
whole length of the jaw. 

Want of time and books prevents me from making more extended 
remarks, and until I can present an exhaustive and comparative descrip- 
tion, I shall have to content myself by giving a provisional table of 
dimensions. The following dimensions are in millimeters and English 
inches, and are in every case measured in a straight line :

This specimen was found stranded in Stare Gavan, on the eastern 
shore of Bering Island in the fall of last year, and only the skull was 
preserved. From analogy I should judge that the entire length of the 
animal must have been about 18 feet (5£ meters). This species is well 
known by the natives for the cathartic quality of the blubber, resem- 
bling in this respect the Atlantic " Dogling," or "Anarnak" {Hyperoodon 
diodon). The Russian name, by which the inhabitants here designate 
this whale, is Pla-un (sp. Pliioon), while the Aleut name is Kigan aga- 
lusoch, the meaning of which is said to be " having teeth on the nose," 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 77 

a very inappropriate designation, as the teeth are situated on the tip of 
the lower jaw, and not on the nose. 

The second species, founded on my No. 1521, seems to belong to the 
Cuvierian genus Zij)hius, having for its type Z. cavirostrh Cuv., and 
more especially to the group (Petrorhynchus Gray) which is character- 
ized by having the nasals, in connection with the premaxillaries, formed 
to a vaulted roof over the nares, and the ethmoidal cartilage ossified 
and extending above the premaxillaries in the anterior part of the beak. 

I take great pleasure in dedicating this interesting species to its dis- 
coverer, the obliging governor of the Commander Islands, Mr. Nicolaj 
Grebnitzky, to whom science is indebted for these and many other con- 
tributions, and myself for so much courtesy. I propose to name it 
Ziph ins grebmtzlai. 

That the typical specimen is an old animal is evident from the fusion 
of the bones and the indistinctness of the sutures, thus making it some- 
what difficult to distinguish the individual bones. 

After my return from here I shall give a more complete description 
and figures ; but in the mean time the following characters may serve 
for the identification of the species, as I consider most of them diagnostic : 

The tip of the beak is obtuse, with a vertical furrow in the middle, 
the lower jaw with the two terminal teeth protruding considerably be- 
yond the upper one. From about the middle of the beak towards the 
tip the mesethmoidal, ossified in its whole length, arises, like a rounded 
staff, between and above the premaxillaries, following these to the tip 
and being totally fused together with them. The nasal groove is very 
unsymmetrical, owing to a very prominent asymmetry of the premaxil- 
laries and the nasals, so that the direction of the oblique nares forms 
an angle of not less than 20 degrees with the vertical plane through 
the longitudinal axis of the skull. The right os nasale and the pre- 
maxilla of the same side are by far the larger ones, and form the prin- 
cipal part of the roof above the nares, the nasal not reaching, however, 
so far forward as the premaxilla. The antenasal groove is large, and 
in the anterior half partly vaulted over by the edges of the premaxil- 
laries, which are somewhat bent inwards. 

The zygomatic process of the squamosals touches the orbital process 
of the frontals without coalescing, however. The jugale is not nar- 
rower in the fore part, which, consequently, is not dilated and does not 
reach the posterior maxillary notch. This is not particularly deep, and 
the anterior one is still more shallow. The visible part of the vomer is 
loug and narrow, commencing 124" 11 " (4.S8 inches) from the tip of the 
beak. The supraoccipital is rather inclined forwards, forming an angle 
of about 40 o with a line parallel to the vertical axis of the skull. 

The following table of dimensions contains the more important meas- 
urements in millimeters and English inches :

It will be seen that the symphysis of the lower jaw is comparatively 
short, making only about one-fifth of the entire length of the jaw. 

The species occurs here on the island, and my specimen was obtained 
in the same way as the one previously mentioned. 

The natives employ the same names for both, considering them to be- 
long to the same kind. The same defect which makes the Berarclias 
bairdii unfit for food for men and dogs is also ascribed to Grebnitzky's 
Small-headed Whale. That these two whales should be confounded is 
not so strange, however, when we come to consider that the total length 
of the two animals, in spite of the much smaller skull of the latter, is 
nearly the same ; for in the same manner as I judged the former to have 
a length of about 18 feet, I estimate the present old specimen to have . 
been about 20 feet (64 meters) long, a length which the adult of Baird's 
beaked whale will probably also reach. 

The most interesting objects in the natural history of these islands 
are unquestionably the remains of the extinct northern sea-cow (Ry- 
tina* fjigas (Zimm.) 1780 1 = Rhy Una stelleri (Fischer) 1814, and at 
present the success of the collecting naturalist here depends more or 
less upon the harvest of bones of this animal which he may be able to 
send home. 

As to my own results in this respect, I shall give you a separate, de- 
tailed report, from which you may learn the peculiar difficulties con- 
nected with this part of my operations, and the account of the " circum- 

*Tho original spelling of IUiger, 1811.

navigation" of Bering: Island will show you likewise'some of the ways 
in which these skeletons are deposited, preserved, and found. 

At this place I shall present only a lew remarks, occasioned by the 
inspection of the 11 skulls which I have obtained, and the two belong- 
ing to Dr. B. Dybowski, now in Petropaulski. 

It is obvious at first sight, when comparing this series, that a remark- 
able individual variation is shown by each one of these skulls. Setting 
aside the differences caused by the more or less perfect state of pres- 
ervation, these variations especially embrace the more or less marked 
developments of the lines, crests, protuberances, and processes for mus- 
cular insertion, and the more or less robust formation of special parts. 
Although the skulls are of about the same size, these differences, I 
think, are due to age, as it is very probable that these large animals 
must have reached an almost patriarchal age, and that the development 
of the bones in consequence hereof has been proportionally slow, con- 
tinuing even after the skull had obtained the full and final size. 

But, besides these individual variations, there is another striking dif- 
ference, which divides the series into two well-defined groups. Dr. 
Dybowski and I stood side by side, looking at several skulls before us, 
and I had no sooner perceived and showed to him this fact than he 
was impressed in the same manner. We now eagerly sought for con- 
firmation in the other skulls, and as we, by a careful examination, found 
a no less marked difference in the shape of the lower jaw, we brought 
together a tolerably good collection of these bones, commencing an ex- 
haustive series of measurements to serve as a foundation for and proof 
of our discovery.* I have given below two tables containing the more 
interesting of these measurements. 

The idea of two different species or varieties of the sea-cow was very 
soon rejected, and without much hesitation we agreed that the differ- 
ence is a sexual one. This seems to be the only reasonable solution, 
and, judging from analogy we think that the broader and more robust 
skull belongs to the male, while the narrower and more slender one is 
that of the female, a supposition corroborating the opinion of the natives, 
who also have been aware of the difference. Of this, however, we were 
not informed until much later, when we made inquiries about the mat- 
ter; but we could not learn whether this assumption is founded on tra- 
ditions from the time when these animals still occurred in the surround- 
ing waters or not. 

*I call it thus because I doubt whether a similar observation baa been published by 
any one before. This is, maybe, somewhat daring, considering our want of liter- 
ature, but I prefer to take this risk ratber than to wait until nest year, and perhaps 
come too late with " the discovery."

This table proves the fact that while the longitudinal dimensions are 
almost identical in the supposed two sexes, most of the transverse dimen- 
sions anterior to the occipital boue are much smaller in the female than 
in the male, the difference averaging- from 7 to 25 per cent, of the smaller 
dimension. 

The average measurements give a very clear representation of these 
relations, and they are therefore very serviceable in trying to express 
the difference in a diagnosis, because they eliminate the individual varia- 
tion.* 

* I recall here Humboldt's words : " Dass bei allem Beweglichen and Veriinderliclien 
ini Raume mittlere Zahlenwerthe der letzte Zweck, ja der Jusdruek physischer Gesetzc 
sind, welche uus das Stetige in deru Wechsel wis in der Ershcheinungeu zeigen."

It will thus be seen that in the supposed male, the length of the skull 
is less than twice the breadth at the zygomatic arch [653 <; 698 (2 x 
349)], while in the female the length is almost exactly two times the 
breadth (654 about = 656) (2 x 328), and this holds good, not only in 
the average measurements, but in every single instance: 

$ 676 < 706 (2 x 353) $ 655 about = 660 (2 x 330) 

$ 054 < 706 (2 x 353) $ 645 about = 648 (2 x 324) 

$ 636 < 684 (2 x 342) 5 662 = 662 (2 x 331) 

$ 672 < 720 (2 x 360) 
S 625 < 676 (2 x 338) 

We can also express the difference by comparing the length with 
another dimension, thus: In the male the total length is less than 10 
times the breadth of the intermaxilla at the anterior angle of the nasal 
aperture [653 < 710 (10 x 71)], while in the female the length is more 
than even 11 times the same breadth [654 > 638 (11 x 58)], the result 
being the same in each individual. 



$ 676 < 740 (10 x 74) 
$ 654 < 740 (10 x 74) 
$ 636 < 720 (10 x 72) 
$ 672 < 690 (10 x 69) 
$ 625 < 650 (10 x 65) 



$ 655 > 649 (11 x 59) 
9 645 > 627 (11 x 57) 
5 662 > 627 (11 x 57) 



I think that this will be sufficient at present to show that there exists 
a well-marked difference, which can be formulated as above. Besides, 
there are numerous points in which the two groups of skulls can be dis- 
tinguished, but which cannot be expressed in figures. Unfortunately I 
cannot give minute comparative descriptions, as the skulls are already 
packed and shipped. 

The same is the case with the lower jaws, of which I herewith give a 
table of dimensions.

* These jaws evidently do not belong to the skulls having the corresponding numbers on the forego- 
ing table, although they were brought to me together by the natives. As the skulls and mandibles are 
seldom found together, the natives choose the best-preserved mandible or the ono corresponding best 
as to color, the more as these bones are by no means scarce. This I had decided long before we had 
conjectured the difference of the sexes, and it will be seen that the remark is also applied to a specimen 
(No. 1056) in which the supposed sex in both parts agrees. 

As I have already remarked, it is very unusual to get a skull with its 
authentic mandible, for wliicli reason they in all cases ought to be 
looked upon with critical eyes. The only instance in which I am sure 
that the two parts belong together is my No. 1110, and as this specimen 
(in a very good state of preservation) has been regarded by us as the 
type of the male form, the lower jaws showing a different style are con- 
sequently considered to belong to the females. 

The differences between the two groups are perhaps more striking in 
the mandibles than in the other parts of the skull, although the in- 
dividual variations are very conspicuous too. In general the supposed 
female mandible is higher, with broader rami, higher symphysis, and 
more protracted posterior angles, which are bent inwardly towards 
each other, while in the male they are straight or somewhat turned out- 
ward. Thus the proportion between the distance of the two angles and 
the height of the vertical ramus is very different in the two sexes and 
may be formulated as follows : 

In the male the distance from the articular surface of the condyles to 
the posterior angle is less than twice the distance between the tips of 
the posterior angles, while the proportion is the reverse in the female. 
The words " articular surface of the condyles " can also be replaced by 
" coronoid process," only that the formula then must be altered so as to 
read, that the distance from the coronoid process to the posterior angle

83 



in the male is equal to or less than the distance between the angles, 
while it is greater in the female. 

How closely the posterior angles approximate to each other in the 
female as compared with the male, is clearly expressed by tbe average 
figures of this distance and of that between the condyles. While the 
difference between the figures of the latter only amounts to 11""" it 
is in the former distance, which is not more than about one-half of the 
other, not less than 4S ,mn or in other words : The difference between 
the average distances of the condyles amounts to about 5 per cent, of 
the smaller dimension, while the difference between the average dis- 
tances of the angles is 44 per cent. 

The average measurements furnish us with still more distinguishing 
marks. Thus, in the male the distance between the posterior angles is 
more than one-third of the total length of the horizontal ramus, while it 
amounts to almost exactly one-fourth in the female. Besides, the for- 
mer distance in the male is greater than the smallest breadth of the 
vertical ramus, while the reverse is true in the other sex. 

It may be well to give here the measurements of two other mandibles, 
which were not included in the above table, the one (No. 1202) a very 
young male, the dimensions of which would have diminished the aver- 
age measurements so as to obscure the results, while the other (No. 
1036), an adult female, was only found after the table had been coin- 
piled, when the other jaws were packed and shipped. 

The numbers of the dimensions correspond with those of the table 
above :

It is interesting to see how closely the dimensions of the female jaw 
approximate the average dimensions of the table, and consequently how 
well they agree with the diagnosis. In the young male the proportions 
are a little obscured, as the bone has not yet assumed its final shape. 
The characters of the male jaw, however, are pretty well marked. The 
outward direction of the posterior angle is especially characteristic. 

Concerning the year of the final extinction of the sea-cow I have little 
doubt that von Baer and Brandt, in supposing it to be 1768, are very 
nearly correct. That a single individual or two, perhaps, may have 
survived the others a few years is not impossible, but it is almost cer- 
tain that such a huge animal, bound to the very coast for its subsist- 
ence, hardly could have found a place in which to hide itself from the 
keen eyes of its pursuers, who were sufficiently numerous and greedy 
to search for and slay even the last one. Besides, the animal does not 
seem to have avoided its enemies, a want of intelligence which in a

short time must have been fatal to all. As to the story reported by 
Professor Nordenskjold (Vega Exped., Am, ed., p. GOO) about an ani- 
mal steu by two natives still living here, all the residents competent 
to form an opinion think that he has been deceived. After the inves- 
tigations made by myself I have little doubt that the natives are right. 
I And it proper, however, not to publish any details until I shall have 
returned to Washington. 

As to the geographical range of the sea-cow, I have only a few remarks 
to make. It can scarcely be doubted that it at least occasionally must 
have occurred on Copper Island. Besides, this is positively affirmed 
by Mr. Osche, who saw bones there (cfr. " Vega Exped."), an observa- 
tion, corroborating my own experience. When Professor Nordenskjold 
(op. tit., Amer. ed., p. 005) remarks that the sea-cow does not appear to 
have ever occurred on the Aleutian Islands his statement is contra- 
dictory to the information which my friend Lucien M. Turner has re- 
ceived from the natives on Attn.* It would be especially interesting to 
know whether the statement of the natives, " that a number of bones 
much heavier than other bones, or more like ivory in weight, are to be 
found on Semitkhi and Agattu," is true or not.t It is very difficult to see 
why they should not have occurred on the other Aleutian Islands, as the 
natural conditions there are the same as here on Bering Island, and the 
sea- weed, on which the sea-cow fed, is as plentiful there as it is here, or even 
more so (cfr. the statement of Wosnessenski in Ruprecht, " Tauge des 
Ochotsk Meeres," Midd. Sibir. Beise. I, 2 p. 202). On the other hand, 
the probability of their occurence, even occasionally, in the more north- 
ern parts of Bering Sea (Nordenskjold, op. tit., p. 591) seems to be very 
slight, owing to the scanty marine flora in these waters (Ruprecht, op. 
tit, p. 203). I have been informed that a certain Mr. Neumann has 
published in the Journal of the Geographical Society of Irkutzk an 
account that he had found bones of the sea-cow on the Chukch penin- 
sula, which bones are said to have been deposited in the museum at 
Irkutzk. Furtherinquiries proved, however, that the bones were bought 
by him here on Bering Island. Fortunately, they were destroyed by 
the great fire in the museum. 

* An account of which, I suppose, is now printed in his report. 

t Information which I have received from a man horn on Attu, hut now living here, 
confirms this statement to a certain degree. Of course, he knows the hones of the 
sea-cow very well, and he has told me that similar hones, also skulls, occurred on 
Agattu. But he expressly added, that they were smaller than the hones found here. 
Neither he, nor another man from Attn, who, besides, did not know anything ahout 
the occurrence of such hones on Agattu, nor any of the other Aleuts here, chiefly 
from Atkha, have ever heard the Aleutian name Kuhh-sukh-tukh, given hy Mr. Tur- 
ner. May, it, perhaps, have been a smaller kind ? Any one familiar with these hones 
will hardly confound them with bones of either seals or whales. The stories of the 
natives about living animals in the time of their fathers is probably not more to be 
depended upon than -the similar story which was told Professor Nordenskjold here 
on Bering Island. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 85 

Finally, a word about the Kamtschadalian uame " Kapustnik" and 
the conclusions which Professor Nordenskjold (loc. tit.) derives from it. 
Steller translated it with "Krautfresser," and JSTordenskjold thinks that 
this word is specially distinctive of a graminivorous animal. The Russian 
word "Kapiista" signifies cabbage, but here and in Kamtschatka, where 
cabbage has never been cultivated, it is the local term for just that kind 
of kelp on which the sea-cow fed. The contents of the stomachs of the 
stranded animals give a natural reason for the name, and no support 
for the supposition that the sea-cow ever visited the coasts of Kamts- 
chatka alive can fairly be derived from it. 

I cannot close the chapter on the sea-cow without adding a few words 
about the exterior form of the caudal fin, a question highly exciting 
the scientific world in Washington when I left in the spring. It will 
be remembered that Mr. Henry W. Elliott made a restoration of the 
animal, showing the shape of the tail like that of the southern manatee, 
in spite of the only authentic information on the subject handed down 
to us by G. W. Steller, the eminent and conscientious naturalist. Be- 
sides, there is an old drawing, reproduced by Middendorff and by Nor- 
denskjold, agreeing with and consequently corroborating the state- 
ment of Steller, likewise representing the whale-like shape of the fin. 
The statements which I have had the opportunity' to see (besides 
Brandt's Latin translation of Steller's words) are found in Neueste 
nord. Beitr. II, p. 292, " Typogr. Beschr. der Bering Insel," where he 
says : u Bis an den Nabel vergleicht sich dieses thier den Robbenarten, 
von da bis an den Schwanz einem Fisch" ; and in Krashenninicoff's 
" History of Kamtschatka," the English edition, 1764, 1 find the follow- 
ing words: "The tail is thick, and bent a little towards the end; it 
somewhat resembles the beard of the whale, and somewhat the fins of 
a fish. 

The sources of Krashenninicoff's notes about the sea-cow are, how- 
ever, only Steller's manuscripts, which were placed at his diposal (cfr. 
the preface, op. tit., p. vi). There is said to be a drawing in Pallas's 
" Icoues ad Topogr. Ross.- Asiat." (fasc. II), and reproduced in ISordensk- 
jold's "Vega Exped.," Am. ed., p. 607, pretending to be a sketch made 
by Steller himself, and showing a very bifurcated and lobated fin. 

I remember that the authenticity of this drawing was objected to on 
the ground that jSordenskjbld's statement of its having been given to 
Pallas by Steller evidently was false ; but Nordenskjold, loc. tit., only 
says : " Sketch by Steller, given to Pallas," which is not the same as 
"Sketch given to Pallas by Steller." That Steller had a sketch of the 
animal is evident from the words in his " Beschreibung von Kamts- 
chatka," 1774, where (p. 97) he says that he has " sehr weitlaiiftige Be- 
schreibuugeu verfertigt, und sie zugleich zeichuen lassen," and it is there- 
fore very probable that Pallas, who had ao many of Steller's manuscripts, 
also had the said drawing. While now all the direct information agrees 
on this point, it is a very memorable fact that we, if we had only had 



HG PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

the caudal vertebrae of the skeleton left, and no descriptions of the ex- 
terior shape of the tin at all, nevertheless would have been forced to 
restore it as a whale's tail. The large transverse processes of these 
vertebra' must have had a special function, namely, to support a tail 
having a fin like that of a whale or a dugong, which have the same 
kind of processes, and not like that of the manatee, which is destitute 
of them. By seeing these vertebra 1 , 1 feel now more convinced than 
over that there is no reason for supposing the old view, which even led 
to the specific name Manet i bahvnurus (1785), to have been incorrect. 
It has been said that "nature" is not so contradictory as to provide such 
a sluggish animal like the sea-cow with the tail of the swift whale, a 
thought as ridiculous as to imagine " a rhinoceros with the legs of a race- 
horse." But it is to be remarked: 1, that the swiftness does not depend 
upon the shape, but merely upon the relative size, and upon the strength 
of the moving muscles ; 2, that a careful study of Steller's words shows 
that it was not at all impossible for the sea-cow to move even very rap- 
idly ; and, 3, that "nature" would have been able to effect even extreme 
swiftness by a fin like that of the manatee, if it had been necessary, as 
it is a well-known fact that animals with legs as clumsy as those of a 
rhinoceros or an elephant are able to run as fast as a good horse. 

I think I hardly need apologize for passing the fur-seal (Callorhinus 
ursinus) and its allies in silence, until I have had further experience. 
There is nothing gained by making a few more or less insignificant re- 
marks on a matter about which an elaborate work has been published 
under your superintendence in this very year, especially as none of them 
are of such importance as to make a speedy publication desirable. On 
the whole, I am in a position to affirm most of Mr. Elliott's statements. 
But as a matter of course there must be some differences, caused partly 
by the local circumstances and partly by the fact that two observers 
do not always view the same thing in the same light. It is therefore 
evident that many of my final notes will take the form of more or less 
critical remarks on Mr. Elliott's monograph, an additional reason why 
I should wish to retain them until they have been subjected to a new 
and thorough test. 

But an erroneous statement of Professor Nordenskjold (Voy. Vega, 
Amer. ed., p. GOO), that the list given in the note (loc. tit.) only embraces 
the fur-seals killed on Bering Island, must be corrected at once, as from 
the wide distribution of his book it is likely to be repeated by others 
not £oini' back to the original source.* The following is an authentic 



"Evidently he has mid erst ood Elliott's list as concerning only Bering Island. In 
his monograph, p. 113, Mr. Elliott gives the same figures with regard to "the Com- 
mander Islands," but without correcting Nordeusjold's mistake. Tho list actually 
embraces the skins from Robben Island, too. (This island, or rather rock, is situated 
close to Saghaliii Island and doe.a not belong to the Kurile chain as stated by Elliott, 
p. 8 ) Besides, there is a slight typographical error in Elliott's figures, the total be, 
ing given as :587,4o'2 instead of :589,4b2.

I can account for the disagreement in Elliott's list concerning the 
year 1871 only by supposing that he gives the shipment, while the one 
above shows how many seals were actually killed every year. The 
skins taken in the fall are not shipped before the following year. 

Enhydra lutris (Linn.). 

Of this animal I have only to report the sad fact that it has been 
totally exterminated, or nearly so, on Bering Island. It sometimes 
happens that a single animal is killed on shore opposite Copper Island, 
where they still occur in numbers, and I myself was so lucky as to 
observe a sea-otter swmming along the coast on the same side. It was 
far off, and my ball missed it ; I had, however, a tolerably good oppor- 
tunity of observing its peculiar manner of swimming by means of a spy 
glass. The present scarcity of this animal on our island, where it has 
been so abundant, will be perceived from the fact that since 1871- only 
ten sea-otters have been captured. 

I do not wish to lengthen this already too protracted letter by giving 
details relating to the blue fox ( Vulpes lagopus Auct.), and I should 
perhaps let it pass without mentioning, were it not that Professor 
Nordenskjold has published a very erroneous statement, both as to its 
number and its color. He says (Voy. Vega, Amer. ed., p. 601): 
"Now they are so scarce that during our stay here we did not see one. 
Those that still survive, besides, as the European settled on the island 
informed me, do not wear the precious dark-blue dress formerly common, 
but the white, which is of little value. On the neighboring Copper 
Island, however, there are still dark-blue foxes in pretty large num- 
bers," and to this he in a foot-note makes the remark that "it thus 
appears as if the eager hunting had an influence not only on the number 
of the animals, but also on their color, the variety in greatest demand 
becoming also relatively less common than before." 

That the blue fox, however, is by no means uncommon on Bering 
Island will be perceived from the fact that a considerable number are 
killed and sent to San Francisco every year. Thus not less than 1,450 
skius were shipped this year (1882), besides 900 from Copper Island. 
The statement about the color is certainly founded upon a mistake too, 
for among all the 1,470 skins bought on Bering Island by the Alaska 
Company in the course of this year only 20 are "white" foxes, so that

it is this latter form which is very rare, both absolutely and relatively. 
Formerly they were more common, but about twenty or twenty-five 
years ago the old Russian Company resolved to pay more for the white 
ones than Tor the blue, and to have them killed all the year round 
without respect to the season, in order to destroy them and possibly 
have them exterminated. At present they are very scarce, and now 
the natives themselves pursue them eagerly, because they spoil the 
brood by mixing with the blue ones.* 

From the following list it will be seen that the number of foxes de- 
creases greatly when they are hunted for several successive years. It 
has therefore been agreed upon that the hunt be suspended for one or 
two years, with intervals according to circumstances, in order to give 
the animals time to fill the diminished ranks. This may perhaps be 
the cause of Kordenskj old's mistake. The fact is, that the fox hunting 
is a very important source of income to the natives on Bering Island.

I ought not to omit mentioning two other terrestrial mammals which 
offer a contribution to the history of the immigration of the fauna. The 
one is Mus miuculus L., the other Arvicola rutilus Pall. 

According to the assertion of the inhabitants, it is beyond any doubt 
that none of these animals occurred on Bering Island before 1870. 
Before that time they had not even seen a mouse, and many of them 
had never heard the name mentioned. In 1880 the " black mouse" 
(masculus) was brought from San Francisco by the schooner "Justus," 
with a cargo of flour. The "red mouse" (rutilus) made its appearance 
later, but as the natives were then already acquainted with that kind 
of animal, they did not pay sufficient attention to ascertain in what 
year the introduction actually took place. That it was introduced later 
than the common mouse is proved by the belief of the natives, who 
think that the red, short-tailed mouse is the offspring of the long-tailed, 
dark-colored animal. It finally turned wild by changing its more 
domesticated manner of life into the freer habits in the fields and moun- 



*On Copper Island white foxes do not appear at all. Besides, the bine ones are 
6aid to be larger, which is probably caused by a larger supply of food.

tains. They overlooked the fact, however, that both forms infest their 
houses and huts in equal numbers. 

It is very remarkable how enormously the number of this Arvicola 
has increased since its introduction. For in not more than ten years 
it 1ms spread all over the island from the utmost point in the north to 
its southernmost end. Now it is abundant in every locality, in the 
swamps and among the sand-dunes, on the flats, and in the mountains, 
in the interior, and everywhere along the beach. All the huts on the 
island inhabited by the fox-hunters during winter are occupied by them, 
and they become a veritable annoyance by eating and gnawing every- 
thing they can get at. I myself have been greatly troubled by them. My 
various collections seemed a special attraction to them, and many a nice 
specimen fell a victim to their destruction. It is almost incredible how 
they find their way to places thought to be absolutely " mouse-proof." 

None of these animals have yet reached Copper Island, but their 
introduction seems to be only a question of time. 

Whether the red field-mouse was introduced by ships or by birds of 
prey, or in any other way from Kamtschatka, cannot be decided. At 
all events, the introduction of these two animals took place much 
against the will of men. 

I finally wish to mention the introduction of another terrestrial mam- 
mal, which was imported with the intention of having it acclimatized 
for the use of the natives in the near future. It is the experiment of 
transferring tame reindeers (Rangifer tarandus L.) from Kamtschatka 
to Bering Island, where the rich pastures seem to justify the hope of 
success. 

Dr. Dybowski and the Alaska Commercial Company share the honor 
of this enterprise, he by taking the trouble of procuring the animals 
from the interior of Kamtschatka and taking care of their transporta- 
tion to Petropaulski ; the company, by bearing, with never- failing lib- 
erality, the heavy expenses of an undertaking which never can be of any 
direct benefit to them, but only to the natives of the island. 

Four males and eleven females were successfully transferred on board 
the company's steamer Alexander, where they fed on the fresh leaves 
of birch and willow procured in Petropaulski, much against the pre- 
dictions of experts. After the leaves were consumed, they even put 
up with hay, and were safely landed at Bering Island on the 15th of 
July, 1882. i)n shore they eagerly began to graze the fresh herbs, but 
within half an hour the whole herd was en route southward for the 
mountains. All fifteen have been seen very lately. The natives com- 
plain that they have eaten all the cloud berries (Rub its chamccmonts) 
and crake berries (Empetrum nigrum) in the neighborhood of the South- 
ern Rookery, a trifle, however, compared with the self-evident utility of 
the animal.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME BIRDS SCPPOSED TO BE CNDLSCRIRED, 
FROM THE (<HI.!lA>I>i::{ ISLANDS AND PETROPACLOVSKI, COL- 
LECTED BY DR. LEONIIARD STEJNEGER, V. S. SIGNAL SERVICE. 

By ROBERT KIDGWAY. 

The following apparently new species form part of a fine collection of 
birds from the Commander Islands and the vicinity of Petropanlovski, 
Karntschatka, lately received at the National Museum from Dr. Leon- 
hard Stejneger, U. S. Signal Observer at Bering Island. The writer was 
requested to descibe them in case they appeared, after due investigation, 
to be new. 
1. Hali^etus hypoleucus Stejneger, MS. 

Sp. ch. — Young 9 (No. 89127, collector's No. 1055, Bering Island, May 
15, 1882). Ground color of pileum, nape, upper back, rump, with lesser 
and middle wing-coverts dirty white, spotted with grayish brown, the 
spots of the latter color being chiefly subterminal, but often occupying 
the tips of the feathers; upper part of rump with white largely pre- 
dominating; greater wings-coverts and longer scapulars uniform dusky, 
bordered terminally with mottled dirty grayish white; tertials uniform 
slate-dusky ; upper tail -coverts mottled dusky terminaly, mottled white 
basally ; remiges uniform brownish black; rectrices blackish dusky, the 
inner webs much mottled with pale grayish and buffy white. Side of 
head with a broad and distinct stripe of nearly uniform brown, occupy- 
ing the entire orbital, and auricular regions. Entire lower parts white, 
all the feathers with distinct dusky shafts ; those of throat streaked 
with pale brown, those of jugulum and upper breast with a large ter- 
minal spot of dusky, many of the feathers of sides and abdomen with 
small and usually indistinct brown terminal spots; thighs and crissum 
dirty white, the feathers with dusky terminal spots, these largest on 
crissum, and on upper and inner portions of thighs coalesced so as to 
form the predominating color. Underside of wing white, spotted with 
dusky. Bill dusky, inclining to yellowish at tip and base, the rictus 
yellow; "iris faint yellowish white"; feet deep yellow, claws black. 
Wing 24.50 (ends of primaries much abraded), tail 13.50, culmeu 2.25, 
depth of closed bill 1.50, tarsus 3.60 (naked portion in front only 1.75, 
after raising the feathers), middle toe 3., hind claw 1.80. 

This eagle is perhaps the eastern representative of U. albicilla, al- 
though the latter, according to Sharpe (Cat. B. Brit. Mus., i, p. 304), 
occurs "in Kamtschatka, the Aleutian Islands, and Japan," and also 
in China, " as far as Amoy." It is barely possible, however, that all ref- 
erences to H. albicilla in the above-named countries may in reality apply 
to the present bird or (especially so far as the Aleutians are concerned) 
to R. leucocephalus, the latter occurring abundantly, not only throughout 
the Aleutian chain, but also in Bering Island, where, according to Dr. 
Stejneger, it breeds. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 91 

I Lave never seen a specimen of true H. albidlla at all resembling- in 
coloration the bird described above, while its reference to 11. leucocepha- 
lus seems to me out of the question, the proportions differing- decidedly 
from those of the latter species; the bill and feet being much larger 
than in a specimen of the bald eagle of equal size so far as other meas- 
urements are concerned. I am therefore strongly inclined to agree with 
Dr. Stejueger as to its distinctness from either of the above-named spe- 
cies, although, as suggested above, it may be the eastern representative 
race of if. albicilla. 

Dr. Stejneger's remarks concerning this specimen are to the following 
effect : 

After alluding to the fact that H. leucocephalus not only occurs but 
also breeds on Bering Island, and that the Thalassoaius pelagicus can 
only be considered an irregular if not wholly casual visitant — "a lonely 
straggler from Kamtschatka" — he says: "It seems that a third species 
of sea eagle must be added, not only to the fauna of Bering Island, but 
even to the list of known birds, for I have never seen a young Halicctus 
with the whole lower surface white and the upper parts with dark tips 
and edgings on a whitish ground, such as my No. 1,055. This, a young 
female, still with black tail, was shot the 15th of May, and measures 
890 mm (35 inches) in length, with a stretch of wings of 2.220 m (87.40 
inches). Iris faint yellowish white,* bill horn-brown, cere yellow, with 
horn-brown shadings on top; feet bright golden jellow. 

" Compared with the young of H. leucocephalus of the same age, it 
has, apart from the white color of the body, the tail-feathers, under 
tail-coverts and axillars, still darker colored. The size is in some re- 
spects inferior to that of the bald eagle, the specimen sent represent- 
ing the maximum of its kind, being not larger than an old male of said 
species.t The bill holds fully the size of that of a young H. leucocepha- 
lus, and the feet likewise, but the body, the wing, and tad are smaller. 

" I have little doubt that this bird growing old would have assumed 
an almost uniform white plumage below, with white tail:}: a supposition 
corroborated by the statement of Mr. Grebnitzky that he had himself 
seen an eagle on the island having the lower parts and the tail white. 



* In the young of H. leucocephalus, even when two or more years old, the iris is usu- 
ally if not always deep brown, and the bill and eere blackish, while in 11. albicilla 
the iris is always (?) brown in the young, and sometimes in the adult also ! 

tUpon this point I am inclined to disagree with Dr. Stejueger, and as for size and 
proportions, would rather compare the specimen with the adult male of II. albicilla. 

tin Dr. Stejneger's specimen, the middle rectricee have been moulted, and those of 
the new dress are just making their appearance. They are even darker in color than the 
old ones, although similarly marked, which would indicate either that the individual 
rn question would not have attained its perfect plumage the next year or else that 
the adult does not have a white tail. That the specimen is not in its first year is clearly 
indicated by the character of the plumage, as well as by the date of its capture (.May 
loth) ; while that it is probably more than two years old is strongly suggested by the 
light color of the bill and cere which in H. albicilla and H. leucocephalus do not be- 
come yellowish until the bird begins to assume a portion of its adult livery. 



92 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

" That we have not to deal with an albino is evident not only from 
the color of the eyes, but also the character of the whole plumage, the 
white color having a normal appearance, while the dark colors are 
deep and distinct. 

" After due consideration, I come to the conclusion that the present 
species is sufficiently distinct from H. leucoccphalus, and consequently al- 
so from H. albicilla. There are two other species, however, of which I 
know only the names, viz, H. leucoryplius (Pall.) and H. leucogaster (6m.); 
but Dr. Dybowski, who is well acquainted with the former, asserts 
that it is quite a different bird, while Dr. Henry Guillemard, who has 
collected in Central Africa, and is autoptically familiar with the latter, 
repeated the same assurance when seeing my bird during a day's visit 
here. Both received the impression that the species is still an un- 
known one." 

It is, perhaps, needless to remark that Dr. Stejneger's bird is very 
distinct from both H. leucoryphus and H. leucogaster. 

2. Acrocephalus dybowskii Stejneger, MS. 

Sp. ch. — Adult $ (No. 89151, Petropaulovski, Kamtschatka, July 5, 
1882). Above, rather light olive-brown, more decidely olive, or some- 
what tinged with russet, on rump and tail, and slightly more grayish 
across nape; a distinct superciliary stripe of pale buffy-grayish, paler 
anteriorly; a rather indistinct gray loral streak, and a narrow brown 
postocular streak along upper edge of auriculars; auriculars, sides of 
neck and breast, and entire sides, light grayish-olive, the first very nar- 
rowly and indistinctly streaked, especially anteriorly, with white; re- 
maining lower parts dull white, very faintly shaded across jugulum 
with pale brownish-gray; crissum, buffy- white, and flanks tinged with 
deeper buff. Tail much graduated (the lateral feathers .65 of an inch 
shorter than the intermedise), all the rectrices showing indistinct, faintly 
darker bars, the inner webs (except of middle feathers) decidedly darker 
than the outer, and the four outer pairs distinctly tipped with pale 
grayish, becoming nearly pure white on tips of inner webs, these pale 
tips growing gradually narrower toward middle feathers. Maxilla dark 
brown; its edge, with the mandible, pale-brownish (in dried skin), the 
base still paler; "iris hazel"; legs and feet pale flax-brown (in dried 
skin), the toes slightly darker. Wing 2.85, the secondaries 2.15; third 
quill longest, second and fourth equal; tail 2.40, culm en (from frontal 
feathers) .48, bill from nostril .31, tarsus .00, middle toe .60. 

Dr. Stejneger sends the following interesting account of the habits of 
of this species : 

"The loud song, consisting of the syllables ■icWshe-icifshe-tcifshe-icit.sh, 
and somewhat resembling the sound made by whetting a scythe, was 
heard, especially towards night, from all sides, among the high grass 
and willows which cover the swampy slopes of the mountains with a 
thicket almost impenetrable to both foot and eye. It was but seldom I

could get a glimpse of a watchful sougster, as be, clinging to the middle 
of an upright stalk of some high grass or orchid, did bis best in a sing- 
ing match with another of his own kind or a Calliope JmmtschatJcensis 
or Carpodacus erythrinus. But no sooner did I move my gun to secure 
the longed-for specimen than he silently disappeared, as traceless and 
suddenly as if he was tbe possessor of Dr. Fortunatus's cap. Tbe 
only way to obtain oue was to watch patiently near his favorite perch, 
with gun in hand. For hours have 1 sat thus in the wet swamp, almost 
desperate from the stings of the numberless bloodthirsty mosquitoes, 
which I did not dare to wipe off for fear of driving away the silent 
bird, who, after watching my immovable figure until satisfied of his 
safety, came cautiously nearer, slipping between tbe stems and branches 
near tbe ground ; uttering finally a very low, thrush-like talc;-tak,-ta]c ;- 
tak; witb his tail held upright, very much iu the manner of a long-tailed 
wren. If I kept absolutely quiet he would sometimes come close to my 
feet, looking curiously up at me with his dark pretty eyes. But before 
the challenge of a rival had attracted his attention and provoked a 
reply, which he usually began with a short trill, it would not be advis- 
able to move a muscle. Then it would be time to lift the gun, very 
slowly, hesitating as often as he suspiciously stops his song, until the 
report puts an end to it forever, and I held in my hand a badly muti- 
lated specimen, unfit for preservation; the alternative being to return 
without anything, since by kilting him at longer range it would impos- 
sible to find the small plain-looking bird in the dense and luxuriaut 
mass of vegetation. 

" Should the species prove to be a new one, I propose that the name 
of its first discoverer be affixed to it, that the Acrocephalus dybowslcii 
might rest as a memento of his meritorious and unwearying work in 
Kamtschatka." 

3. Anorthura pallescens Stejneger, MS. 

Sp. ch— Adult $ (No. 88994, U. S. Nat. Mus., collections No. 1G44, 
Bering Island, Sept. 20, 1882). Above dull smoky-brown (far less rusty 
than in A. alascensis), uniform on pileum, nape, and upper back, but 
lower back and rump barred with dusky, the wing-coverts and upper 
tail-coverts still more distinctly barred with the same; middle wing- 
coverts tipped with a small deltoid spot of pure white; outer webs of 
five outer primaries spotted with brownish-white, the remaining quills 
with outer webs plain dull brown. Tail brown, crossed by 6 or 7 rather 
wide bands of blackish, the last three or four rendered more distinct by 
a decided lightening of the brown against their posterior edge; on the 
middle rectrices, however, the bars much less distinct and more irregu- 
lar. Lores, an indistinct superciliary stripe, malar region, chin, throat, 
jugulum, and sides of breast dull light-brownish buff (much paler and 
duller than in A. alascensis), the middle of breast and upper part of 
belly much paler, or inclining to brownish white; sides, flanks, and

crissuin brownish white, broadly and distinctly barred with dusky, the 
sides more tinged with brown. Auriculars dusky brown, streaked with 
the color of the throat. Bill brownish-black, more brown on lower 
basal portion of mandible; " iris dark brown "; legs and feet dark brown. 
Wing 2.15, tail 1.G0, culmen (from frontal feathers) .50, bill from nostril 
.38, tarsus .75, middle toe .oo. 

A young bird from Copper Island is colored more like A. alascensis, 
and may be the same species or an intermediate race. The upper parts 
are entirely uniform rusty brown, becoming brighter rusty on rump and 
upper tail-coverts. 

This new race is totally unlike the Japanese A. fumigata (Temm.), 
which is a small form of very dark coloration, and somewhat like A. 
hyemalis pacifica of the Pacific coast of Korth America, but, as a matter 
of course, very distinct. In large size and general proportions it agrees 
quite closely with A. alascensis (Baird), but the coloration is entirely 
different, as the following comparative diagnosis may show, the compar- 
ison being made between two adult males in autumnal plumage (the 
one of A. pallescens obtained September 20, that of A. alascensis October 
21): 

A. pallescens. — Above dull smoky-brown, the lower back, rump, and 
upper tail coverts distinctly barred with dusky; indistinct super- 
ciliary stripe, lores, malar region, chin, throat, and sides of breast 
dull pale brownish-buff; lower breast and upper belly dull brown- 
ish-white; sides, flanks, and crissum brownish-white, broadly and 
distinctly barred with dusky. Wing 2.15, tail 1.60, culmen (from 
frontal feathers) .50, bill from nostril .38, tarsus, .75, middle toe .55. 
Rob. Bering Island. 
A. alascensis. — Above, bright rusty brown, becoming more rufous 
posteriorly, the lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts without 
trace of bars; superciliary stripe, lores, malar region, chin, throat, 
jugulum, breast, and sides, deep fulvous-buff, the belly similar, but 
slightly paler; flanks and anal region rusty brown, narrowly and 
indistinctly barred with dusky ; crissum bright rusty -brown, each 
feather tipped with a pure white spot, this preceded by a dusky 
one. Wing 2.10, tail, 1.50, culmen .GO, bill from nostril 40, tarsus 
.80, middle toe .GO. Hab. (of specimen described) Unalashka. 
There are several species or races of this genus belonging to the 
elevated regions of Central and Eastern Asia, which appear to be more 
or less nearly related to this new form, but I have not been able to make 
a direct comparison with any of them. The one which seems to come 
nearest, judging from descriptions, is A. neglecta (Brooks) from Gilgit 
and Cashmere (alt. 5,000-10,000 ft.), but there appear to be decided dif- 
ferences of coloration, while the habitat is of itself an almost certain 
indication of their distinctness. (Cf. Shaepe, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., 
vi, p. 278.) 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 95 

4. Hirundo saturata Stejneger, MS. 

Sp. ch. — Similar to II. crythrogastra, but much more richly colored 
beneath, the lower parts in the male being about the same color as the 
throat of the male iu H. eryikrogastra, and of the female a shade darker 
than the same parts in the male of that species. Adult male (No. 8!)1(J5 
Petropaulovski, June 28, 1882): Upper parts rich violaceous steel-blue 
(exactly as in H. erythrogastra), the wings and tail less glossy and more 
greenish ; forehead, malarregiou, chin, and throat, rich chestnut (a shade 
darker, especially on throat, than in eryikrogastra), the steel-blue of the 
neck encroaching on the sides of the jugulnm, and extending interrupt- 
edly across the latter in the form of a narrow, broken collar ; remaining 
lower parts rich chestnut rufous. Eectrices marked with white, exactly 
as in erythrogastra. Wing 4.70, lateral tail leathers 4.15, middle pair 
1.75, culmen .30, width of bill at base .25, tarsus .40, middle toe .40. 
Adult female (Xo. S910G, same locality and date) : Similar to the male, but 
chestnut of forehead less extensive, that of throat, etc., paler, the lower 
parts paler rufous, but still a shade or so darker than in the male of if. 
erythrogastra. Wing 4.G0, lateral rectrices 3.60, middle pair 1.85. 

This elegant swallow needs no comparison with the Japanese R. 
gutturalis, which is pure white beneath, and otherwise very different. 

(?) Anthus japonicus Temm. & Schleg. (A. stejnegeri, sp. nov., if 
distinct.) 

Sp. en. — Adult, summer plumage : Above light raw-umber brown, 
very distinctly streaked with black, these markings broadest on the back, 
the exterior feathers of which have the inner webs chiefly dull whitish, 
producing, when the feathers lie in natural position, a distinct stripe 
on each side of the interscapular region ; scapulars much less distinctly 
streaked with dusky, and without light edgings; middle wing coverts 
dusky, broadly and very distinctly streaked with brownish white; greater 
coverts more narrowly tipped with brownish white or very pale buff, 
and edged with light brown; remiges dusky, edged with light brown; 
middle rectrices similar, but others dusky, the outer pair mostly dull 
brownish white, or pale dull buff, with a dull brownish dusky space 
along edge of basal half of inner web ; next feather with the outer web 
pale dull brownish buff, and the inner web with the terminal portion 
and stripe along shaft, nearly to the base, of the same color. Lower parts 
buffy white, the whole jugulum yellowish buff, of varying intensity, and 
distinctly, though not always sharply, streaked with dull black ; super- 
ciliary stripe and side of head generally pale buff, the auriculars more 
brownish, especially along upper margin, where sometimes streaked 
with dusky ; a small dusky spot immediately in front of eye, and throat 
sometimes bordered along each side by an interrupted series of narrow 
blackish streaks (these usually, however, nearly or quite obsolete) ; sides 
and flanks streaked with blackish, and longer lower tail-coverts also 
sometimes streaked. Maxilla brownish black, the tomia light brown-

ish; inaudible pale brownisb, darker terminally, paler at base; "iris 
dark brown"; legs and feet deep brown, the tarsi rather paler. Wing 
3.10-3.45, tail 2.25-2.50, culmen .48, bill from nostril .35, tarsus .95-1, 
middle toe .Gj-.70, hind claw .40-.50. First, second, and third quills 
longest, and nearly equal (first, however, usually longest), fourth decid- 
edly (.15 of an inch or more) shorter. 

The six specimens collected by Dr. Stejneger differ more or less 
from one another in details of coloration and proportions. The mini- 
mum dimensions, as given above, are represented by a female (No. 89135, 
collector's No. 1231) from Copper Island. All the remaining specimens 
being males, there is much uniformity of size among them. The color- 
ation varies much in intensity, notwithstanding the birds were all killed 
on nearly the same date. The deepest colored individual is No. 89134, 
from Copper Island. In this the lower parts are bright, though (ex- 
cept on breast) rather pale, yellowish buff, with a sulphury tinge, ap- 
proaching white only on the abdomen and chin ; the lower tail-coverts 
are a deep creamy buff, the longer with a distinct dusky streak near end. 
Along each side of throat extends quite a distinct though broken line 
of fine sagittate markings, extending almost if not quite to the chin. 
The palest example is No. 88992, from Bering Island. In this, the 
lower parts are buffy white, the breast and jugulum more distinctly 
buffy ; the crissum is creamy white, or buffy white, and entirely immac- 
ulate ; there is no trace of the line of dusky streaks along side of throat. 
Other specimens are variously intermediate, and there can be little 
doubt that the variation is, in part at least, purely individual. 

There being no copy of the Fauna Japonica (Aves) accessible to me, I 
am unable to verify the conjectured identity of this species with the 
Anthm japonicus of Temminck & Schlegel. Even if not this species it is 
probably already described, but I have not been able to find any descrip- 
tion at all applicable ; and in view of the possibility of its proving new to 
science, I propose that it should bear the name of its talented discoverer.

All of the specimens (four) were dry and more or less imperfect. The 
chief characters of the form, however, are so well marked as to readily 
admit of identification from the following description. 

Radioipes,* n. g. 

Polyp-mass or ccenosarc linear, elongated, rooted; round, oval, or 
ovate in cross-section. Style or axis long, slender, attenuated, and 
tapering; calcareous and brittle; four sided or obtusely quadrangular 
to nearly round in cross-section; basal end furcate, ramified radiciform. 

RADICIPES PLEUROCRISTATUS,t U. S. 

Polyp-mass linear elongate attenuate, tapering; polypiferous portion 
about three-fourths to four-fifths of total length; the lowest fourth or 
fifth squarish round to round in cross-section and free from polyps: 
ovate to ovate elliptic in cross-section through center of polypiferous 
part ; polyps arranged unilaterally in a single series, one above another 
along one edge or angle of the style ; the sarcode of each polyp inclosing 
and sustained by numerous slender elongated spieulae. 

Axis or style long, slender, hard and bony, tapering simply to a fine 
tip; opposite or basal end forked, varicate and root-shaped. 

The specimens before me vary from 20 inches to 3 feet or more in 
length, and from twelve-hundredths to sixteen-hundredths of an inch 
in diameter, measured at a point about half an inch above the root. 

Remarks. — The most perfect of the four styles is 20 inches long with 
about 2 ipches of the tip wanting, and twelve-hundredths of an inch in 
diameter near the base. The diameters of the others are, respectively, 
fourteen-hundredths, fifteen-hundredths, and sixteen-hundredths of an 
inch just above the base. The last specimen must have been over 3 feet 
in length, judging from the diameter of the axis at the point of fracture. 

While the arrangement of the polyps as seen in such portions of the 
styles as still hold their dried remains intact, indicates the unilateral 
and uuiserial system above described, there is some little evidence of a 
twisting of the soft parts around the axis, which is not unusual in forms 
of this class. 

The polyps occur with much regularity to the number of six or eight 
to the inch or from twelve-hundredths to sixteen-hundredths of an inch 
apart from center to center. 

The angularity of the style (though obtuse) and the one-sided arrange- 
ment of the polyps point to a close relationship with Paronorin (P. 
quadrangularU) in one direction, and the root-Shaped base closely con- 
nects the Pennatula tribe (Pennatulacca) with the Gorgonacca. 

When the characters of the axial styles in the various pennatulid 
groups are compared, the form described by Mr. Fisher as Virgularia 
ornata % from specimens dredged by him in Hakodadi Bay, Japan (7

fathoms, muddy bottom), acquires additional interest. In this the basal 
end of the style is broadly falciform and abruptly curved at a nearly 
right angle to the line of the axis, a shape peculiarly well adapted for 
either permanent or prolonged anchorage in a muddy bottom, and in this 
respect certainly superior to, and advantageous over, the simpler based 
rods or styles iu most of the species. V. ornata, it seems to me, tills the 
plaee of an intermediate and eonnecting link between what may be 
called the simple stalked pennatulids and the furcate-rooted species I 
have described in this paper. Such marked variation in the form of the 
styles seems to indicate a corresponding difference iu habit. 

It will hardly be questioned that the rooted form points to a sedentary 
habit, and a fixed and permanent local habitat; and the simple forms of 
axial rods, with such relevant data as we have at hand, imply, if not a 
positively and continuously active natatory capacity, certainly a less 
sedentary existence, more freedom, and greater activity of habit. As 
relating to the foregoiug implication we may consider the following: 

Bohadsch says that the Peunatulre swim by means of their pinnae, 
which they use in the same manner that fishes do their tins. Ellis says 
it "is an animal that swims freely about in the sea," "many of them 
having a muscular motion as they swim along;" and in another place 
he tells us that these motions are effected by means of the pinnules or 
feather-like tins ; " these are evidently designed by nature to move the 
animal backward or forward in the sea, consequently do the office of 
fins. 1 ' (Phil. Trans, abridg., xii, 42.) Pallas adopted, with some reser- 
vation (Misc. Zool., p. 177), the opinion of Bohadsch; * * * Cuvier 
tells us that they have the power of moving by the contractions of the 
fleshy part of the polypidom, and also by the combined action of its 
polyps; and to adopt the words of Dr. Grant, "a more singular and 
beautiful spectacle could scarcely be conceived than that of a deep 
purple Fen. phosphorea, with all its delicate transparent polypi ex- 
panded and emitting their usual brilliant phosphorescent light, sailing 
through the still aud dark abyss by the regular and synchronous pul- 
sations of the minute fringed arms of the whole polypi." And Bohadsch 
asserts that he has been a witness of this spectacle. But some authors, 
like Lamarck and Schweigger, reasoning from what is known regarding 
other compound animals, have denied the existence of this great locomo- 
tive power in a zoophyte placed so low in the scale as "contrary to every an- 
alogy, and not necessary to the existence or wants of the animal." To the 
foregoing, relating to the allied group Pennatuhe quoted from Johnston's 
British Zoophytes,* that author adds his opinion in these words: "And 
there is little doubt these naturalists are right, for when placed in a basin 
or plate of sea- water the Pennatula' are never observed to change their 
position, but remain on the same spot, and lie with the same side up or 
dowu, just as they have been put in." To this I may say, by way of com- 
ment, that much depends on the length of time and under what condi-

tions such experiments are made. What Johnston says might be ap- 
plied with equal truth to some of the acephalous mollusca, like Mya 
erenaria, for instance, which though sedentary still possesses a certain 
degree of mobility, but nevertheless is so sluggish that one may wait 
and watch for some time without detecting any evidence of activity or 
voluntary motion. The protection or security of these low forms is 
through the secretive faculty; the more active hiding in the mud under 
stones or upon something which is the same color as themselves, or upon 
or amid objects of brighter colors by which their own is rendered obscure 
by contrast, or else seeking security by remaining motionless. It is not 
improbable that such animals may have periods or seasons of activity, 
and perhaps in their young or adolescent stages are much freer, else the 
geographical distribution of the species would be wholly mechanical 
exterior to and independent of the organism, and like many low aquatic 
forms be dependent upon currents and upon attachment to drifting ob- 
jects, or to other and more mobile forms of animals. The activity of cer- 
tain Pectens would hardly be presupposed by the closet student through 
the form aud implied ordinary habits of these mollusks, nor from any 
analogies perceptible after a study of either the structure or habits of 
such species or groups as most closely approximate to the fanshells; 
v»t these footless mollusks sometimes exhibit remarkable powers of 
locomotion, equaling in performance the more active cockle-shells (Car- 
dinal), which are provided with a powerful muscular foot, in its way a 
perfect leaping- pole. 

The gigantic virgularian described by me in the proceedings of the 
Cal. Acad., in August, 1873 (Verrillia Blakei*), "the fishermen say 
swims free and is so caught in their uets."t Mr. Chambers, who sent 
a specimen of this form to the British Museum, says : % " They move about 
rapidly in the water, and when brought to the surface move for a fiw 
seconds like a snake, then make a dart swift as lightning, and disappear.'' 
Dr. J. E. Gray, from whose paper the above is quoted, also says: "3£r. 
Clifton describes the Australian species as swimming rapidly in shal- 
low water,'' and adds : "There seems to be no doubt that the Sea- Pens 
and Sea-Rushes do live in groups together, erect, aud sunk in the mud, 
and that they are sometimes found swimming free in the sea; but the 
question is, are the free specimens those that have been disturbed by 
the waves and currents, and do they afterwards affix themselves in the 
mud, or are they vagrant specimeus that live for a time and then die, 
or are eaten by fish, their struggling being mistaken for swimming V 

Various persons referring to Verrillia have reported it as swimming 
free among the dog-fish, &c.

under the names Virgularia elongata* and V. gracilis^ was observed by 
Dr. W. H. Dall in Catalina Harbor, Catalina Island, Cab, darting or 
swimming just below the surface of the water, and his observation 
I regard as especially valuable and confirmatory as to the mobility of 
these animals. If they can move when compelled to do so, through being 
disturbed in an unusual manner, it is difficult to perceive why they may 
not sometimes move of their own instinct or volition, using this last 
word in a restricted sense. The reasons from analogy are in my judg- 
ment full as weighty on the side of mobility as on the other, and the 
testimony of those who have actually seen these animals in their native 
element, including intelligent and ordinary observers, sustains the im- 
plication conveyed by the forms of the axial rods. The most active of 
the groups are quite likely sluggish animals, generally fixed and seden- 
tary; probably not able to continue actively in motion (motion en masse) 
for any great length of time. 

As to the mobility of one group as compared with another, it would 
seem as if those forms wherein the axis is simplest, the pinna? the most 
prominent, or the individual polyps the most numerous, might have an 
advantage over the others. As to the character of the motion, when 
the mass as a unit is detached and moving (swimming) which involves 
reciprocal and rather complex muscular action and implies a more elab- 
orate muscular system than these animals possess, hardly conveys the 
proper idea. Whether the motion requires primarily the simple satura- 
tion or absorption of water by and through the general mass, through 
pores in the basal section or through alleged or suspected terminal ori- 
fices of the iuterdermal longitudinal canals, or via oris — namely, through 
the mouth of each individual polyp — the propulsory movement is un- 
doubtedly due to a sudden act of the coenosarc, a spasmodic and con- 
tractile effort by which the water is ejected and forced out via oris by 
the simultaneous co-operation of all the polyps in the mass. The move- 
ment would be better defined by the word "darting," which is used 
by the fishermen who have seen it. 

Before closing, I should refer to what appears to be another important 
assisting factor in holding on to the bottom, in forms like YerriUia, and 
which is conspicuously exhibited in the species described by Mr. Fisher. 
I allude to the bulbous expansion which the ca'nosarc in that species 
presents at a point just above the falciform termination of the style. 
and also to the elongated bulb of the basal end in YerriUia. Dr. Moss 
refers to this in his article heretofore quoted, and I am prepared to find 
it pertains to all of the simpler stalked forms. As will be perceived at 
a glance, the dilatation of this part materially assists in anchorage, and 
the contraction also readily admits of withdrawal. 

In relation to the geographical distribution of these interesting forms, 
I may add in this connection the discovery of another habitat for Ver-

rillia, by Dr. Dall, who reported it when be was last bere as occurring on 
the cod-fishing banks of the Shamagin Islands, where it annoys the 
fishermen in deep fishing, by reason of their lines becoming entangled 
among the polyps. Dr. Dall presented the California Academy with 
several specimens of the styles obtained by him in this region. Before, it 
was reported from only one place — namely, Burrard's Inlet, Gulf of 
Georgia, British Columbia.

REPORT OX A FRAGMENT OF CLOTH TAKEN FROM A MOUND IN 

OHIO, 

By J. G. HUNT, M. D. 

[Letters to Prof. S. F. Baird.] 

Philadelphia, February 21, 1881. 

Dear Sir: The fragment of cloth you sent me for examination, pur- 
porting to have been taken from a mound in Ohio, has proved not a 
little refractory. It was impossible to detect any structure until proper 
treatment rendered it translucent. I think it a mistake to call such 
cloth "charred"; it is not charred by the action of fire at all, or by slow 
chemical combustion otherwise accomplished. But it is rendered quite 
black and opaque, as all other perishable organic remains become 
when excluded, by burial or otherwise, from the changing conditions of 
atmospheric influence. 

The contents of a mastodon's stomach I once examined were black 
and opaque, like this cloth, but were not "charred." Indeed, we lack a 
term to express this curious condition. 

Those ancient weavers did not practice the art of coating textile 
fibers with heavy chemical combinations, as some modern commercial 
Christians are supposed to do. 

You desire to know exactly what fiber this cloth is made of! Alas! 
My evidence is only negative. It is not cotton; nor hemp; nor flax. I 
think it is not any fiber now used for textile purposes. Though veg- 
etable in its nature, it is not a fiber at all, but. consists of the entire 
stem of the plant, or of large portions of it, no apparent attempt hav- 
ing been made to separate the fiber before manufacturing. I think the 



102 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

plant used for such cloth did not come from the exogeus, but the struct- 
ural evidence is too scanty and indistinct to justify me in speaking more 
decidely. 

The whole subject is of sufficient interest to warrant further study 
and comparison, and if any new facts of identification should appear I 
will write you. If you desire a slide of the material mounted for study. 
I can send one. 

Very respectfully,

Philadelphia, March 13, 1881. 
Dear Sir: I have now carefully examined all those specimens of 
grass sent by Doctor Vasey, and not one of them enters into the tissue 
of the mound cloth. I therefore arrive at the following conclusions re- 
garding the cloth : It is made of vegetable matter. Only one plant en- 
ters into its composition. It is not cotton, flax, hemp, jute, manila, or 
any other fiber now used by civilized people in manufacture. It is not 
a fiber at all, but all or most of the stem has been used for the purpose. 
There has been no attempt made by those ancient weavers to separate 
any special fiber from the plant, and it is probable that they were ig- 
norant of the process of rotting and hackling (so ancient), and now 
often used for that purpose. The fragments of this unknown plant pre- 
sent no distinct structural remains; not a cell can be seen. The only 
feature which may sometime lead to identification is an appearance of 
septa, crossing and apparently separating some fragments into indis- 
tinct divisions, as seen in this little figure [drawing]. If the material 
had been a grass wo would have found some trace of epidermal struct- 
ures, because in most of such plants silica imperishably preserves their 
structures. I think, therefore, that the bark of some other than a gram- 
inaceous plant has been used for the purpose. Again, I have been 
taught how limited is our knowledge of things. We know the names 
of enough things to overstock seven worlds, but of things we don't 
know enough to identify this plant of the ancient mound-weavers. 
Very respectfully, 

J. G. HUNT, M. D.

L17CILIA 3IACELLABIA IMISini; MAN. 

By FRED. IIUMBEBT, M. »., F. C. S. 

Alton, III., October 7, 1882. 

I send you herewith a gag or screw fly ?, as known here ; they are in 
alcohol or alive in a green bottle; some of the maggots are also in 
alcohol. I wish you would hand this species to your entomologist for 
a minute examination and its proper name, as I cannot find a full 
description of this insect and its habits in any books in my possession. 
The following is part of an essay penned in 187G but not published, 
which, with the history of this fly, will explain itself: 

A farmer's wife, thirty-five years of age, was attacked on Monday. 
September 27, 1875, with a headache and a flushed face. She staid at 
work, expecting a malarial chill, an affection prevailing at that time in 
the neighborhood. From this time the pains in the region of the frontal 
cavity at the base of the nose and below the eye, extending to the right 
ear, increased. At times the pain was more severe than at others, but 
it never entirely left. This pain was described as preventing hearing 
and breathing, and so excruciating that at intervals, day and night, her 
cries could be heard at a great distance from the house. Tuesday even- 
ing blood mucus began to run from the right nostril, which was some- 
what swollen, the swelling extending on Tuesday over the whole right 
side of the face. On this day, the fifth of the complaint, four large 
maggots dropped out of the right nostril. When I was first called to 
the patient, Monday, October 4, only the right lip and nostril were 
swollen, the acrid discharge having somewhat blistered the lips below. 
After each discharge the maggot dropped from the nostril, until the 
twelfth day, one hundred and forty or more maggots having escaped. 
The majority of the maggots were three-fourths of an inch in length, 
there being only a few which seemed a line or two shorter; they were 
of a yellow hue, conical shape, and having attached to one end two 
horn -like hooks. The patient recovered fully. 

Monday, September 18, 1882, 1 saw a patient, in the same neighbor- 
hood as the first, suffering from the same malady. At that time two 
hundred and eighty maggots had been discharged, and at the close of 
the illness over three hundred. There was a swelling on each side of 
the nose, with a small opening to each. I lanced these openings and 
more maggots came out. 

In the Indian Territory the so-called screw-fly laid its eggs in the 
nose of man. In 1847 I heard of several deaths of men and children in 
Texas, near Dallas. The gad-fly was common in the American Bottom 
forty years ago. It laid its eggs in the noses of cattle and in the ears 
of horses and deer, but never in the human nose. The fly that I send 
is about four times as large as the common fly. Head a dark, glisten-

ing green ; a bronze lace, very lively in appearance. Is it the same 
that they called in Texas or Indian Territory the screw-fly, or is it the 
gad fly seeking a new Held I 

The patient of 187.") is now alive and well. The second case occurred 
two years ago near Colliusville, in this county, and proved fatal. The 
third patient, above named, is getting well. The fourth is reported from 
Georgia; the patient died. 

The first case which 1 had under my charge was the first which ever 
occurred here. The eggs must have been deposited in the nose several 
days before the fifth, the day the maggots dropped out. On the elev- 
enth day all were discharged. I secured live maggots at that time, 
September 18, 1882. I put soil in an open-mouthed vial and dropped 
the maggots on it ; they crawled in the ground in about five minutes. 
I covered the opening with white damastis and hoped that the next 
year the fly would come out of the ground. But on October C, or 
the twentieth day, the vial had fourteen living flies. So, reckoning 
from six days before the pain commenced for the laying of the eggs, to 
the twelfth day, when the maggot discharged, making eighteen days, 
and to this adding the twenty days during which the grubs were in the 
ground, we have thirty-eight days from the time the fly laid the egg 
until a new generation of Hies is produced from them. 

You may think I have dwelt too long on these cases, but if you had 
to stand at the bed and had seen the suffering and despair of the pa- 
tients and found that the worms were eating them up, you would not 
think so. 

Respectfully, 

FRED. HUMBERT, M. D., F. C. S.

Sir: The insect referred to in the accompanying communication from 
Dr. Fred. Humbert, of Alton, 111., is the Lucilia macellaria of Fabricius, 
the injuries of which to different animals are well known in the South 
and West, where the larva is called the " screw worm." I have re- 
peatedly endeavored to obtain the true parent of this worm, and have 
published items in reference to it in the American Entomologist, 1880, 
pp. 21, 203, and 275. Dr. Humbert's communication is most interesting, 
bat the specimens yet more so, as the flies he forwards are the first that 
have positively been bred from the larva; known as " screw worms,'' and 
they confirm the above determination of the species. The larvae agree 
with others which I have from Texas, taken from the root of the ear ot 
a hog which had been bitten by a dog. In De Bow's Industrial Resources

of the Southern States, vol. i, is an account of its occurrence in remark- 
able numbers in the Southern States in 1834. 

It is an interesting: fact concerning - this insect that it also occurs in 
the Eastern and Middle States, but that in these States we rarely hear 
of its injuries to man or to domestic animals. 

Carbolic soap is considered an excellent preventive in the Southwest, 
and, according to Prof. J. Parish Stelle, who made the experiment for 
me in 1880, pyrethrum blown upon the sores will induce the worms to 
issue forth and leave them.

FISH MORTALITY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

By S. T. WALKER. 

[Letter to Prof. S. F. Baird.] 

Knowing: your interest in everything- connected with fish, &c, I take 
the liberty of giving - you all the facts I have been able to collect in 
reference to the late mortality among- the fishes in Tampa Bay and ad- 
joining- coasts. Had I known before I began my cruise of the extent 
of this mortality and splendid opportunities afforded of collecting - speci- 
mens of strange and perhaps unknown species, I might have gone bet- 
ter prepared for collecting specimens, but I had only heard a few vague 
rumors, and I was little prepared for anything further than a collection 
of facts in regard to the matter. 

On leaving Clear Water, November 20, I sailed south through Boca 
Ceiga Bay, and encountered the first dead fish floating on the water 
near Bird Key, a little southeast of Pass A'Trilla. These were mullet, 
and as we progressed to the south and east I began to encounter toad- 
tish, eels, puff-fish and cow-fish, in immense numbers, and, on attempt- 
ing to land on the extreme point of Point Pinellas for the night, I was 
driven to my boat by the stench of thousands of rotting fish upon tin- 
beach. The next morning 1 went ashore and found the dead fish drifted 
ashore in countless numbers. The eels appeared most numerous, fol- 
lowed by puff-fish, cow fish, sailor's choice, and small fish of every shape 
and variety. After these followed groupers, mangrove snappers, jew - 
fish, gar-pike, spade-fish, sting-rays, and sharks. Other varieties, un- 
known to me, were mixed among these, together with vast numbers of 
catfish. I saw very few mullet here. 

At Gadsden Point about the same species appeared, while at Tampa 
I saw but few dead fish, and they were principally gars and cattish. 
From Tampa 1 proceeded to the mouth of the Little Manatee to obtain 



106 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

some information from Mrs. Hoy concerning her theory accounting for 
the death of the fishes. I subsequently visited the towns of Manatee, 
Palmetto, Bradentown, and proceeded thence to Hunter's Point, in Sar- 
asota Pass, Longboat Inlet being the farthest point south visited. Re- 
turning, I spent several days on Anna Maria Key, where I collected the 
skulls of several kinds of fish; thence, passing northward by way of 
Passage Key, Egmont, Mullet Key, and so on back to Clear Water. 
From Longboat Inlet round to Mullet Key, the dead fish were principally 
mullet, catfish, eels, and groupers, the mullet preponderating at least ten 
to one. Puff-fish, toad-fish, cow-fish, and frog-fish were still extremely 
plentiful ; indeed, I saw no diminution in their numbers, though the num- 
bers of dead mullet had increased very greatly. 

I saw many fish in every stage of sickness, from the first attack to the 
end. All were affected in nearly the same manner. The fish, apparently 
active and healthy, would be swimming along, when suddenly it would 
turn on its side and shoot up to the top of the water, gasping as though 
out of the water, apparently unable to control its motions, often lying on 
its side on the bottom for five or ten minutes motionless, then suddenly 
shooting hither and thither without aim or object, and finally ending the 
struggle on the surface and floating off dead. Whole schools of mul- 
let would suddenly stand upright on their tails, spouting water and die 
in five minutes. Gars would run for a long time with their snouts above 
the water, and then lie motionless, as if dead, for ten or fifteen minutes. 
These generally lived an hour or more after being attacked. I obtained 
specimens of water from various localities, which I send herewith, marked 
to show whence obtained. 

Before giving the statements of others in regard to the matter, I will 
give you the results of my own observation in a very brief manner: 

1. The dead fish were most numerous on the outside beaches and on 
the inside beaches of the outer line of keys. 

2. That dead fish were least numerous about the mouths of creeks 
and rivers, decreasing gradually as one approached such places. 

'■'). That the poisoned water was not diffused generally, but ran in 
streams of various sizes, as proven by fish dying in vast numbers in- 
stantly upon reaching such localities. 

4. That the fish were killed by a specific poison, as proven by the 
sickness and death of birds which ate of the dead fish. 

5. The fish began dying on the outside beaches first, as Mr. Strand, 
assistant light-keeper at Egmont, reports them coming up first on the 
17th of October, while Mrs. Hoy observed them first on the 1st or 2d of 
November, at Little Manatee River. 

G. The examination ot many hundred recently-dead fish revealed no 
signs of disease. The colors were bright, the flesh firm, and the gills 
rosy. The stomach and intestines appeared healthy. 

In my haste I have neglected to state that I saw a good many dead 
birds during the trip. At Tampa, ducks were dying. 1 saw dead vul-

tores at Anna Mark Key, and at Passage Key, large flocks of cor- 
morants were sick and dying'. I also saw the carcasses of terns, gulls. 
and frigate birds. The cormorants sat on the beach with their heads 
under their wings, and could be approached and handled. 

It might be also proper to state that on Monday morning, December 
14, about one hour before day, I heard a roaring southwest of Passage 
Key. apparently far out at Sea, resembling the ''blowing off" of a steam 
boiler. The noise continued some ten minutes and ceased. After day- 
light I heard a similar roaring, which lasted about five minutes. There 
was no steamer in sight in the direction of the sound, and I observed 
no swell in the sea following it. After I got under sail I heard the noise 
a third time. Whether this was followed by the death of fish I am 
unable to say, as I did not stay to see. I mention this incidentally as 
a corroboration of Mrs. Hoy's statement, which is hereto appended. 
Whether or not either of these disturbances of the water had any con- 
nection with the mortality among the fishes, the theory of sub-aqueous 
eruptions of poisonous gases is extremely plausible and reasonable. 

Indian Eock, FIorida, December 21, 1880. 



STATEMENT OF MR. WILLIAMS, OF POINT PINELLAS. 

The fish began dying about the last of October here. All kinds die 
except red-fish. Eels and sea-toads are most numerous, though all kinds 
die. I have seen only a few sheepsheads. I think it is caused by a 
black scum on the water resembling soot. When a school of mullet 
get into water covered by this black scum, they die at once. Oysters 
are affected by this also, and those who eat of them are made very sick. 

STATEMENT OF MR. SPENCER, OF THE TAMPA TRIBUNE. 

I went out last Sunday (November 28), expressly to see for myself, 
and, if possible, to account for the dying of the fishes in Tampa Bay. 
I feel certain, from what I saw, that it is caused by fresh water from the 
creeks, rivers, and marshes. The water where the fish are dying looks 
black and slimy, very different from the usual color of the bay water. 
You see there has been an unusual amount of rain this fall, and this 
becoming impregnated with tin 1 poison of decaying vegetation, is poured 
into the bay in unusual quantities and poisons the fish. This is my 
opinion, and I give it for what it is worth. The oyster saloons here 
were obliged to close, as the oysters came near killing several people. 

STATEMENT OF MRS. CHARLES HOY, OF LITTLE MANATEE. 

" The fish began dying here about the 1st of November. About 8 
o'clock on the evening of October 28, or thereabout, I was sitting on 
my front gallery, the air being perfectly still and the bay calm, when 
I heard a heavy splashing of the water in the direction of Gadsden 
Point. This continued for a few minutes and was immediately followed

by a roaring sound, such as might be made by the wheels of a side- 
wheel steamer near at hand, though the noise seemed to be several miles 
away. This continued for about a quarter of an hour, as near as I 
could guess, when it suddenly ceased. Some 25 or 30 minutes after- 
wards heavy swells began to come up the river, such as come in during 
a heavy blow from the northwest. These continued for a long time, 
gradually becoming lighter until I went to bed. In three days the fish 
began to come up the river dead and dying. I caught several mullet 
that were standing upright in the water, sick, and each had three black 
spots on the back, which gradually faded away. I opened the fish and 
could see nothing the matter with them. The flesh was natural and 
firm, and the gills were normal. 

In regard to oysters I have had a rather rough experience, and can 
with certainty say that they are poisonous. A few days after the fish 
began dying I had a quart of fine oysters for dinner. I had a lady 
visitor on that day, but she did not like oysters and ate none. My 
daughter and I ate heartily of them, and after dinner I took my gun 
and went out to a pond to shoot some ducks. I took a colored woman 
(my cook) along, and before I had gotten half way I began to feel weak, 
and a mist came before my eyes. I kept on, however, to the pond, and 
when I reached it was so blind I could not see the ducks, although the 
water was covered with them. With the assistance of the colored 
woman I got home, when I found my daughter similarly affected and 
unable to walk. Neither Mrs. Simms — the visitor — nor my cook were 
affected, which makes me know it was the oysters. The sickness and 
loss of vision gradually left us after drinking a cup of strong coffee. I 
am confident the death of the fish is caused by the discharge of poison- 
ous gases from the bottom of the sea. 

STATEMENT OF MESSRS. FORGARTY AND WHITTAKER, SMACKMEN 

OF BRADENTOWN. 

We own a smack and fish off the coast from Egmont south to Char- 
lotte Harbor. Our business is about ruined by the death of the fish. 
They are dying off the coast as bad as inshore. Our fish die after we 
put them in the well, frequently in five minutes. We cannot say what 
causes it, as we have no means of ascertaining. The poisoned water 
runs in streaks, for often when three or four smacks are in company one 
or two will lose all their fish in a few minutes, while the others, a short 
distance off, lose none. In one instance, three being in company, two 
lost all their fish, while one lost none, the vessels being only a few hun- 
dred yards apart. 

STATEMENT OF R. B. STRAND, ASSISTANT KEEPER OF EGMONT 

LIGHT. 

The fish first came up dead on the 17th of October in the following 
order: eels, cow-fish, toad fish, small fish, such as sailor's choice, min-

liows, &c. ; terrapins, ducks, and other sea-birds followed. The water 
has the appearance of being very slimy. 

INCIDENT RELATED RY MR. HENDRICKS, POSTMASTER AT PALMETTO. 

Mr. Dolly threw a cast-net into a school of mullet which appeared 
active and healthy. Before he landed them they were all dead in his 
net ; and looking back, the whole school was floating dead on the sur- 
face. 



THE GENERIC NAMES AMITRA WD TliVRls REPLACED. 

By O. BROWN GOODE. 

I am told by my friend Professor Jordan that the names Amitra and 
Thy r is, recently proposed by me for two new genera of fishes, are pre- 
occupied in zoology. I wish to substitute for the former the name 
Monomitra ; for the latter the name Delothyris. Monomitra Uparina will 
consequently be the name for the 2/iparo-like fish noted in the Proceed- 
ings (vol. iii, 1880, p. 478), and Delothyris pellucid us for the transparent 
flounder, noticed in the same volume, p. 344. I wish also to express my 
thanks to Professor Jordan for his act of courtesy.

SHELL BEDS I \ WESTCHESTER, IV. Y. 
By UIERRITT WILLIS. 

Along Pelham Bay bordering on Long Island Sound, in the county of 
Westchester, State of New York, there are numerous shell beds. On 
the northwest side of the bay they are from 25 to 30 feet apart — true 
Kitchen Middens. They line the east side of the bay for some distance. 
There is one covering two or three acres, from which I have collected 
arrow-points, spear-points, arrow-scrapers, pestles, stone axes, knives, 
sharpening-stones, pipes, stone ornaments, &c. I also have taken from 
the shell beds several bones cut off at the joint for some purpose. I 
think they are the leg bones of deer. 

I have collected in the town of Westchester alone some 900 arrow 
and spear heads, besides axes, balls, pestles, and numerous other im- 
plements. 

Yours, respectfully, 

MERRITT WILLIS.

VOTES ON THE NOMENCLATURE OF CERTAIN NORTH AMERICAN 

FISHES. 

By DAVID 8. JORDAN and CHARLES H. GILBERT. 

1 . Lepidosteus spatula Lac6pede. 

We have been enabled to compare the "Alligator Gar" of the South- 
ern United States, with a Cuban "Manjuari" (I. tristcechus Bloch & 
Schneider) in the museum of Cornell University. It is probable that 
our species is distinct from the latter. The most prominent difference 
is in the development of the fulcra, the number of these on each of the 
fins being about twice as many in our specimens of spatula as in the 
single example of tristcechus examined. The number of scales iu a vertical 
series is rather greater in the former. The number of fulcra increases 
somewhat with age, and it maybe that this character will prove worth- 
less. At present, however, it is best to retain the name spatula for the 
species found in the United States. 

"2. Ictiobus. 

We find ourselves unable to recognize Ictiobus, Bubalichtliys, and Car- 
piodes as distinct genera; they may be united under the earliest name, 
Ictiobus. An examination of Rafincsque's manuscript note-books, now 
preserved in the National Museum, shows, beyond a doubt, that the 
original Catostomus bubalus of Rafinesque was identical with the Cato- 
stomus bubalus of Kirtland, or the Bubalichtliys bubalus of Agassiz. It is 
likely that the number of species in the group called Carpiodes has been 
much exaggerated. It is thought by Professor Forbes and Mr. Carman, 
who have worked over the very extensive material in the Illinois Labor- 
atory of Natural History, that not more than two valid species exist. 
The same conclusion has been independently reached by Messrs. Swain 
and Kalb in the study of our own collections. We may, therefore, pro- 
visionally recognize the following as the known species of Ictiobus: 

1. Ictiobus (ticlerognathm) cyprinclla (C. & V.) Ag. (Ichthyobus bubalus 
Ag. nou Rat'.). 

2. Ictiobus (Ictiobus) unis (Ag.) J. & G. 

3. Ictiobus (Ictiobus) bubalus (Raf.) J. & G. 
•1. Ictiobus (Carpiodes) carpio (Raf.) Nelson. 

o. Ictiobus (Carpiodes) cyprinu8(he S.) J. & G. 

'A. Esox vermiculatus Le Sueur. 

It is evident from Ratinesque's manuscripts and drawings above 
noticed, that his Esox vittatus and Esox salmoneus are mythical, being 
known only from fraudulent drawings. The common small pickerel of 
the West, for which the name Esox salmoneus has been used by us, should 
stand as Esox vermiculatus Le Sueur, this name being prior to Esox urn- 
brosus Kirtland. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. Ill 
5. Scytaliscus nom. jxcii. now 

The name ScytaUna given by us in 1880 to a genus of Congrogadoid 

fishes, is perhaps too near Scytalinus Erichson 1840, a genus of Coleop- 
tera. We may therefore substitute for it the name Scytaliscus. The type 
is ScytaUna co-dale J. & G. 



NOTES ON THE NATURAL HISTORY OF LABRADOR. 

By W. A. STEAKINS. 

There has been much contention between the two great powers, 
France and England, as to who first discovered this great peninsula of 
Labrador. It was certainly visited by Sebastian Cabot in 149G; and 
more or less explored by the Portuguese Cortereal, who, it is supposed,, 
named it. 

The popular tradition of the coast seems to be "that one Labrador, a 
Basque whaler, from the kingdom of Nevarre, in Spain, did penetrate 
through the Straits of Belle Isle as far as Labrador Bay, some time 
about the middle of the fifteenth century, and eventually the whole 
coast took its name from that coast and harbor." 

There is very little doubt but that the coast here was visited by 
Xorsemen as early as the tenth century. 

There exists strong proof, also, that the discovery of this coast was 
made known by Basque fishermen. • 

As early as 1509, a chart of the coast had been published and was in 
the possession of the French. 

In 1532, Jacques Cartier visited the coast with Basque fishermen for 
pilots. 

The first established colony in Labrador appears to be that at " Brest," 
now Bradore, which was founded 1508, and soon contained 200 houses 
and 1,000 inhabitants, which number was trebled in the summer time 
or fishing season ; but this colony did not survive over a century or a 
century and a half. 

At present, from Bed Bay to Natashquan, a distance of over 400- 
miles, there is scarcely a township containing more than thirty resident 
families. 

The principal seal-fishing establishments are at La Tabatier, Dog 
Islands, Bradore, Long Point, and L'anse Loup. At these the average 
catch of eight stations, where hand nets are used, that are about 1<> to 
75 fathoms long and 30 feet deep is 800 large and 50 to 100 small harp 
and hood seal. The catch of Newfoundland and other steamers and 
vessels is 13,000 to 16,000 young " white coats" on the ice in the spring. 
These figures are increased or diminished according to the season. 

I have visited nearly every station of importance from Mingan to Tri- 
angle Harbor, some miles north of Belle Isle, and everywhere found the 
people hard at work at their fishery in the summer time. 



112 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Blanc Sablon forms the dividing line between the Province of Que- 
bec on the left hand and southwest and Labrador on the northeast. 

All along the coast there are little harbors and bays some of small 
and some large size. All these places that can harbor a vessel contain 
from one to three and eight — the usual number — of houses. They are 
various distances apart, say from half a mile to 8 miles, though gener- 
ally 3 to 5 miles. It is thus, save iu one or two rough places, easy to 
go along the coast in small boats, stopping here or there in rough 
weather or at night. 

In 1875 I made a summer excursion to Labrador, and remained there 
about two months chiefly within a radius of 00 miles southwest, and 
10 northeast of Bonne Esperauce. 

In 1880 I visited the coast in September, and remained there the fall, 
winter, and spring of 1880-'81, returning home after an absence of just 
one year on the coast. During that time I visited nearly all the im- 
portant points from Mingau to Red Bay. 

In 1882 I spent the summer on the coast again, starting from Boston, 
as I had done in 1875 (my 1880-'81 trip had been from Quebec), with a 
party of about twelve young college men, when much good work was 
done in collecting, but owing to insufficient apparatus only enough to 
show what might be done with a properly fittedout craft going for this 
express purpose and no other. 

The following list of mammals, birds, and plants will show what has 
been accomplished in that line, and it is hoped that they will add, if 
ever so little, to our knowledge of the Labrador fauna and flora. Much 
more remains to be done, however, iu each of these departments. 

My examinations have been chiefly along the sea-coast. The interior 
has been rarely, if ever, to any great extent invaded by man.

MAMMALS. 

During the three trips that I have made to Labrador I have found 
the following mammals more or less abundant (according to their 
designation) all along the coast: 
Lynx canadensis (Desm.), Raf. Canada Lynx. 

Common, especially in winter, when it is hunted for its fur all along 
the coast. 
Canis lupus, Linne, var. geiseo-albus. Ofay IVolf. 

Reported as seen occasionally, but very rare. 
Yulpes fulvus (Desm.), var. fulvus. Bed Fox. 

Abundant, especially in furring season. 
Vulpes fulvus (Desm.), var. argentati s. Silver Fox; Black Fox. 

The former variation is not uncommon ; the latter is rare along the 
coast. I saw three beautitul skins of the black variation, with scarcely 
a light hair in them, caught on the coast. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 113 

Vol. VI, I¥o. 8. Washington, D. C. August 1, 1883. 

Yulpes lagopus, (Linn£) Gray. Arctic Fox. 

Rather common, but getting more and more scarce in Northern Lab- 
rador. 
Mustela pennanti, Erxleben. Fisher. 

Found occasionally in the southern portion of Labrador. 
Mustela Americana, Turton. American Sable ; Marten. 

Abundant inland, in the furrring season, throughout the peninsula. 
Putorius ermlnea, (Linne) Griff. Ermine; Stoat. 

Common all along the coast and probably equally so inland. 
Putorius vulgaris, (Erxl.) Griff. Common small Weasel. 

As far as I can discover equally abundant with P. erminea. 
Putorius vison, (Schreb.) Gapp. Mink. 

Abundant everywhere along the coast and about inland ponds. 
Gulo luscus, (Linne) Sabine. Wolverine. 

Rather common, but not nearly so often taken as one would imagine by 
the trappers. Seems to be pretty generally distributed along the coast. 

Mephitis mephitica, (Shaw) Baird. STcunJc. 

Seen occasionally in the lower portions of Labrador, but is rare. 

Lutra canadensis, Sabine. Otter. 
Common in the furring season all along the coast. 

Orsus americanus, Pallas. Black Bear. 

Common inland and along the high bluffs by the sea shore, all along 
the coast. 
ThalarctoS maritimus, (Linne) Gray. White or Polar Bear. 

Rare, occasionally seen on blocks of floating ice off shore in the ex- 
treme northern portions. Twice recorded as far down through the 
straits of Belle Isle as Blanc Sablon. 

Procyon lotor, (Linne) Storr. Raccoon. 

"Occurs at Square Island." — Packard. 
Phoca vitulina, Linne. Harbor Seal. 

Common. Rears its young on sand-bars about 15 to 20 miles up the 
rivers in the interior in the spriug. Abundant outside in the fall. 

Phoca fcetida, Fabricius. Ringed Seal. Jar. 

Not uncommon in harbors in spring and fall. Distinguished from 
last species only on close examination. 

Phoca grcenlandica, Fabricius. Harp f Seal. 
Common in migrations all along the shores south of Belle Isle. 
Proc. Nat. Mus. 83 8 



114 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Erignathus barbatus, (Fabricius) Gill. Square-Flipper Seal. 

Rather common on cakes of floating ice in the spring, all along the 
coast. 

Cystophora cristata, (Erxl.) Nilsson. Hooded Seal. 

With P. grcenlandica, but less common. 
Odobjenus obesus, (Illiger) Allen. Walrus. 

Rare along the coast of Northern Labrador.- Two were shot in 1880 
and 1881, at Fox Harbor, St. Lewis Sound, off the shore a little way. 
A gentleman of our party obtained the tusks of one of them, which 
were about 7 inches long and nearly an inch in diameter. 

Regarding the deer of Labrador some confusion exists. Two species, 
about equally common, are found throughout the peninsula in small, or 
less frequently in large (300 or 400), herds. They are probably the 
following: 

Tarandus rangifer, Brookes, var. caribou. Woodland Caribou ; and 

Tarandus rangifer, Brookes, var. grcelandicus. Barren Ground 
Caribou. 

Alces malchis, (Linne) Gray, the Moose, and Cervus canadensis, 
Erxleben, the American Elk, have both been reported as found on the 
southwestern portion of Labrador, about north from Anticosti, but 
they are doubtless very rare and occasional. 

Ovibos moschatus, Blainville. Musk Ox. 

On the authority of Prof. A. S. Packard a single relic of this auiinal 
may be accredited to this region. Probably it was its most southern 
limit in former times. 

Delphinapterus catodon, (Linne) Gill. White Whale. 

Common in the Saint Lawrence River, at least as far as Anticosti. 
Monodon monoceros, Linne. Narwhal. 

Given on the authority of Professor Packard, but it is probably 
exceedingly rare. 

Orca gladiator, (Bonnaterre) Gray. Killer. 

Occasional all along the coast apparently. 
Globicephalus intermedium, (Harlan) Gray. Black-fish. 

Common in the Gulf, at least to the mouth of the Straits of Belle 
Isle. 

Grampus griseus, (Cuvier) Gray. Grampus. 

Not uncommon all along the shores to Belle Isle, and perhaps farther. 
PHYSET&R macrocephalus, Linne. Sperm Whale. 

Occasionally taken along the coast, as I am informed by the traders 
and people. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 115 

Sibbaudius borealis, (Fischer) Geoffroy. Sulphur -bottom Wliale. 

Not regarded as rare. Frequently taken by the people along the 
shore. One towed ashore at Old Fort Island in 1878 or 1879. 

One of the whalebone whales is occasionally taken along this coast, 
but which species it is I cannot tell. I am sure that several species 
both of whales and porpoises will be eventually added to this list. 

Sciuropterus volucella, (Pallas) Geoffroy, var. hudsonius. Flying 
Squirrel. 

Occasional along the coast. Specimens found at Saint Augustine. 
Sciurus hudsonius, Pallas. Red Squirrel. 

Common in the woods along the shore, and probably inland also, 
all along the coast. 

Gray Squirrels are said to occur here also, but 1 did not see any. 

Arctomys monax, (Linn6) Schreber. Woodchuck. Whistler. 

Common at Mingan, growing scarce towards Bonne Esperance. 
Castor fiber, Linne. Beaver. 

Common in inland ponds all along the coast in furring season, but 
growing rapidly scarce. 

Zap us hudsonius, (Zimmermann) Cones. Deer Mouse. Jumping 
Mouse. 

Not rare on the dry tops of many of the islands along the coast. 
Hesperomys leucopus, (Raf.) Le Conte. Wliite-footed Mouse. 

Occurs probably about equally abundant with Z. hudsonius. 

A species of Arvioola, or Meadow Mouse is very abundant in sum- 
mer. 

Fiber zibethicus, (Linne) Cuvier. Muskrat. 

Very common in the ponds inland all along the coast, at least to 
Belle Isle. 

Erethizon dorsatum, (Linne) F. Cuvier. White-haired Canadian 
Porcupine. 
Very common along the coast certain years ; periodical. Killed by the 
Indians for food. 

Lepus americanus, Erxleben, var. americanus. Northern Varying 
Hare. 
Common, some years even abundant. 

[Lepus americanus, Erxleben, var. virginianus. Southern Varying 
Hare. 

Occurs in Newfoundland, but has not yet been recorded from Labra- 
dor.!

Vespertllio subulatus, Say. Little Brotcn Bat. 

A specimen flew on board our vessel one night, when about oppo- 
site Natashquan, and was secured. Other species doubtless occur. 



BIRDS. 



The following list of birds comprises those collected during a stay of 
twelve months on the coast in 1880-'81, and also some additions made 
the summer of 1882. A few are added on the authority of Dr. Coues

PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 121 

79. SOMATERIA SPECTABILIS. King Eider. 

Abundant in spring in large flocks. I shot a great many of them. 
It is said to breed in this region occasionally. In the Canadian Sports- 
man and Naturalist, vol. 1, No. 7, July 15, 1381, p. 51, in an article 
headed "Bird-nesting in Labrador," Mr. Napoleon A. Comeau, the 
writeT, whom I know personally and who spoke with me personally to 
the same purport, says that on a small island opposite Mingan : " In- 
deed, one small island, visited by us, was almost covered with the nests 
of this species (S. mollissima), and here ice first found the nest of its con- 
gener, the King Eider (S. spectabilis).' 1 '' This is, I believe, the first record 
of this rare nest found on the Atlantic. 

Somateria v-nigra. Pacific Eider. 

Abundant in large flocks in spring. I myself obtained specimens 
that had the decided " Y-shaped black mark " on the chin, and was told 
by the natives that there were '* three different species of spring ducks 
so near alike that you could hardly tell the difference." This species 
has been doubted by several authorities. I still believe that I can se- 
cure specimens and prove its occurrence unquestionably.

Abundant; more so south of Esquimaux River. Breeds like U. torda 
in vast colonies on the islands along the coast. 



REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS. 

There are few members of this class to be found on the Labrador 
coast, yet, strange to say, on but one part of the coast, in the marshes 
about the mouth of Pinway (Black River on the charts) river, about 12 
miles from Point Amour Light-House, the air was full of the pipings 
of some species of frog which I was unable to secure specimens of, as 
we did not stop at this point. The inhabitant, at one or two places 
along the coast invariably said : " There are frogs at Finway, but we 
know of none anywhere else on the coast." 

Professor Packard found Rana sejitentrionalis at Okkak, also Pletho- 
don glutinosa at Belles Amour. The Reptilian fauna will probably be 
enlarged, but not to any great extent. 



FISHES. 

A very few of the species iu this most important department have 
been secured this year, 1882; and though they are only the most com- 
mon and abundant species, they will perhaps se'rve to show a part of 
the characteristic fish fauna of this region. 

Ctenolabrus adspersus. Common Blue perch. 

Was very common all about Cape Britain. 
Gasterosteus aculeatus. Common Stickleback. 

Abundant in large swarms everywhere about the shoal waters of Cape 
Britain. I saw two specimens of Gasterosteus biaculeatus, taken off coast 
in the midst of a large sea, sporting in immense areas close by the vessel. 



124 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 
GASTEROSTEUS PUNGITIUS. 

Was found occasionally off Gape Breton coast. 
Oszkerus mordax. Smelt. 

Common in August, all along the shoal water off the wharfs of Cape 
Britain. 

Scomber scombrus. Mackerel. 

Seldom taken at all on the Labrador coast, except as isolated individ- 
uals or by twos and threes. One person at Triangle Harbor took eight 
while we were there, but said that he had not taken as many before in 
as many years. 

Salmo salar. Salmon. 

Common everywhere iu the mouths of rivers all along the Labrador 
coast. The most abundant species of the family. 

Salvelinus fontinalis. Speckled Brook-trout. 

Abundant in all the streams along the coast, seldom growing large. 
Is said not to be found in the ponds or far from the mouths of the streams, 
not mingling much if any with the large sea trout. 

Mallotus villosus. Caperlin. 

Abundant in large colonies in shoal water all along the coast. Used 
for cod bait, and pursued and fed on by the codfish in the water. When 
traveling iu these large bodies the movements of the whole body seem 
to be almost simultaneous, and though the front of the phalanx is gen- 
erally composed of a single fish, the two sides fall off triangularly, so 
that, strange to say, the change of direction appears, if it is not in 
reality, to be simply the assuming the chief position by any fish, in any 
position along the line, while all the others immediately fall into their 
proper place, and the whole body moves off as an acute triangular 
shaped mass of living Caperlin. When few in number, they delight to 
swim singly, or by twos or threes in a long line, repeatedly sinking and 
swimming under the vessel from side to side, shortly returning again. 

Clupea harengus. English Herring. 

Abundant north of Blanc Sablon, growing more and more so all along 
the Labrador coast, the further down which are the greatest catches. 
The young fish remain about in the waters all the year, if the reports of 
several different individuals can be credited. The people tell me that 
they refrain from catching the fish until September, so that the young 
may have a chance to grow to the fine, large fish for which this region 
is so celebrated, but that the nets might be drawn full of small fish in 
any month of the year when the ice did not interfere. 

Gadus morrhua. Common Cod. 

Abundant everywhere ; but usually the fish are small, and seldom 
the size of those taken off the Grand Banks. Most of them go to France, 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 125 

where they seem to be preferred to the larger fish. The larger fish are 
taken chiefly in the fall, in deep water — 70 to 100 fathoms — the spring 
and summer fish average 3 to 8 and 10 pounds, and are taken in about 
8 to 15 fathoms of water. The Squid is not common nor even " not rare" 
aloug the Labrador coast. Although it is an abundant bait off New- 
foundland, it is very rare along the Labrador coast. 

Gadus ogac. Greenland Codjish. 

Occasionally, but rarely, taken in deep water off the Labrador coast. 
Frequently taken within a mile from shore along the northern part of 
the coast, especially north of Belle Isle. Often regarded as much more 
delicate eating than the common cod. Seldom grows large. Swims in 
bodies with small "torn cods," as they are called, which are probably the 
young of the common cod. 

Cottus scorpioides. Sculpin. 

Common in shoal water, about the fish stages, all along the coast. 

Cottus grcenlandicus. Northern Sculpin. 

Common, with scorpioides, all along the coast. 
Gymnacanthus pistilliger. Sculpin. 

Rather common in the northern portions along the coast like the 
others. 

Hippoglossoides platessoides. Arctic Dab. 

Common about the stage heads all along the coast. 
Pleuronectes americanus. Common Flounder. 

Bather common, usually in deeper water than the H. platesoides, 
along the whole coast. 

SOMNIOSUS MICROCEPHALUS. 

This species of shark is found not rare all along the coast, some years 
doing more damage than others. It breaks the fish-nets, stops the fish 
from attaching themselves to the trolls of the fishermen, and is finally 
captured itself by some of the innumerable hooks of this same troll. 
After tangling and otherwise ruining the lines to the best of its power, 
it itself becomes the prey of the fishermen, who curse it heartily. The 
liver of this fish is said to yield the most delicate and pure oil of any 
fish known upon the coast. Several portions of the vitals are preserved 
by the people with the greatest of care, under the supposition that the 
wearing or carrying of them or the simple having them in the house 
will prove sure protection against not only the rheumatism, but sev- 
eral diseases peculiar to the male sex. 

There are several other species common along the coast but of which 
we were not fortunate enough to obtain specimens, notably the Launce, 
or Lance, the fall bait for the codfish. Several other species of trout are 
also common.

PLANTS. 

In reviewing and adding to the excellent list of "Labrador Plants," 
by the Eev. S. It. Butler (Canadian Naturalist, vol. v, 1870, September, 
p. 350), it seems necessary to say a few words explanatory of the nature 
of the regions bordering the sea-coast, as well also of those in the inte- 
rior of Labrador. 

There are two well-defined areas to which I would call attention; a 
simple designation of them as sea-coast and interior will present to you 
the general idea which I wish to convey. I will draw the line, as near 
as my own observation coincides with that of others, at somewhere be- 
tween 2 and 4 miles inland. Of the interior of this whole region very 
little is known. In summer, woods of mostly low, stunted spruce, with 
various evergreens, are everywhere abundant, and it is with the utmost 
difficulty that one can make any progress whatever. Few have at- 
tempted to penetrate this area, and we know but little of it. Its access- 
ible edges abound in many plants very similar to ours, especially those 
crowning the summits of the White Mountains. That part styled the 
coast differs from the province just mentioned in that it is composed 
mostly of numerous low, hilly, island crests, everywhere interspersed 
with narrow straits of water, besides a narrow ribbon of laud up and 
down the coast line itself. The general flora of all the islands is much the 
same, but there are localized species of both wild and introduced plants. 
Mr. Butler makes the following remarks prefatory to his enumera- 
tion of species in the above-named paper: "The two places 1 have most 
thoroughly examined are Caribou Island and Forteau Bay. When a 
plant is marked ' Caribou,' it is meant that I found it only at that place ; 
when 'Forteau' is mentioned, the plant may occur all around Forteau 
Bay, while 'Amour' means that I have found it only at 'L'ance Amour,' 
and that it is not likely to occur elsewhere in the Bay ; and where no local- 
ity is specified, the species may be expected to occur at many places, if not 
all along the coast." The collection of Miss MacFarlane, referred to in 
the same paper, has also afforded much valuable material. The speci- 
mens collected by myself were procured at Harrington Harbor, the south- 
ernmost limit visited, Baie des Bodies, Bonne Esperanee (iu and about 
Salmon Bay) ; also the "winter quarters" of the inhabitants, a distance 
of 7 miles inland, up Esquimaux River, and which belongs to the main- 
land. 

The list here presented is impartial and imperfect at best, but it will 
suffice until a more accurate and thorough examination of the country 
shall perfect it. The letter B, after a plant, signifies that the remarks 
are by Mr. Butler.

quimaux Island." B. 

84. Rhododendron rhodora, Hon.

at the westward of Bonne Esperance, but on that island it only grows 
sparingly in one little spot. Similarly at Caribou Island, and I saw it 
nowhere else, though it is probably to be found sparingly all along, but 
by no means so plentifully as Kalmia glauca, which is everywhere." I 
found it rather common in several places, and also at Harrington Har- 
bor August 2.

Mr. Butler mentions but few of the rushes, sedges, or grasses in his 
list, merely saying that he collected "neither pines, willows, nor glu- 
maceous plants." I give a list of what specimens I collected, but am 
not able to say anything about their apparent rarity or abundance, as 
they were collected hastily and indiscriminately; the majority of those 
I did notice appeared to me to be more or less common; they were 
named through the kindness of a friend to whom all disputed cases were 
referred. Unless otherwise mentioned, the locality is the inland " winter

ON* THE BLACK NODULES OK SO-CALLED INCLUSIONS IN THE 

MAINE GRANITES. 

BY GEORGE P. MERRILL. 

Accompanying the samples of granite collected by agents in the employ 
of the building-stone department of the tenth census, there were re- 
ceived at the museum from various States, but principally from Maine, 
numerous specimens of the dark nodules or socaUedinchtsiotis so abun- 
dant in many of the ganites of that region. I have prepared thin sec- 



138 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

tions of these, together with a considerable number collected by myself, 
and submitted them to microscopic examination, in order to ascertain 
their composition in comparison with the rock in which they are con- 
tained. The results of the examination are given below. It may be well 
to state that all the granites spoken of bear biotite as their character- 
izing accessory and without exception contain together with ortho- 
clase a varying amount of an undetermined triclinic feldspar. These 
nodules are of all sizes from that of a filbert to a foot in diameter, of a 
color varying from light bluish-gray to almost perfectly black, and of a 
texture usually too fine to allow a certain determination of their min- 
eral composition by the unaided eye. They are commonly oval in shape, 
though angular forms are not rare. In definiteness of outline they vary 
considerably. In a few cases the fine black material blends gradually 
into the coarser material of the surrounding rock without sharp lines of 
demarkation. In others again the line of separation is so complete as 
to leave a distinct groove, easily traceable with the point of a knife. 
In the most cases, however, although the separation is as sharp as the 
granular structure of the rock will permit, there is no abrupt liue of de- 
markation such as would lead one to suppose them to be foreign bodies 
taken up by the granite»wkile in a plastic state. They show no tend- 
ency to separate from the matrix, but possess the same amount of tenac- 
ity at their line of contact as elsewhere. These spots are so abundant 
in many of the Maine rocks as to be a serious drawback to their exten- 
sive use for architectural purposes. As they are fine grained and take 
a good polish, they might not at all times be considered as particularly 
objectionable in polished work, but for the fact that owing to the largo 
proportion of mica they contain they weather more rapidly than the 
inclosing granite, and thus after a short time greatly mar the beauty 
of the stone. On bush-hammered and other rough-finished surfaces 
they appear as irregular dark blotches that are very unsightly. 

Jonesboro. — The granite quarried at Jonesboro is a coarse red rock, 
quite poor in mica, of even texture, compact, and hard. Under the 
microscope a part of the biotite is seen to have altered into a greenish 
chloritic product, while a few small apatite and zircon crystals, together 
with scattering grains of magnetite and sphene, are brought to view. 
The feldspars, as is usual in red granites, are found to be quite opaque. 
Dark patches in the rock are not particularly abundant, and I have ex- 
amined but few. These are oval in shape, from one to three inches in 
diameter, of a bluish-gray color, very fine grained, and quite hard. Their 
outlines are usually quite well defined. 

Under the microscope these are seen to be largely feldspathic in com- 
position, the crystals in polarized light often showing a somewhat radial 
arrangement. They are quite impure. The fine, even texture of the 
nodule is sometimes broken by the presence of larger crystals of a 
plagioclastic feldspar, which are of particular interest, since their angles 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 135J 

and corners are often greatly rounded and the crystals reduced to mere 
oval grains. These rounded crystals are quite small, being only from 
l mm to 4 n,m in length. The mica, as seen in the section, is in part biotite 
of the ordinary yellowish brown color; in part a colorless variety, oc- 
curring in small slender laminae which are often arranged in fan-shaped 
forms, or again in part a green chlorite, with the characteristic fibrous 
radiated structure. A few grains of pyrite are present, together with 
some epidote and numerous grains of magnetite. The quartz granules 
are frequently pierced by small colorless microlites, which could not be 
accurately determined. 

Sullivan. — The Sullivan granite is a coarse, gray rock, containing, 
so far as observed, but few accessory minerals, a few small crystals of 
magnetite, apatite, and zircon only being visible under the microscope. 
Dark nodules are very abundant in this rock, and I have examined a 
considerable number. As a whole, these are very fine and compact, 
with outlines well defined. By the microscope they are seen to be com- 
posed of essentially the same minerals as the surrounding granite, but 
in varying proportions and in a more finely divided state. But little 
quartz is present, while the feldspar is largely triclinic, sometimes show- 
ing a well-defined zonary structure. In all biotite is very abundant, 
frequently obscuring all other ingredients. Magnetite, in the form of 
small rounded grains, is usually very plentiful, together with very many 
colorless microlites such as were noticed in the Jonesboro rock. One 
of the inclusions in this rock is of so peculiar an appearance as to merit 
special attention. In size it is about 2 inches square and G inches long, 
with sharp angles and corners. On three sides and the ends, although 
the line of demarkation is perfectly sharp and runs in nearly straight 
lines, still there is no perceptible separation between the inclusion and 
the enclosing granite, the contact apparently being perfect. On the 
fourth side, however, there is a distinct groove traceable with a knife- 
point for several inches, as though the imperfect fluidity of the granitic 
mass had prevented its completely enveloping it. I can conceive, how- 
ever, that this effect may have been produced by weathering, as this 
side was exposed at the time of my finding the specimen. The texture 
of this specimen is too fine to allow any determination of its composi- 
tion by the naked eye. In color it is almost perfectly black. In thin 
sections the composition is found to be quite simple, consisting of mica 
scales and magnetite granules, so abundant as at times to almost en- 
tirely obscure all other ingredients. But little quartz is to be seen, and 
the feldspar is largely a triclinic variety. 

Mount Desert.— The rock quarried at Somesville, Mount Desert, 
is a coarse pinkish gray granite, in which much of the mica is of a 
greenish color, apparently of a chloritic or talcose nature. Magnetite, 
apatite, zircon, and sphene occur as accessories. The dark nodules in 
this rock closely resemble those iu that of Jonesboro. The larger 
grains that lie imbedded in the even gray groundmass of the inclusion 



140 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

are, however, iu this case quartz, and not feldspar. The proportion of 
green mica in the inclusion is much greater than in the granite proper, 
and the colorless microlites are here again abundant. It presents no 
other new features. 

East Blue Hill. — This is a coarse rock in which large snow-white 
crystals of orthoclase of an inch or more in length, twinned after the 
Carlsbad law, are frequently developed, giving the rock a beautiful por- 
phyritic structure. Muscovite, magnetite, and zircons are the more com- 
mon accessories. The biotite usually occurs in reddish-brown laminae, 
which are frequently surrounded by a black border of magnetite grains. 
Often, however, it is found altered into a chloritic product, enclosing 
very many small perfect crystals of the magnetite. Black nodules in 
this rock are, so far as my experience goes, very irregular in outline, 
small in size, and quite black. Under the microscope they are found 
to contain the same deep reddish-brown and green mica, enclosing grains 
of magnetite, as does the surrounding granite. There is a very evident 
iDcrease in the proportional amount of feldspar, and a corresponding 
diminution in the amount of quartz. 

Mount Waldo. — This is a coarse, gray rock, much resembling the 
last mentioned. The feldspar is in part microcline, and the usual amount 
of apatite and magnetite is present. The nodules in this granite are 
said to be quite abundant, though I have been able to obtain but few, 
one only of which needs especial mention. This is oval in shape, about 
1£ by 3 inches in size, of firm texture, and dark gray in color. Almost 
exactly in the center of the fine homogeneous mass of the nodule is a 
large crystal of microcline, some half an inch in diameter. Its angles 
are quite sharp. The finer surrounding material is composed of quartz, 
orthoclase, microcline, biotite, apatite, and magnetite in about the usual 
proportions of the granite, though in a more finely divided state. Color- 
less microlites also occur in these inclusions. 

Hurricane Island. — In the Hurricane Island rock the feldspar is 
nearly all orthoclase, though under the microscope a few crystals of a 
plagioclastic variety are seen. Some hornblende is present, though not 
enough to be macroscopically evident. The nodules in this rock are 
quite abundant, and I have examined a considerable number. These 
are usually quite black and of a fine, homogeneous texture. Their out- 
lines are well defined, showing under the microscope an abrupt transi- 
tion from the ordinary coarse texture of the granite to the finer-grained 
inclusion. There is, however, no tendency to separation along this line 
of contact ; a thin section of the rock made to include portions of both 
granite and inclusion, after being ground to a thinness of one four hun- 
dredth of an inch, being transferred to the mounting slide without diffi- 
culty. Under the microscope the fine-grained portion is found to con- 
sist of hornblende and biotite in about equal proportion, and in great 
abundance, together with varying amounts of quartz and feldspar. The 
proportion of quartz varies in different inclusions. Sometimes it is quite 



PROCEEDINGS OP UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 141 

abundant, and again it is almost entirely absent. Of the feldspars the 
triclinic variety is usually in excess. Tbe chief point of note in this case 
is that the hornblende and plagioclase occur in much larger proportion 
in the inclusions than in the granite proper. There are also found in 
this rock narrow vein-like inclusions which are light gray in color, of 
fine texture, and very hard and compact. These consist of quartz and 
feldspar, with only rarely a shred of mica and hornblende, or grain of 
magnetite. 

Vinal, Haven. — The Vinal Haven rock is of much finer texture than 
that of Hurricane Island, and contains a larger proportion of plagioclase. 
It contains a little hornblende, though in very sparing quantity. Ac- 
cessories are not abundant. Small crystals of sphene are occasionally 
found, occurring in close contact with the mica laminse, but they are not 
plentiful. I have seen but few inclusions from this locality, and they 
differ from the containing granite only in their finer texture and perhaps 
increased proportions of feldspar. The vein-like inclusions noticed in 
the Hurricane Island rock occur also here, and are of the same com- 
position. 

Biddeford. — I have seen but two of the nodules in these granites. 
They differ from the inclosing rock only in their finer texture, increased 
proportion of biotite, and perhaps sligbt diminution in the proportional 
amount of quartz. 

The results of the examination may be briefly summarized as follows: 
The nodules differ from the surrounding rock in their increased propor- 
tional amounts of biotite, or hornblende, and magnetite. In the majority 
of cases there is also an increase in the amount of feldspar, chiefly a 
triclinic variety, and a corresponding diminution in the amount of quartz. 
This, however, is not invariably the case. With the exception of tbe 
colorless needle-like crystals, they in no case contain minerals not found 
in the enclosing granite. These results agree closely with those of Mr. 
J. A. Phillips,* who has examined similar formations in granites of other 
localities, and who considers them as of concretionary origin ; "as the 
result of an abnormal arrangement of tbe minerals constituting the 
granite itself."

DESCRIPTION OF TWO NEW SPECIES OF FISHES (APRION ARIOITI- 
OTUS AND OPIIIDHJUI REANI) FROM PENSACOEA, FLORIDA. 

By DAVID S. JORDAN and CHARLES II. GILBERT. 

1. Aprion ariommus sp. no v. 

Head 3£ in length to base of caudal ; depth, 3f. D. XI, 11 ; A. Ill, 8. 
Lateral line with about 60 tubes, the number of transverse series of 
scales being about 70 ; about 7 scales between first dorsal spine and 
lateral line. 

Body elliptical, rather elongate, moderately compressed, highest near 
the front of the dorsal, the anterior profile regularly and not rapidly 
declined. Snout short, 4 J in head, the premaxillaries in front being 
about on the level of the middle of the eye. Mouth oblique, the lower 
jaw slightly projecting; maxillary reaching about to front of pupil, 
2i in head; maxillary naked, striate, without supplemental bone, slip- 
ping under the edge of the narrow, entire preorbital. 

Jaws each with a moderate band of villiform teeth, those of the outer 
series enlarged, especially above, none of the teeth distinctly canine 
like. Vomer, palatines, and tongue with bands of villiform teeth, those 
on the vomer in a long, somewhat arrow-shaped patch, being prolonged 
far backward on the median line, as in many species of Lutjanus; teeth 
on the tongue in two patches, a small one before a large one. Lower 
jaw thin, without evident pores. 

Eye very large, 2| in head. Interorbital space flattish, If in eye. 
Occipital crest rather low, thin, and sharp. Preopercle sharply toothed, 
the teeth near the angle sharp and straight, directed backward, the 
teeth on posterior limb directed upward. No notch above angle of pre- 
opercle. Opercle ending in two flat points, between which is an emar- 
gination. Suprascapula strongly serrate. 

Gill-rakers long and strong. Pseudobranchire large. 

Scales small, ctenoid, those above lateral line in very oblique series, 
not at all parallel with the lateral line, those below the lateral line form- 
ing curved series, which are convex downwards. Bases of soft dorsal 
and anal naked. Pectoral without axillary scale. 

Dorsal moderately but not deeply notched ; the spines rather strong, 
not very unequal, the longest (fourth) about 2£ in head. Caudal long, 
rather deeply forked, its lobes about 1£ in head. Anal spines short, the 
second longest 3£ in head. Pectorals long, If in head. Tentrals, 1 J. 

Color in spirits silvery white, perhaps rosy in life. Sides with faint, 
dark olive, narrow, undulating streaks which follow the direction of the

Two specimens of this species, each about six inches long, were ob- 
tained by Mr. Silas Stearns from the stomachs of red snappers (Lutjanus 
blackfordi Goode & Beau) on the " Snapper Banks " off Pensacola. Both

are in bad condition, parts of the body having been injured by the di- 
gestive process. There is apparently no doubt that the present species 
belongs to the genus Aprion, as understood by Bleecker (=ApsiluSj Glue- 
topterus, Pristipomoides, Sparopsis, and Platyinius of authors). It does 
not, however, seem to be very closely related to any of the other species 
known. 

Several other interesting species are in the collection of which these 
specimens form a part. The following list includes those which were 
taken from the stomachs of the snappers : 

Ophichthys sclineideri Steindachner. 

The remains referred by us (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1882, 260) to 

Ophiclitliys mordax belong to this species. It is doubtful whether 

0. punctifer (= mordax) has yet been taken on the United States 

coast. 
Leptoceplialus caudicula (Bean) J. & G. 
Myrophis ? microstigmius Poey (very bad condition). 
Etrumeus teres (Dekay) Bleecker. 
Synodus intermedins (Spix) Poey. 
Exocwtus mesogaster Bloch. ( = E. hillianus Gosse). 
Trichiurus leplnrus L. 
Scomber colias Gmelin. 
Trachurus saurus Baf. 
Serranus philadelphicus (L.) J. & G. 
Aprion ariommus Jor. & Gilb. 

Platyglossus radiatus (L.) Jor. & Gilb. ( = P. florealis J. & G.). 
Vlatyglossus caudalis (L.) Giinther. 
Xyrichthys lineatus (Gmel.) J. & G. (nee C. & V.). 
Ophidium marginatum Dek. 

(=? Ophidium josephi Grd. ? O. graellsi, Poey, nee Jor. & Gilb.). 

Emblemaria Bean, MSS. 
Opisthognathus lonchurus Jor. & Gilb. 
Hemirhombus pcetulus Bean. 

2. Ophidium beani sp. nov. (30868). 

(= Ophidiwm graiillsi Jordan & Gilbert, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1882, 31.) 

In our previous paper on the fishes of Pensacola, we referred two 
specimens (308G8) of an Ophidium from the stomach of a red snapper to 
Ophidium graellsi, of Poey, in spite of several important discrepancies. 
We have lately received from Pensacola a specimen of an Ophidium 
which agrees fully with Poey's description, and which is evidently very 
different from the fish at first called graellsi by us. This species we 
cannot distinguish from 0. marginatum Dekay (already known from 
Charleston) nor from 0. josephi Girard, known from the coast of Texas. 
We may therefore provisionally consider 0. marginatum, 0. josephi, and 
0. graellsi as identical, while the fish called by us 0. graellsi may receive a 



144 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

new name (Ophidium beani), in honor of our excellent friend the Curator 
of Ichthyology in the National Museum. 0. beani agrees with 0. holbrooki 
Putnam, in the long and tapering air-bladder, but differs in the much 
longer head (6 in length in 0. Iwlbroolti). In 0. marginatum, the air- 
bladder is ovate, truncate behind. Its form is not mentioned in the 
descriptions of 0. graellsi and O.josephi.

ON THE PROBABIiE IDENTITY OF MOTACILLA OCULARIS SWIIV- 
HOE AND M. AMURENSIS SEEBOHTI, WITH REMARKS ON AN 

ALLIED SUPPOSED SPECIES, M. BIAKISTONI SEEBOHM. 

By ROBERT BIDGWAY. 

The Pied Wagtails of Eastern Asia have given much trouble, as the 
numerous papers in the Ibis and Proceedings of the London Zoological 
Society, by Mr. Swinhoe, Mr. Seebohm, and others, testify. In a recent 
article in the first-named journal (in the number for January, 1883, pp. 
90-92) the latter author gives some " Observations on the Pied Wagtails 
of Japan," in which is described a supposed new species (M. blahistoni) 
breeding in the Kurile Islands, South Yesso, and Askold, and conclud-

The material in the National Museum is not what could be desired, 
and is by no means so extensive as that upon which Mr. Seebohm's 
observations are based. Nevertheless, the series includes specimens 
which throw much light upon the subject, to the extent, in fact, of con- 
clusively proving that, either it is only the summer adult male of M. 
amurensis which has the back black, while the fully adult female is undis- 
tinguishable from M . ocularis, or, else, that these two birds are identical, 
the former representing the adult male, and the latter the adult female, 
or perhaps, in winter, both sexes. The specimens which render this fact 
perfectly obvious are a series of five skins collected by Dr. L. Stejneger r 
of the United States Signal Service, on Bering Island and at Petropau- 
lovski, Kamtschatka (one only from the latter locality). This series in- 
cludes two males and three females (the sex of one of the latter conject- 
ural, however*), the former being typical ocularis and the latter equally 
typical " amurensis. P There can be no doubt that they represent oppo- 
site sexes of the same species, having been obtained together, the duties 
being from May 11 to June 27. 

Granting that the gray-backed specimens hereinafter to be described 
really represent the M. ocularis of Swinhoe (and they agree in the

the sex, his invariable practice being to mark the sex only when determined by dis- 
section.

A specimen from Plover Bay, Siberia, obtained in fall or winter (No. 
57977, Capt. C. M. Scammon, collector), agrees pretty closely with the 
La Paz specimen described above, but is decidedly more brownish-gray 
above, while the black of the jugnlnm extends farther up on the throat. 
Wing 3.50, tail 4. 

An example, from China, of what appears to be this species, differs 
from the two described above in the wing-markings, the middle coverts 
being dusky, tipped with white, the greater wing-coverts also dusky and 
narrowly edged with dull grayish, but without white, even at tips. The 
head-markings, however, are precisely identical, and it maybe merely a 
a younger individual. Wing 3.70, tail 3.80. 

Mr. Seebohm's M. blaldstoni is said to differ from M. u amuremis v ( $ ) 
only in having black lesser wing-coverts and white secondaries, these 
parts being, respectively, ash-gray and brownish-gray in M. ll amurensis." 
Is it not possible, therefore, that M. blaldstoni merely represents the per- 
fectly developed plumage of the adult $ of M. " amurensis" {—ocularis)% 



THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF FSECDOTRIACIS MICBODON, CA- 

PELLO, OIV THE COAST OF THE UNITED STATES. 

By TABLETON II. BEAN. 

The United States National Museum has just received, in the fresh 
state, aline example of a species of Pseudotriacis, which came ashore 
at the Auiagausett Life-Saviug station on Long Island, February 8, 1883. 

This shark is the first result of a request by Prof. S. F. Baird to the 
Superintendent of life-saving stations, Mr. S. I. Kimball, for information 
from points along the entire coast concerning the movements of marine 
animals and for the sending of such specimens to the National Museum 
as it may be desirable to possess. The example here described was for- 
warded by Mr. J. B. Edwards, keeper of the Suffolk life-saving station, 
February 12, 1883. 

No species of the genus Psendotriacis has heretofore been recorded 
in the western Atlantic. The genus was first made known by Capello,* 
who had the single discovered species, P. microdon, from the coast of 
Portugal. A figure of the species is published in the journal referred 
to on Plate 5. An examination of the description and figure leaves no 
doubt in my mind that our example is identical with Capello's species. 
Owing to the extreme rarity of this shark a full description and table 
of measurements may prove interesting. 

PSEUDOTRIACIS Capello. 

Body elongate ; mouth wide, with a very short labial fold around the 
angle; snout depressed, rounded, moderately long; nostrils inferior, 
near the mouth, but not coufluent with it ; eyes oblong, lateral, without 

*Capello : Jorn. Sc. Math. Phys. e nat. Lisboa, t. I, 1868, p. 321, pi. V. 



148 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

nictitating membrane; spiracles well developed behind the eye; gill- 
openings moderate, in advance of the pectoral; jaws armed with numer- 
ous rows of small, tricuspid teeth ; first dorsal fin, opposite the space 
between pectorals and ventrals, long and low, gradually increasing in 
height posteriorly; second dorsal behind ventrals, opposite and similar 
to anal; ventrals and pectorals well developed; no pit at the root of 
caudal fin, the basal lobe of which is very low and long ; skin with mi- 
nute asperities. 

The genus Pseudotriacis was provisionally referred to the family Scyl- 
Uidce, in which it properly belongs. 

Pseudotriacis microdon Capello. 

The greatest height of the body is at the origin of the first dorsal ; 
it is contained 8? times in the total length. The height at the origin of 
ventrals is contained <>.] times in total length. The height of head at 
the first gill-opening is a little greater than that of body at the ventral 
origin, while the height of the head at the angle of the mouth is a little 
less than one-eleventh of the total length. The least height of the tail 
equals the height of the anal, and is contained 25 times in total 
length. 

The head is somewhat depressed in front, with moderately sharp 
snout, which is nearly twice as long as the distance of its tip from the 
mouth. The distance from snout to last gill-opening is contained 5 
times in total length. The distance from snout to first gill-opening, 
measured horizontally, equals twice the height of body at origin of sec- 
ond dorsal. The distance between the first and last gill-openings equals 
nearly twice the length of the eye. The height of the first gill-opening 
is about equal to the distance between the angle of the mouth and the 
spiracle. The height of the head at angle of mouth is contained 11 
times and at the first gill-opening 9 times in total length. The length 
of the snout equals one-half the body height at origin of first dorsal. 
The distance of mouth from snout, measured on the axis of the fish, 
equals one-third width of mouth. The distance from snout to angle of 
mouth, obliquely taken, equals one-fourth the distance from snout to 
last gill-opening. The distance between eye and spiracle equals that 
from mouth to nostril. The distance from angle of mouth to spiracle is 
about equal to height of first gill-opening. The spiracle is moderately 
large, the length of its opening being contained twice in the height of 
fourth gill-opening. The oblong eye is placed near the dorsal profile ; 
the length of the orbit is about one-half the greatest height of second 
dorsal; the length of the eye equals about one-fourth width of mouth. 
The length of upper jaw is slightly more than that of lower, and nearly 
equals the distance between the spiracles. The distance from the mouth 
to the nostril is about one-fourth least height of tail ; the distance be 
tween nostrils equals 4 times the distance from eye to spiracle. The 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 149 

interorbital space equals one-half the length of second dorsal base. The 
distance between the spiracles equals 4 times their greatest length. 

The first dorsal is very long and low, highest behind its middle, the 
length of its base equal to 7 times its greatest height; its distance 
from the snout is a little more than twice the greatest length of pecto- 
ral. The second dorsal is distant from the end of the first a length 
equal to nearly twice its greatest height ; the length of its base is some- 
what more than the body height at origin of first dorsal. 

The second dorsal begins at a distance from the end of the first, which 
is equal to the height of body at ventral origin ; the length of its base 
equals twice the interorbital distance ; its height equals nearly twice 
the length of the orbit. 

The anal is entirely under the second dorsal, but its base is a little 
less than five-sevenths as long as that of the latter ; the greatest height 
of the anal equals the least height of caudal peduncle. 

The caudal originates at a distance from the end of the second dorsal 
about equal to the height of the anal ; it is divided by a notch into a 
short upper portion, whose length is very little more than the greatest 
height of first dorsal, and a very low and long lower portion, the long- 
est margin of which is nearly twice as long as the snout. The distance 
of the caudal from the end of anal base equals one-fourth the length of 
second dorsal base. 

The distance of pectoral from snout is contained 5 times in total 
length ; the length of pectoral equals nearly twice the Avidth of its base, 
and is a little more than one-ninth of total length. The greatest width 
of pectoral equals twice the height of anal, and is contained twelve and 
one-third times in total length. 

The origin of the ventral is slightly in advance of the end of first dor- 
sal, and is behind the middle of total length a distance equal to the in- 
terorbital space. The length of ventral equals that of lower jaw. The 
width of ventral base equals that of pectoral base; the greatest width 
of ventral slightly exceeds its length. 

Color. — When received the margins of the fins were apparently faded; 
the original color was probably grayish-brown with dark margins on 
all the fins except the first dorsal. Capello states that his example was 
chestnut-brown. 

Remarks. — The gills and mouth were obstructed by sand. The only 
parasites discovered on the animal were a couple of isopods, one of 
which was found in the eye cavity.

ON A PAIR OF ABNORMAL. ANTLERS OF THE VIRGINIA DEER. 
By FREDERICK W. TREE. 

The Museum received from Mr. John M. Forbes, some four months 
ago, apairof antlers of the Virginia deer ( Gervus virginianus), which pre- 
seut au interesting malformation. The auimal to which the antlers be- 
longed formed one of the herd kept in park on Naushon Island (Eliza- 
beth Isles), Massachusetts. 

The left antler is perfectly normal. It has the usual tynes, four in 
number, in the normal positions, and not peculiar either in length or 
shape. The right antler, on the contrary, bears only the 
brow-tyne, which, although of the usual length, occupies 
a position on the anterior side of the beam, so that the 
outlines of tyne and beam are best seen when the skull 
is viewed in profile. From the base of the tyne the beam 
rises parallel to the latter for about one-third its length, 
and then bends backward, forming an obtuse angle. Its 
outline is undulatory, and throughout the superior third 
the surface is smooth ; the tip is as acute as that of the 
brow-tyne. 

The entire length of the antler is 13.6 inches ; from 
the burr to the base of the brow-tyne, 4.5 inches ; length 
of the brow-tyne 5.2 inches ; greatest width of beam and 
tyne at the base of the latter, 2.9 inches. 

There is nothing in the form or structure of this antler 
to suggest injury by accident or disease. 

The investigations of Professor Baird and Mr. Caton 
upon the CervidaB of North America show that similar 
cases are not rare. Of the Virginia deer, Professor Baird 
writes : " Sometimes a perfectly adult, fullgrown male will have but a 
single slender spike, thus resembling a buck of the second year."* Mr. 
Caton's allusion is to deer antlers in general. " Usually," he states, 
"the first antler grown on the young buck is not branched, but consists 
of beam only, and is called a dag or spike antler, and the latter term ap- 
plies to the antlers of the adults when they are not branched, which is 
sometimes the case."t 

Conditions exactly opposed to those which I have reported above, 
have been very recently noted by J. S. Cockburn as occurring in a speci- 
men of the Porcine deer [Hyelaphv& porcinus).^ 

I am indebted to Mr. F. A. Lucas for the drawing accompanying this 
note.

DESCRIPTION OF IVEW SPECIES OF REPTILES IN THE IMTE» 
STATES NATIONAL. MISELM. 

By II. C. YARROW, M. ». (Univ. of IVitn. , 

Honorary Curator of Reptiles. 
EUTJENIA VAGKANS PLUTONIA, subspecies UOV. 

This subspecies resembles E. vagrans angustirostris, but may be dis- 
tinguished by the characters given below. 

Body very short when compared with length. Tail more than one- 
quarter total length. Head short and broad, snout blunt, not long and 
narrow as in E. vagrans angustirostris. Crown flat above. Eye small, 
directly over the fourth and fifth upper labials; upper labials eight, 
the sixth a third larger than the seventh ; eighth small and triangular. 
Lower labials ten, sixth largest; one large anteorbital, three postorbitals. 
Mouth deeply cleft. Prefrontals triangular, postfrontals broader than 
long, verticals and occipitals about the same as in E. vagrans angustiros- 
tris. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-one, outer row smooth, a few showing 
traces of slight cariuation, but not so much as do the upper rows, the 
keeling increasing towards the dorsal ridge. An ivory-white dorsal 
band, eight scales wide, commences four scales posterior to hinder mar- 
gin of verticals, becoming narrower as it extends towards the tail; no 
traces of it can be seen on the lower third of the body. On both sides 
are indistinct and broken lateral lines, which commence five scales pos- 
terior to the angle of the jaw on the third and fourth rows of scales, then 
drop to the second and third rows of scales. These lateral lines in some 
places appear to be double. Below the lateral lines many of the blue- 
black scales are margined with white. Color above blue-black, with an 
ashy tint, due to a sprinkling of whitish dots on many scales. The upper 
border of the ventral scales, below the first row of dorsal and lateral 
scales, is blue-black, the centers greenish-white; many of them are mac- 
ulated with black anteriorly. Length of specimen 2 feet 1 inch. This 
specimen was seen some years since by Professor Cope, who suggested 
the name which has been given to it.

Eut^enia Henshawi, species nov. 

Among the many very valuable specimens of reptiles sent to the Na- 
tional Museum by Capt. C. Bendire, U. S. A., is one new species for 
which the above name is suggested. 

Head rather broad and short, mouth deeply cleft. Eye large, over 
fourth and fifth upper labials. Verticals longer than broad; eight upper 
labials, six and seven of same size; ten lower labials; twenty-one rows 
of scales, first not carinated except on lower third of body, and then

very faintly ; second row faintly carinated. Carination strongly marked 
on three dorsal rows of scales, particularly near the tail. One anteorbi- 
tal ; three postorbitals. A dorsal line extends to the tip of the tail, and 
with a glass indications of lateral lines may be seen on the second and 
one-half of the third rows of lateral scales. These are so faintly marked 
as only to be noticed by careful scrutiny. Color blue-black above, no 
spots, belly greenish-olive, not black-spotted. Kesembles the E. couchi, 
described by Kenuicott in Pacific Railroad Survey Reports, Vol. X, p. 
10, but differs in the appearance of the head. The general coloration is

Bascanium flagelliforme bicinctum, subspecies nov. 

In a collection of reptiles from Old Fort Cobb, Tex., made by Dr. E. 
Palmer, is a serpent which resembles very nearly B. flag, testaccum, but 
differs in some particulars. The above name is provisionally adopted. 

Scales of head normal, with exception of vertical, which is slightly 
contracted at middle third. Center of the eye a little behind junction of 
fourth and fifth upper labials. Seventh upper labial longest and broad- 
est. The most marked difference from the species named is in the colora- 
tion and markings. General color above rusty brown, anterior margin 
of scales, if skin is stretched, marked with bluish-black. Traces of two 
yellowish lines on both sides of body at last row of lateral scales. Ab- 
dominal scutellre on upper third of body black spotted, with double 
series on each scale. These markings become obsolete near the tail. 
The chin yellow, ante and post orbitals same color. Upon the head at 
the posterior margin of superciliaries and the vertical is a faint trace of 
a blackish transverse line. The base of the occipitals is similarly col- 
ored, and directly behind is a transverse black band four scales witle 
passing around the back of the neck, terminating just behind the pos- 
terior borders of the last upper labials. Five scales posterior to this 
band is another, two scales in width descending as low as the former. 
The interval between the two bands is lighter than the rest of the body 
color. At first sight the band reminds one of a characteristic of the 
ringed-neck Diadophis. I have examined many specimens of Basca- 
nium and failed to find any traces of the nuchal ring found in the 
above-named species. 

The specimen is half grown, and measures 1 foot 5.1 inches in length.

Tropidonotus compressicaudus walkeri, subspecies 110V. 

In a collection of reptiles sent from Florida by Mr. S. T. Walker is 
a Tropidonotus which differs so markedly in coloration from anything 
in the reserve series of the National Museum that the above name is 
proposed for it. 

Body short, form triangular,, somewhat compressed towards the tail. 
Head deep, broad, and short. Postfrontals very large, vertical long and 
narrow, occipitals large. One anteorbital, three postorbitals, the lower 
angle of the central one being prolonged to touch the sixth upper labial. 
Eight upper labials on each side, sixth and seventh about the same size. 
Twenty-two rows of scales, the first and second faintly the rest strongly 
carinated. Ground color, yellowish-olive, two black bands on neck, 
behind which are zigzag transverse blackish bands which continue down 
the body to the end of the tail. 

It will be seen from this description that the subspecies under con- 
sideration resembles in a very marked degree Kennicott's Tropidonotus 
compressicaudus, but differs in having a larger and narrower vertical, 
one more row of scales, and in shape of head. So tar as pattern and 
coloration are considered, they are precisely as described by Kennicott in 
T. compressicaudus, with the exception that there are two stripes on 
the neck, not four, and that the zigzag bands in the present species 
taper at the sides, and continue to end of tail, not breaking up into spots. 

The subspecies is named iu houor of Mr. S. T. Walker, who has for- 
warded many valuable specimens to the National Museum.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SOUIE NEW BIRDS FROII LOWER CALIFORNIA, 
COLLECTED BY MR. L. BELDINO. 

By ROBERT RIDGWAY. 

1. Lophophanes inoriiatus cineraceus. Ashy Titmouse. 

Subsp. cn. — Adult $ (No. 89800, Laguna, Lower California, Febru- 
ary 2, 1883; L. Belding) : Above ashy-gray, slightly tinged with olive, 
especially on the rump; sides of head and neck paler ashy, gradually 
fading into whitish-gray on lores, cheeks, chin, throat, and jugulum; 
other lower parts grayish-white, the sides and crissum slightly tinged 
with brownish. Bill and feet black (dark plumbeous in life 1 ?). Wing 
2.80, tail 2.50, culmen 38, depth of bill at base .20, tarsus .75, middle 
toe .50. 

This local race of L. inomatus is even more decidedly gray above than 
the Middle Province form (L. inomatus griseus), characterized iu volume 
5 of these Proceedings (page 344). It is likewise much paler colored

beneath, the lower parts appearing almost white (the belly quite so) 
on comparison. The bill is likewise much smaller and apparently quite 
different in color, being uniform deep-black in the type specimen, 
whereas in (/risen* (as well as in inornatus proper) it is horn-colored. 
Typical inornatus is equally light-colored beneath, but the upper parts 
are very different, being olive-brown instead of ashy-gray. 

2. Psaltriparus grindae, Belding, MS. Grixda's Titmouse. 

Sp. oh. — Adult (No. 89801, Laguna, Lower California, February 2, 
1S83) : Entire pileum uniform light brown, or isabella-color (exactly as 
in some specimens of P. minim us); side of head similar, but paler, and 
gradually fading into white on chin and throat; remaining lower parts 
very pale smoky-gray, with a faint lilac tinge (exactly as in P. minimus). 
Upper parts light plumbeous-gray, in very marked and abrupt con- 
trast with the brown of the nape. Bill, legs, and feet deep black. 
Wing 2, tail 2.30, the outer feather .50 of an inch shorter ; culmen 
.20, depth of bill at base .11', tarsus .00, middle toe .30. 

This pretty new species, while combining, to a certain degree, the 
characters of P. minimus and P. plumbeus, is yet apparently quite dis- 
tinct from both. In the brown head and color of the under parts it 
agrees exactly with the former, but the resemblance ends there. From 
the latter it differs in much whiter throat and decidedly clearer, more 
bluish, shade of the upper parts, in both of which respects there is a 
close resemblance to P. melanotis. The bill is very slender, like that of 
P. plumbeus. 

" I take much pleasure in dedicating this species in honor of my good 
friend Sr. Don Francisco C. Grinda, of La Paz, as a slight token of my 
appreciation of his generous impulses and gentlemanly qualities of head 
and heart. — L. B." 

3. Junco bairdi, Beldiug, MS. Baird's Snowbird. 

Sp. cii. — Adult: Head and neck ash-gray, gradually lightening into 
very pale ashy on the throat, the occiput and nape somewhat tinged 
with brown; lores blackish, in distinct contrast. Lack, scapulars, 
upper (or inner) greater wing-coverts and tertials dull light rufous- 
brown, somewhat tinged with olive; rump and upper tail-coverts gray- 
ish olive, or light grayish-brown, as are also the lesser, middle, and lower 
(outer) greater wing-coverts; primaries more gray, edged with paler, 
the outermost white on the margin ; inner webs of tertials dusky. Tail 
dusky grayish olive-brown, the exterior feather chiefly white, the next 
with nearly the terminal half white next the shaft, the third with or 
without a small terminal white spot. Jugulum very pale buffy-grayish, 
in rather abrupt, though not pronounced, contrast with the white of the 
abdomen; entire sides and flanks deep cinnamon-buff; crissum dull 
white. Maxilla dark brown (not black), mandible ''bright yellow"; iris 
i l color of ripe oranges "or "bright yellow"; legs and feet pale brown

in the dried skin. Wing 2.75-2.80, tail 2.70-2.80, culraen .40-.41, depth 
of bill through base .2o, tarsus .80, middle toe .52-.5o. 

Types, Nos. 89811 $ ad., and S9810 (sex not determined), Laguna, 
Lower California, February 2, 1883 5 L. Belding. 

This pretty and very distinct species is perhaps most nearly related 
to J. insularis, of Guadalupe Island, but differs in much brighter and 
more varied coloration, longer tail, and other differences of proportions. 
In general appearance there is a somewhat close resemblance, at first 
sight, to a very brightly-colored female J. oregonus, especially in the color 
of the back and sides, but it is the only one of the " pink-sided" group, 
having yellow eyes and mandible, the latter characters, as well as the 
pale color of the throat, allying it more closely to J. cinereus. It is so 
markedly distinct, however, from all its congeners as to really need no 
comparison with any of them. 

The species is dedicated by Mr. Belding to Professor Baird. 

March 9, 1883. 

Note. — Since the above was put in type, additional specimens of all 
these new birds have been received from Mr. Belding. Their charac- 
ters as already given require no modification. 



AIVTHUS CERVINUS (PALLAS)* JIV LOWER CALIFORNIA. 

By ROBERT RIDGWAY. 

In the collection of birds made by Mr. L. Belding in Lower Califor- 
nia, during the winter of 1882-'83, is a single specimen of an Anthus col- 
lected at San Jose del Cabo on the 26th of January, which was thought 
to be, and in fact was described in MS., as a new species, until three 
specimens of the same bird were found among a small lot from the 
coast of China, recently received at the National Museum from Mr. P. 
L. Jouy. These additional specimens naturally led to a further exami- 
nation of the type of the supposed new species, and the much-scattered 
literature pertaining to the Asiatic species of this genus, the result of

which was the discovery that the specimens in question were A. cervimts 
(Pall.), in winter plumage. 

As this species must now be added to the Xorth American fauna, a 
description is in order, and is accordingly presented herewith. 

Adult, winter plumage (No. 89799, San Jose del Cabo, January 2G, 1883) : 
Above light grayish olive-brown, everywhere very broadly and distinct ly 
si t caked with dusky, the streaks much broader, and nearly black, on the 
dorsal region; wings and tail brownish dusky, all the feathers edged 
with light brownish, the edge of the longer tertials pale buffy, and the 
terminal borders of the middle and greater wing-coverts nearly white; 
outer tail-feather with a considerable portion of the inner web white at 
end and along shaft, the middle portion of the outer web also whitish ; 
next leather with a white spot at end of inner web. A pale superciliary 
stripe, becoming bright rufous-buff above eyes and auriculars ; a pale 
malar stripe, whitish anteriorly and posteriorly, but rufous-buff for about 
.20 of an inch in the middle portion; auriculars raw-umber brownish, 
paler in the middle portion (longitudinally). Lower parts dull white, 
tin' jugulum marked with very broad streaks, or longitudinal spots, 
of brownish-black, the breast, sides, and flanks with more lanceolate 
streaks of the same; chin immaculate, but throat sparsely marked 
with minute streaks, and bounded on each side by a distinct submalar 
stripe of aggregated blackish streaks; abdomen, anal region, and cris- 
suin immaculate bufl'y-white. Bill black, the basal third of the man- 
dible yellowish ; legs and feet uniform deep brown. Wing 3.30, first 
primary decidedly longest, the second and third equal, the fourth nearly 
.10 of an inch shorter; fifth .35 of an inch shorter than the fourth; ter- 
tials about .20 of an inch shorter than longest primary; tail 2.50, the 
intermedia^ about .10 of an inch shorter than lateral rectrices ; culmen 
.45, tarsus .85, middle toe .G5, hind toe .40, hind claw .40. 

The summer plumage is similar, except the entire chin and throat, 
together with other light markings about the head, are deep cinnamon- 
buff, or fawn-color. 

The Chinese specimens, above alluded to (Nos. 91810, '11, and 7 12, Mirs 
Bay, January 22, 1882), agree very closely with Mr. Belding's specimen. 
One of them, however (Xo. 91811), has scarcely a trace of the reddish 
on sides of head (present in both of the others), while the ground-color 
beneath has a slight sulphury-yellow tinge. 

In its winter plumage this species resembles somewhat A. pratensis in 
summer dress, but differs, among other particulars, in having the rump 
much less olivaceous, and very distinctly and broadly streaked. The 
measurements are quite similar.

NOTE OIV MERIIA CONFINIS (BAIBD). 
By ROBERT RIDOWAY. 

The type of this species, obtained by Xantus, in 1860, at Todos Santos, 
Lower California, has remained unique up to the present year. Two 
additional specimens, however, have lately been received at the National 
Museum from Mr. L. Belding, who has so ably supplemented the work 
done by Xantus in the vicinity of Cape St. Lucas;* and since consider- 
able doubt has been expressed by some authors as to the validity of the 
species, some remarks upon these additional specimens may not be un- 
acceptable. 

No. 8979G, adult (sex not determined), Laguna, February 1, 1883*: 
Very similar to the type, but lower parts even paler, the entire abdo- 
men, flanks, anal region, and crissum being white (the lower tail-coverts, 
however, mixed with bluish-gray, and the sides washed with the same) ; 
the ground-color of the breast and jugulum is exactly the same as in 
the type (rich creamy-buff), but this is more distinctly obscured by a 
gray clouding. The white superciliary stripe is very distinct, beginning 
above the lores and extending quite uninterruptedly over the eyes and 
auriculars, nearly or quite to the end of the latter. The bill is dark 
brown, with the edge of the maxilla and basal half (or more) of the man- 
dible yellow; the feet horn-brown. Wing .5.10, tail .4, culmen .85, tar- 
sus 1.20, middle toe .85. 

Xo. 89797, 9 ad., Laguna, February 3: This specimen is in very per- 
fect feather, and, so far as plumage is concerned, is almost a duplicate 
of the type. Owing to the more perfect condition of the feathers, how- 
ever, the colors are softer and somewhat richer, but the color of the 
jugulum, breast, sides, and lining of the wing is of an exactly similar 
creamy-buff, or soft creamy-ochraceous, the breast clouded with pale 



* Although but just commencing Lis secoucl season's work, Mr. Belding has already 
made several additions to the number of species known lo oe peculiar to Lower California 
at the conclusion of Xantus's explorations ; and when the objective point of his present 
trip, the pine-clad mountains of the interior, shall have been reached and thoroughly 
■worked, the number will no doubt be materially increased. The new species and races 
already discovered by Mr. Belding are the following: (1) Lophophancs inornatus cuiera- 
ceas, (2) Psallriparus grindOB, (3) Gcothlypis beldingi (see p. 344, vol. 5, «>!' these Pro- 
ceedings), (4) Junco bairdi, and (">) Rallus beldingi (vol. 5, p. 345). Xantus discovered 
altogether nine forms peculiar to the vicinity of the cape, as follows: (1) Merula con- 
finis, (2) Methriopterua cinereus, (3) Campylorhynchus nffinis, (4) Passerculus gutlatus 
(doubtful), (5) Pijrilo fusca albigula, (G) Basilinna xantusi, (?) Pious scalaria lucasanus, 
(8) Melanerpes formicivorus angusiafrone, and (9) Halocyptena microsomia, the latter, 
however, a pelagic bird, and therefore probably of wider distribution. In addition 
to those named above, Mr. Belding lias sent single skius of several forms which will 
prove to bo local races should additional examples agree with them in certain peculi- 
arities noted, while two Asiatic species (Motacilla ocularis and Anthus cervinus), besides 
a number of North American species, have been added to the Cane fauna.

gray to about the same extent as in the type. The superciliary stripe 
is very conspicuous and quite continuous. Bill and feet as in the pre- 
ceding. Wing 5.20, tail 4.15, culinen .SO, tarsus 1.25, middle toe .90. 

It thus appears that the characters of the species, as originally de- 
fined by Professor Baird (Eeview Am. Birds, p. 29), are not only quite 
constant but also very pronounced, so that there need be no further 
reason for denying it the specific rank to which it is clearly entitled.

PRELI.UL'VARV IVOTE ON THE CKVNTALLINE SCHISTS OF THE »IS- 
TRICT OF COLUMBIA. 

By GEOROE P. MERHILL. 

As is well known, the region about Washington, D. C, is very poor 
in crystalline rocks, they being confined entirely to that narrow portion 
of the District in the immediate vicinity of Bock Creek and the strip of 
country to the westward included between the creek and the Potomac 
Eiver. 

It is probably due largely to this poverty of material that these 
rocks have been so little studied, the only reference to the character of 
the formations that I am able to find dating back nearly fifty years. It 
is as follows : 

"Bock Creek and its immediate vicinity is the line between the prim- 
itive formation and the Tertiary. From Bock Creek up the Potomac 
the borders of the stream are pregnant with primitive rocks in situ and 
in bowlders, with the exception of a few small pieces of alluvial soil here 
and there in the valley of the river. This is the case for 20 miles 
or more, when the country changes to old red sandstone, which con- 
tinues 20 or 25 miles farther up the river, with occasional ridges of 
breccia, or pudding-stone. * * * About a mile, however, east of the 
entrance of Bock Creek into the Potomac, on the southern point of the 
city, near the glass-house, the final termination of the primitive rocks 
that line the bed and banks of the Potomac above clearly takes place. 
In digging wells beyond this point rocks seldom obtrude ; the alluvial 
soil everywhere prevails. Bock Creek separates the primitive from the 
alluvial soil. In the former gneiss abounds, which is succeeded by 
amphibolic rock, or griinstein. The gneiss contains small crystallized 
tubes of magnetic iron, veins of feldspar, and quartz of opaque white 
color. * * * The rock employed to form the foundation, or base, of 
the houses in Washington is a species of gneiss composed of feldspar, 
quartz, and mica, of a leafy texture owing to the abundance and dis- 
position of the mica. It contains primitive sulphurous iron, and also 
particles of the same metal which are attracted by the needle."* 

* From "A new and comprehensive Gazetteer of Virginia and the District of Colum- 
bia," ByJosiah Martin. Charlottesville, 1835. 



160 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

The general topography of the country as here given is, I believe, 
very nearly correct, and need not again be referred to, as it is with 
the lithological character of the formation only that this paper has to 
deal. The results here given are based upon microscopic examinations 
of thin sections prepared from material gathered by myself, and, though 
they may be subject to alteration on further study, seem at present to 
be conclusive. 

So far as my present experience goes, the prevailing and almost* only 
indigenous rock of the District is an extremely variable hornblendic, chlo- 
ritic, or micaceous schist, which sometimes becomes somewhat gneiss- 
oid in constitution through the presence of a small amount of a plagio- 
clastic feldspar. The finer varieties of the rock are much used for build- 
ing purposes, and make a fairly durable material. They are light-gray 
or slightly bluish in color, compact, and under the microscope are found 
to consist essentially of quartz and biotite, with but few accessories, 
among which a silvery-white mica, magnetite, and apatite are most 
abundant. The coarser varieties of the rock, however, presents a much 
more complex structure, containing frequently plagioclase (oligoclase ?), 
hornblende, chlorite, apatite, epidote, pyrite, magnetite, garnets, and 
rutile. The plagioclase occurs only in small, pure crystals, showing to 
good advantage the characteristic banding in polarized light. The 
quartz is as usual in irregular grains, and contains but few cavities, the 
moving bubbles so frequently seen in the quartz of granites being almost 
entirely wanting. The mica of all these schists is principally biotite, 
which is frequently more or less altered into a green chlorite. It bears 
numerous inclosures of apatite and magnetite, and occasionally there is 
present quite an amount of infiltrated calcite. This ordinarily appears 
as irregular grains, sometimes showing the characteristic rhombohedral 
cleavage and laminated structure in polarized light, or merely as minute 
silvery- white granules imbedded in the mica. 

Magnetite is quite abundant in some parts of the rock, as is also 
pyrite. The garnets, which are of frequent occurrence, are entirely 
devoid of crystalline outline, and are of light salmon color in thin sec- 
tions. They arc sometimes quite pure, or again contain numerous 
inclosures of quartz and magnetite. 

Apatite is abundant in small colorless prisms, usually showing one or 
more lines of fracture parallel to the base. The hornblende, when pres- 
ent, is usually in very imperfect crystals of a faint bluish or greenish 
color; it contains very many cavities and inclosures. Occasionally it is 
met with in the form of small, flat rhombic prisms, which are often 
broken transversely. Rutile is a common accessory in the hornblendic 
varieties of these schists, occurring as small four or eight sided prisms 
of a bright reddish, brown color. They are usually too small to allow 

* A very small outcrop of impure soapstoue occurs just uorth of the Woodley Road 
and west of Rock Creek.

an accurate determination of their optical properties, but nevertheless 
are easily recogn izable. The smaller crystals are often grouped together 
in clusters of half a dozen or more, but the larger are always single and 
scattering. The common form is that of a single prism not over l mm long 
and perhaps one-half as broad. Geniculate forms, so characteristic of 
this mineral, are met with but rarely. 

On the bank of Rock Creek, near Oak Hill Cemetery, and in numerous 
other localities in the near vicinity, a tough, though not hard, dark- 
green rock is found interstratified with the prevailing schist, which has 
been supposed by some to be a trap-rock, or " greenstone," and presuma- 
bly it is this rock that is referred to in the quotation as griinstein.* 

But however much the rock may resemble a trap in its external 
appearance, it requires but a glance with the microscope to dispel the 
illusion. The rock consists of clear, glassy quartz, very rarely a small 
crystal of a triclinic feldspar, and an abundance of hornblende and mica, 
the former very extensively altered into chlorite j and it is in this respect 
only, so far as I have observed, that the rock differs from the rirevailing 
schist in the neighborhood. So far as yet observed no true eruptive 
rock is to be found within the District limits.

ON THE COLLECTION OF MAINE BUILDING STONES IN THE 
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.* 

By GEORGE P. MERRILL. 

The large extent of coast-line of the State of Maine, composed of gran- 
itic rocks of a kind suitable for building purposes, renders possible the 
shipment and transportation of the quarried rock at rates much lower 
than would otherwise be attainable, the quarries being frequently situ- 
ated so near the water's edge that little, if any, handling is necessary 
prior to loading upon the vessel. This favorable circumstance, together 
with the excellent quality of the rock obtainable, led to the early open- 
ing of very numerous quarries both on the mainland and the adjacent 
islands, and hence at the present time we find Maine granites in very 
general use in nearly every city of importance in the country, even as 
far west as California, frequently to the almost entire exclusion of per- 
haps equally good material close at hand. 

* Collected under the superintendency of the Tenth Census, 1880. 



166 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

According to the returns furnished by the special agents in the em- 
ploy of the building-stone department of the Tenth Ceusus, there were 
during the years 1880-'82 some eighty three quarries of various kinds 
of building stone in the State, situated chiefly either immediately on the 
coast or within easy reach of tide- water. The product of these quarries, 
as may readily be imagined by one at all acquainted with the geological 
features of the State, is largely granitic ; slate is, however, quarried 
quite extensively in the eastern part of the State (Piscataquis County), 
and quarries of diabase are worked in a few cases. All the varieties 
of rock at present regularly quarried and used for building purposes 
may be classed under the following heads : 

Biotite granite. 

Biotite mu^covite granite. 

Hornblende granite. 

Hornblende biotite granite. 

Biotite gneiss. 

Biotite muscovite gneiss. 

Diabase. 

Olivine diabase. 

Argyllite or slate. 

Bepresentative specimens of all these varieties have been received at 
the National Museum and properly dressed for purposes of exhibition 
and comparison. Thin sections have also been prepared and submitted 
to microscopic examination, with the results given in the following 
pages. It is perhaps to be regretted that tests of the compressive 
strength of these stones could not have been made in this connection. 
It is, however, safe to say that, so far as can be judged from the speci- 
mens received at the Museum, any and all of them are of sufficient 
strength for all ordinary purposes of construction. There is, indeed, 
scarcely a poor stone in the collection, although of course some are 
much better than others. 

GRANITE. 

Of the eighty-three quarries already mentioned seventy-four are of 
granite or gneiss. All the Maine granites, so far as observed, are com- 
posed of three principal minerals, quartz, orthoclase, and plagioclase,* 
besides which there is always present, in such abundance as to give spe- 
cific character to the rock, one or more of the minerals muscovite, bio- 
tite, or hornblende, while apatite and magnetite can nearly always be 
detected in microscopic proportions. As a common though not so con- 
stant an accessory, there is also frequently present, in quantities so 
small as to require the microscope for their determination, one or more 

* No attempt has been made to determine the exact species of tricliuic feldspars in 
these rocks ; hence they are referred to (microcline excepted) under the general term 
plagioclase. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 167 

of the minerals zircon, epidote, sphene, rutile, microcline, and iron 
pyrites. 

In color these granites vary from very light to dark gray or nearly 
black, according to the amount and kind of mica or hornblende they 
contain, or from light pink to red, according to the color of the included 
orthoclase. In texture they vary from hue even-grained rocks, in which 
the various mineral ingredients are not easily distinguishable by the 
naked eye, to coarsely granular rocks, in which twin crystals of ortho- 
clase an inch or more in length are frequently seen. The quartz of 
these rocks never occurs in perfect crystals, but rather as crystalline 
grains Idling the interspaces of the other minerals. As sceu under the 
microscope in thin sections, it presents always a perfectly fresh and 
undecom posed appearance, and frequently contains numerous inclu- 
sions of small transparent crystals, the exact nature of which cannot 
be determined. In nearly every case it contains innumerable minute 
cavities or pores, some of which are empty while others contain the 
usual liquid and rapidly-moving bubble. 

In the majority of these granites orthoclase is the prevailing constit- 
uent, and not infrequently the one above all others to produce color and 
structural variations, as when in coarse, red crystals it gives color to the 
red granites of Calais, Jonesborough, and other localities ; or as large 
snowy-white crystals, twinned after the Carlsbad law it produces the 
porphyritic structure so often seen in the granites of Mount Waldo and 
East Blue Hill. 

As seen under the microscope, the orthoclase always presents a more 
perfect crystalline form than the quartz, having evidently been t he first to 
crystallize when the cooling process began, and hence its growth in any 
particular direction was less impeded. It is often quite turbid and 
opaque through decomposition, and included impurities, such as shreds 
of mica, hornblende, or opaque granules of unknown nature. When the 
light is shut off from below the stage of the microscope, and the section 
viewed by reflected light only, it appears as a white, snowy mass, in 
strong contrast with the black, glassy surface of the quartz. The tri- 
clinic feldspars (microcline excepted) occur usually in smaller crystals 
than the orthoclase, and are much less opaque through impurities and 
decomposition. 

Hornblende, when present, is rarely in perfect crystals, but more often 
in imperfect and distorted forms, bearing numerous inclusions of biotite, 
apatite, and magnetite. In thin sections it varies from light yellow to 
deep green in color. 

The micas usually occur in irregular laminae, destitute of crystalline 
outline, though the mnscovite is frequently met with in slender rhombic 
prisms, which are often inelosed in the orthoclase. Biotite is the more 
common mica in the Maine rocks, and in its unaltered state is of a 
smoky brown or yellow color in thin sections and strongly dichroic. 
Frequently, however, it is more or less altered into a greenish chloritic 



168 PKOCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

product, when its dichroic properties are greatly lessened. It bears 
numerous inclosures of apatite and magnetite. 

Apatite, which is present more or less in nearly all the granites and 
gneisses, occurs nearly always in minute colorless hexagonal prisms, fre- 
quently inclosed in the mica or hornblende, and showing usually one 
or more lines of fracture at right angles with their length. Epidote 
appears either as minute colorless perfect crystals or as larger irregu- 
lar grains of a faint greenish color, and slightly pleochroic, as is seen in 
the horn bleudic granite of Mount Desert. Zircons occur rather sparingly 
in many of these granites in the form of square prisms, too minute to 
allow an accurate determination. of their optical properties, but never- 
theless easily recognizable by their strong relief and peculiar iridescent 
polarization colors. 

Magnetite is present, so far as observed, in all the Maine granites, 
occurring as small opaque grains, often without crystalline form, or again 
in small perfect octahedrons. It is usually present only in microscopic 
proportions, though occasionally in sufficient abundance to be visible 
to the unaided eye as opaque lusterless grains on a polished surface. 
It is found in greatest abundance in those rocks which bear hornblende 
or biotite as their characterizing accessory, while in those in winch 
muscovite is a prevailing constituent it is almost entirely lacking. In 
but few of the rocks examined does iron pyrites occur in sufficient quan- 
tity to be of any practical importance. It can ordinarily be seen only 
with the microscope, though occasionally visible to the naked eye as 
small glistening brassy -yellow specks on a broken surface of the stone. 

Sphene is a very common accessory in many of the Maine gianites r 
occurring usually as small grayish rounded or irregular grains without 
crystalline form, though occasionally the characteristic wedge-shaped 
crystals are seen. It is but faintly pleochroic, and polarizes in dull 
colors. 

Biotite granite. — The great majority of the Maine granites are of this 
kind. They vary usually from light to dark gray in color, though pink- 
ish and red varieties are quarried in a few instances. At lied Beach, 
near Calais, there is quarried a coarse reddish rock, very compact and 
hard, which from a simple examination with the unaided eye is seen to 
be composed of coarse red orthoclase, a nearly white or cream-colored 
plagioclase, smoky quartz, and a few small shreds of mica. An exami- 
nation of a thin section with the microscope does not greatly increase 
the number of constituent minerals. The feldspars are seen to be quite 
opaque, as is the case with all the red granites, and the quartz is quite 
free from the minute colorless inclusions above referred to. The mica, 
which is usually of a greenish color, in thin sections, is very evenly 
disseminated throughout the rock and in very small shreds, bearing 
numerous inclosures of magnetite. A few small apatite crystals are as 
usual present. The rock is quite poor in plagioclase. This beautiful 
rock is fully equal if not superior in beauty and durability to much oi

the so-called Scotch granite so extensively used for monuments and 
ornamental work. 

The red granite of Jonesborough in general appearance agrees closely 
with the Red Beach rock, and under the microscope is found to differ 
only in its increased amount of plagioclase. The evenness of the grain 
and the occurrence of the mica only in small amount and in minute 
flakes are matters of practical importance, since they allow the pro- 
duction of a more perfect surface and lasting polish than would other- 
wise be possible. These granites are both used extensively for monu- 
mental purposes, and have but few blemishes, chief among which are 
the black patches to be noticed later. 

At West Sullivan a compact gray granite of medium texture is ex- 
tensively quarried, which is used largely for building and paving pur- 
poses. It is an excellent stone, and corresponds in general appearance 
very closely with that produced at the quarries of the Blaisdell Bros., 
in the town of Franklin. 

The Somesville, Mouut Desert, granite is of coarse texture and of a 
slight pinkish tinge, due to the orthoclase which is often present in. 
crystals of sufficient size to give the rock a slight porphyritic struct- 
ure. The feldspars as seen under the microscope are quite turbid and 
opaque, and the mica is often greenish, occurring only in small, ragged 
shreds. Very many magnetite granules were noticed in this rock, as well 
as a few zircons and irregular grains of sphene, which are often partially 
inclosed in the mica folia. A red granite is also found at Somesville 
which is horublendic, and will be noticed further under the head of horn- 
blende granites. 

From the vicinity of East Blue Hill have been received some of the 
most beautiful of the gray granites quarried in the State. As a general 
thing these granites are of rather coarse texture and uniform gray color, 
though many of them are rendered porphyritic through the prevalence 
of large snow-white twin crystals of orthoclase scattered throughout 
the finer gray grouudmass composing the rock. For monumental pur- 
poses this porphyritic variety is one of the most beautiful of our gray 
granites. A portion of the granite from this region is of a pinkish color, 
similar to that of Mount Desert. As seen under the microscope, the 
biotite in the East Blue Hill rock is often altered into a faint bluish- 
green product scarcely at all acted upon by polarized light, and bearing 
very numerous inclosures of black opaque grains and needle-like bodies, 
which arc doubtless magnetite. All stages of alteration are found, from 
the strongly dichroic smoky-brown biotite, with scarcely a trace of mag- 
netite, to the greenish, almost isotropic substance penetrated in every 
direction by the magnetite needles. A little muscovite is often present, 
as well as a few zircons. 

The Deer Isle granite is quite coarse and of a gray color. Large 
pinkish orthoclase crystals make up the bulk of the rock, and but little 
mica is present. The rock bears a strong resemblance to that of the 



170 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

coarser varieties of Vinalhaven and that of Hurricane Island, for -which 
it might readily be mistaken. It however differs microscopically in 
containing mnscovite, garnet, and epidote, and no hornblende, as do 
both of these rocks. 

Two varieties of granite are quarried at Mount Waldo, in the town of 
Frankfort. Both are light-gray rocks, frequently porphyritic through 
large white orthoclase crystals. Both varieties are of the same min- 
eral composition, the difference being simply one of texture, one being 
quite coarse and somewhat porphyritic, while the other is much finer 
and of more even texture. As would naturally be expected, the finer 
grade is the better and more durable rock, the coarser variety being 
more liable to crumble. The mica occurs in large flakes, which the mi- 
croscope shows to be frequently pierced by small crystals of apatite. 
A part of the mica is greenish in color and contains a few small faintly 
pleochroic grains of epidote. An occasional flake of white mica was 
noticed in this rock, and there is present the usual sprinkling of mag- 
netite granules, together with an occasional cube of pyrite. Quarries 
were opened at Mount Waldo in 1853, and single blocks 80 by 40 by 20 
feet have been taken out and afterward cut up. It is estimated that 
blocks 150 by 50 by 12 feet could be obtained if desired. The rock has 
been used largely in the building of forts on the coast of Maine, but is 
also used for all purposes, both ornamental and otherwise, to which 
granite is usually applied. It is a beautiful stone when polished. 

The granites from the numerous quarries about Vinalhaven all have 
biotite as the characterizing accessory, though in many of them more 
or less hornblende is present.* They vary in texture from very fine to 
coarse, and are mostly dark gray in color, though the coarser varieties 
are sometimes of a pinkish tinge, owing to the presence of a flesh- 
colored orthoclase. In thin sections the feldspar of this rock is seen 
to be nearly all orthoclase, but little plagioclase being present. The 
microscope brings to light small apatite, magnetite, and zircon crystals, 
invisible to the unaided eye. These are all compact, safe working stones, 
and take a good polish. They are extensively used both for building 
and ornamental purposes in all the leading cities throughout New En- 
gland and the West. Quarries were first opened at Vinalhaven about 
the year 1850. The largest single block ever taken out was the obelisk 
for the General Wool monument at Troy, K. V., which measured when 
dressed GO by 5£ by 5£ feet. It is stated that at the "Harbor Quarry" 
a single block 240 feet long by 32 feet wide and 8 feet in thickness 
'might be obtained if desired. 

The rock of Hurricane Island closely corresponds to that of Vinal- 

* In Hitchcock's "Report on the Geology and Natural History of Maine," 1862, p. 
265, the Vinalhaven rock is referred to as a "peculiarly fine-grained syenite of good 
color," &c. In none of the specimens received at the Museum from this locality, 
however, does liornhlende play more than a secondary part, and in the majority of 
cases does not appear at all. Hence, all are classed as biotite granites. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 171 

haven, especially to the coarser variety from the " Harbor Quarry." 
Like the Vinalhaven rock, it too contains a small amount of hornblende, 
with zircon, apatite, sphene, and magnetite in microscopic proportions. 
The minute llnidal cavities in the quartz of this rock are often seen ar- 
ranged in regular wavy lines. A single block now loosened from the 
quarry, 80 feet long by 40 feet deep and 25 feet wide, shows the immense 
masses in which this stone occurs. 

The Swanville granite is a very pretty, fine, dark-gray stone, so closely 
resembling the finer varieties from Vinalhaven that a special description 
is unnecessary. 

At South Thbmaston two varieties of biotite granite are quarried. 
The one a dark-gray rock of medium fineness of texture, closely resem- 
bling the finer varieties of the Saint George rock and also that of Round 
Pond, in Lincoln County, in external appearance; the other a coarse 
gray rock containing large white feldspars and much mica in folia of 
considerable size. The finer variety contains, in microscopic crystals, 
microcline, muscovite, epidote. apatite, sphene, and magnetite, while 
the coarser differs in its lack of microcline and in containing small 
quantities of hornblende and pyrite. The variety from the locality 
known as Spruce Head, in spite of its coarse texture and abundant 
mica, is said to weather well and hold its color most excellently. 

The Dix Island granite is a coarse, gray rock, containing scattering 
crystals of a flesh-colored feldspar. It contains a large proportion of 
quartz, and is consequently hard and rather brittle. A part of the feld- 
spar of this rock shows under the microscope the peculiar network struct- 
ure characteristic of microcline. Muscovite, epidote, sphene, and mag- 
netite are present in small proportions, visible only with the microscope. 

The Wayne granite is a coarse stone of quite uneven texture, con- 
taining large crystals of faintly flesh-colored orthoclase and an abundance 
of mica. Some hornblende is also present, which accounts for the name 
syenite as locally applied. The specimen received from this locality is 
rather below the average of the Maine granites. It is not extensively 
quarried. Its use is principally local. 

The Canaan granite is coarse, dark gray, aud of rather uneven text- 
ure. It contains a large amount of black mica and scattering crystals 
of hornblende. It is not a handsome stone, although it works well and 
takes a good polish. It is used principally for underpinnings in the 
near vicinity. 

At Brunswick two varieties of granite, a coarse and a fine, are quarried 
on a small scale, principally for local use. The color of the finer variety 
is very uniform but of a slight yellowish cast on a polished surface. Both 
varieties contain muscovite in considerable abundance. The finer stone 
from the quarry of N. Cripps has been used in the construction of the 
Bowdoin College chapel, First Parish church, Portland, and several 
other large builcings in the State. 

The granite quarried at Pownal is a beautiful, fine, even-grained gray

stone, easy to work and apparently admirably adapted for all kinds of 
work, both ornamental and otherwise. Considerable discretion is how- 
ever needed in selecting this rock, since in many portions of the quarry 
the sap has penetrated to a depth of several inches and entirely ruined 
the stone for architectural purposes. Much of the granite in this lo- 
cality also is so charged with iron pyrites that a short exposure to the 
atmosphere causes it to become spotted with innumerable iron-rust 
stains that arc very unsightly. This stone was extensively used in the 
construction of the new capitol building at Albany, N. Y., but owing 
to the defects already mentioned its principal use is for paving in cities 
in the near vicinity. The stone occurs in the quarry, usually in thin 
sheets, and splits out very readily. A single slab 90 feet in length, 4 
feet in width, and 20 inches in thickness, has been split out, and much 
larger could be obtained if desired. 

The granites from the various Biddeford quarries are all practically 
identical. They are coarse, gray rocks of quite even texture and good 
working qualities, closely resembling the granites from East Blue Hill. 
The chief accessory minerals are muscovite, apatite, magnetite, and 
pyrite. These granites are extensively used in the construction of Forts 
Preble and Scammel and in various light-houses and sea-walls along 
the coast of New England. 

The rock quarried at Bryant's Pond, in Oxford County, is a fine, dark- 
gray granite containing much black mica and a little hornblende, together 
with an abundance of plagioclase. Thin sections of this rock show 
numerous grains of sphene of a brownish-gray color, and usually of a 
rounded or very irregular form. Magnetite, apatite, and zircon occur in 
microscopic proportions. This stone is employed chiefly for railroad 
work. 

The Saint George granites are all of fine, even texture, and of a gray 
color, being very similar in every respect to the South Thomaston stone 
just mentioned. They are compact and free-working stones, taking a 
good polish, and are extensively used for building, paving, and orna- 
mental work. A dark-gray hornblendic rock is also quarried here. 
This will be noticed later. 

The Waldoborough, Lincoln County, granite is of a fine texture and 
in color varies from light to dark gray. It is a good working stone and 
takes a good polish, but is not extensively quarried, and is used prin- 
cipally for underpinnings and cemetery work. The lighter variety con- 
tains much white mica, and might well be classed under the head of 
biotite muscovite granite. The Bound Pond rock is much darker, liner, 
and of a somewhat gneissoid structure. It contains a large amount of 
black mica, which, however, is evenly disseminated in small laminae 
throughout the mass of the rock. By the microscope small shreds of 
muscovite, together with scattering crystals of apatite, zircon, sphene, 
magnetite, and iron pyrites are brought to light, the pyrites frequently 
being visible to the naked eye as small, brassy-yellow specks on a broken 
face of the rock. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 173 

The Kennebunkport rock is a coarse, dull-gray granite, in which the 

feldspar is nearly all orthoclase and very impure and muddy. The small 
cavities in the quartz are very abundant. Biotite occurs only in small, 
very ragged shreds, often altered into a greenish product, and bearing 
numerous irregular inclosures of yellowish-green epidote. Sphene 
abounds in well-defined wedge-shaped crystals, which stand out in bold 
relief from the surface of the section. Apatite, zircon, and magnetite 
are present in small scattering crystals. The stoue works well and 
takes a good polish. Its principal markets are the larger cities in Maine 
and New Hampshire. 

Very many of these biotite granites contain numerous masses or 
nodules of a darker color and finer texture than the rock itself, they 
frequently appearing as black patches on a polished surface. These 
are of all sizes up to a foot in diameter. They sometimes occur with 
sharp, distinct outlines, or again merge gradually into the surrounding 
rock with no definite line of demarcation. Some of them possess a 
fine, even texture, while others are rendered slightly porphyritic in 
structure through included crystals of plagioclase of considerable size. 
Under the microscope they are all found to consist essentially of the 
same minerals as the rocks in which they occur, although in a more 
finely crystalline state and different proportions; biotite usually pre- 
vails and causes the dark color of the patch. Very many of them, how- 
ever, are penetrated in every direction by innumerable, minute, color- 
less, needle-like crystals, an exact determination of which, on account 
of their small size, is impossible. Many of the included larger crystals 
of feldspar, which, so far as observed, are always triclinic, have their 
angles rounded away, and are reduced to mere oval grains. Such nod- 
ules are usually regarded as of concretionary origin.* The finer texture 
and darker color of these patches render them very conspicuous, and in 
some of the quarries many fine blocks of granite are rendered entirely 
unsuited for finely finished or polished work on account of their abun- 
dance. 

Hornblende granite. — This is rather a rare building-stone in Maine, 
though extensively quarried in other States. Its production is at pres- 
ent confined to Otter Creek, Mount Desert, where a beautiful coarse 
red rock is quarried, which on a superficial examination somewhat resem- 
bles the biotite granites of Calais and Jouesborough, though lacking the 
cream-colored feldspar and consequent speckled appearance character- 
istic of these rocks. Orthoclase predominates over all other constitu- 
ents, and is deep-red in color. Under the microscope the feldspars 
are so opaque that their optical properties can be determined only ap- 
proximately. The hornblende occurs in small broken fragments and

very imperfect crystals of a deep-green or yellowish color, and often 
much altered into a greenish-yellow chlorite. Numerous small square 
prisms of zircon are included in the hornblende or scattered about in 
close proximity. Epidote is abundant in quite large irregular masses or 
flakes. It is of a faint, greenish-yellow color, and plainly pleoehroic. 
Magnetite in this rock is not particularly abundant, though occurring 
in rather large grains. The quartz contains very numerous cavities, 
which are, however, exceedingly minute. 

This rock is very compact and hard, but works well and takes an ex- 
cellent surface and polish. It is of finer texture than the Scotch red 
grauites, and bears a closer resemblance to red granite of the Bay of 
Fundy than to any other at present in the collection. If the specimen 
received at the Museum is a fair sample of the rock at the quarry, it is 
certainly a most excellent stone. 

Hornblende biotite granite. — The quarrying of this variety of granite 
is confined to rather limited areas, specimens having been received from 
but two localities, Saint George and Lincoln. The Saint George rock 
is of fine texture, and dark gray in color, nearly black on a polished sur- 
face, the dark color being due to the abundance of hornblende and black 
mica. By the unaided eye the rock is readily seen to be composed 
principally of quartz, feldspar, hornblende, and biotite, with scattering 
grains of magnetite and iron pyrites. It is quite poor in quartz, and 
under the microscope the prevailing feldspar is seen to be a triclinic 
variety. Hornblende is very abundant, and occurs in quite perfect 
crystals, which are deep green and yellow in thin sections and strongly 
dichroic. Biotite is less abundant than the hornblende, and it incloses 
numerous magnetite grains and apatite crystals. It is quite pure, and 
of a light straw color in thin sections, varying to deep brown as the 
stage of the microscope is revolved. Occasional grains of epidote and 
sphene were noticed, and, more rarely, shreds of chlorite, resulting from 
the alteration of the hornblende. Numerous grains of calcite are read- 
ily distinguished in the thin section occupying the interspaces of the 
other minerals, and the powdered rock effervesces distinctly in dilute 
acids. So large an amount of this mineral must have an important 
action upon the weathering properties of the rock. 

Lincoln. The rock quarried at Lincoln, although of nearly the same 
mineral composition, is wholly unlike that of Saint George in appear- 
ance, being of much lighter color and coarser texture. Large white and 
slightly flesh-colored twin crystals of orthoclase, quartz, hornblende, 
mica, and in a few instances grains of pyrite, are all readily distinguish- 
able by the naked eye, while with the microscope are brought to view 
the usual amounts of apatite and magnetite, with, more rarely, small zir- 
cons, wedges of sphene, and irregular grains of epidote. The sphene is 
brownish in color, and the crystals quite large. The hornblende is deep 
green and yellow, in thin sections, and some of the smaller crystals show 
quite perfect basal outliues. Biotite is very abundant and in large

flakes. In external appearance this rock is very much like the coarser 
varieties of the Biddeford granite. 

Muscovite biotite granites. — The granite of Augusta and Hailowell has 
long been justly celebrated for its beauty and fiue working qualities. It 
is a fine, light-gray rock, the uniformity of whose texture is often broken 
by the presence of large white crystals of microcline, which inclose 
small, rounded grains of quartz. Biotite and muscovite occur in abun- 
dance, and in about equal proportions, but in small flakes, the muscovite 
appearing as small, silvery-white, glistening particles on a broken sur- 
face of the rock. Under the microscope three feldspars are readily dis- 
tinguished — orthoclase in imperfect crystals and irregular graius, an 
abundance of plagioclase, and microcline in large plates filled with cav- 
ities and inclosures of muscovite and quartz. In the thin sections the 
quartz inclosures are usually circular in outline and are pierced in every 
directiou by minute, thread-like crystals of rutile, in polarized light 
showing up in strong contrast with the beautiful basket-work structure 
of the inclosing microcline. All the feldspars are quite fresh and pure. 
The quartz is in small, irregular grains, containing but few cavities, but 
innumerable threads of rutile. The biotite occurs in small shreds, with- 
out any attempt at crystalline form, while the muscovite, although 
usually in larger, irregular lamina?, is also sometimes found in small, 
perfect, rhombic prisms. A few apatite crystals are present, together 
with occasional garnets, which in thin sections are always destitute of 
crystalline form, appearing as rounded or oval nearly colorless bodies 
traversed by many irregular lines of fracture. They are quite free from 
impurities, though occasionally containing inclosures of biotite. As 
is usual in muscovite-bearing rocks but little magnetite is present; in 
two cases only grains of pyrite were noticed. 

This is one of the best working of the Maine granites, and is used 
very extensively, not only for building and monuments, but is carved 
iuto statues like marble. The rock is properly a gneiss, but showing 
no signs of stratification in the hand specimen is classed here as a granite. 
As illustrative of the great extent of the quarries, it is stated that blocks 
200 feet in length, by 40 feet in width and 8 feet in thickness, can be 
broken out in a single piece if so desired. 

The rock quarried at North Jay is practically identical with that of 
Hallowell, and need not be further noticed here. The Lincolnville rock 
is a trifle darker, but otherwise appears nearly the same. All closely 
resemble the well-known granite of Concord, N. H. 

GNEISS. 

The composition of gneiss is identical with that of granite, from which 
it differs only in structural modifications, its characterizing feature being 
that it possesses a laminated or stratified appearance due to the arrange- 
ment of the individual crystals constituting the accessory minerals (mica 
and hornblende). It is therefore scarcely necessary to go into a special 



176 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

description of any of these, since what lias been said in regard to the 
granites will apply equally well to the gneisses. At present they seem 
to be quarried only to a limited extent and in but few localities. At 
Turner a biotitic gneiss of medium texture is quarried, in which a few 
grains of sphene were noticed. At Jefferson a fine gray gneiss is quar- 
ried which contains both biotite and muscovite, the latter occurring fre- 
quently as slender prisms inclosed in the orthoclase. Epidote is also 
present in irregular grains as well as a little apatite. 

At Chesterville a fine gray gneiss is quarried, which somewhat closely 
resembles the Jefferson stone both in appearance and mineral composi- 
tion. 

On account of its laminated structure gneiss splits readily from the 
quarry in slabs of any desirable thickness. Its distinct grain, however, 
causes it to work unevenly in different directions, and it is not so well 
suited for purposes of general construction as granite. It is best suited 
for curbing and the rough work of foundations. 

DIABASE. 

Under the name of black granite, diabase is quarried at three locali- 
ties in the State — Indian Eiver, in the town of Addison, Addison Point, 
and Vinalhaven. 

The Indian Eiver rock is nearly black in color and of a texture too 
fine to allow an accurate determination of its true character by the 
unaided eye. Under the microscope it is found to consist essentially 
of plagioclase and augite, although considerable hornblende and mica 
are present. The hornblende, without doubt, results from the alter- 
ation of the augite, since abundant examples are to be seen in which 
the centers of crystals are nearly colorless, unaltered augite, while 
the borders are plainly hornblendic. The mica is sufficiently abundant 
to be recognizable to the naked eye, and is of a smoky-yellow, or at 
times copper-red, color, in thin sections. Apatite is abundant in the 
usual colorless prisms. 

The Addison Point rock closely resembles that of Indian Eiver in 
external appearance, but shows a marked difference in structure un- 
der the microscope. Olivine is present in abundant, rounded, colorless 
grains, traversed by numerous irregular curvilinear lines, and fre- 
quently much altered into serpentine. Hornblende and chlorite are 
both present as in the Addison Point rock, and evidently derived from 
the augite. Titanic iron is abundant and often much altered, taking on 
fan-shaped and other fantastic forms. 

An olivine-bearing diabase is also quarried at Vinalhaven. It is a 
hard, compact rock, quite fresh-appearing in thin sections, although con- 
taining a little of both hornblende and chlorite as alteration products. 
Some mica is also present. 

Magnetite is so abundant in all these diabases as to be very notice- 
able as black, lusterless grains on a polished surface of the rock.

Vol. VI, No. 13. Washington, D. €. Oct. 5, 1883. 

Owing to their fine, homogeneous texture these rocks are great favor- 
ites for monuments and ornamental work, for which they are extensively 
used. Their somber colors, however, render them rather undesirable 
for general building purposed. 

SLATE. 

Slates of very good quality are extensively quarried at Munson and 
Brownville, Piscataquis County. So far as observed they are blue-black 
in color, of fine, even texture, tough, and split readily into thin plates 
suitable for roofing purposes, for which they are principally used. They 
are also well adapted for mantels and fire-places, and at one time quite 
a business was carried on in the manufacture of these from the so-called 
a marbleized slate," but which has since been discontinued.

0> THE .11 ACROC IIFII.t X OF PHILLIPS, IM,1( TOSTVMS OF CO.\- 
RAD, AND SOLFNISCITS OF MEEK & WORTHEN. 

By CHARLES A. WHITE. 

Among the somewhat numerous species of fossil shells which have 
been published from North American Devonian and Carboniferous rocks, 
especially the latter, and which have been referred to the genus Macro- 
cheilus of Phillips, are certain forms which plainly do not answer the de- 
scription of that genus as it was originally given or as its characteristics 
have usually been stated by authors. The differences between these spe- 
cies and those which I regard as true Macrocheilus pertain mainly to the 
columella and inner lip, but they also possess a more massive test than 
those which are referred to Macrocheilus proper. ISome of the American 
species which have been referred to Macrocheilus have a plain, more or 
less sinuous inner lip, which is only slightly covered with callus, and 
destitute of any trace of ridges or folds. These I assume to be typical 
forms of that genus, and the following, among others, may be mentioned 
as examples: Macrocheilus heoe and M. hamiltoniw Hall, of the Devonian, 
and M. anguliferus White, of the Carboniferous. My present belief is 
that all the Devonian forms which have been referred to Macrocheilus 
will fall into this group, but it will properly include only a very small 
part of those which have been referred to that genus from Carboniferous 
strata. 

With the very few exceptions referred to, I think that all the numer- 
ous North American Carboniferous forms which various authors have 
referred to Macrocheilus constitute a distinct natural group, which ought 
to be designated by one and a different generic name. I also think the 
form for which Meek and Worthen proposed the generic name of Solen is- 
cus should be included in this group. 

The shells of this group are characterized by a more or less thickened 
inner lip, which also bears one more or less distinct revolving fold. This 
fold, when the outer lip is entire, is usually visible only as an obtuse 
prominence near the anterior end of the inner lip, but upon breaking 
away the outer lip the fold is usually found to be distinct and often sharp 
and prominent. Sometimes also there is upon the posterior side of the 
fold a broad, concave depression, which ends at and deepens the inward 
flexure of the inner lip, the posterior border of which depression is some- 
times so well defined as to appear like a second revolving fold. This 
depression, which is sometimes a tolerably distinct groove, is excavated 
out of the callus which covers the columella and inner lip, in such cases 
quite thickly, between the depression and the posterior angle of the 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 185 

aperture. Forward of the fold there is little and sometimes no accumu- 
lation of callus, the anterior end of the outer lip, where it joins the inner 
lip, being usually thin and more or less prominent when entire. There 
is, therefore, in unbroken shells a rather broad, short, more or less dis- 
tinct anterior canal, too broad and short to really deserve the name of 
canal, strongly recalling the corresponding part of Nassa. The anterior 
border of this short canal, however, is promineut, and not emarginatc, 
as in Nassa. 

From the fact that the coin rnellar fold upon these Carboniferous shells 
is distinct only within the aperture, and the latter is usually filled with 
the imbedding matrix, this distinguishing feature seems to have usually 
escaped notice. It has not always done so, however; both those emi- 
nent paleontologists, Professors Hall* and Geinitz,t having referred to 
it in published descriptions. Meek and Worthen also observed that the 
inner lip is " usually provided with an obtuse revolving fold"; but none 
of these authors appear to have regarded that feature as separating such 
shells generically from those which are destitute of it. Mr. Conrad, 
however, so early as 1842, proposed the generic name of Plectostyhis 
to include shells possessing this character, but that name was previously 
used by Beck for another group of mollusks. Mr. S. A. Miller, also, in 
his Catalogue of American Paleozoic Fossils, refers the Macroclieilu* 
halli of Gcinitz to Soleniscus Meek and Worthen. In 1881 I described^: 
two similar species from the Carboniferous rocks of New Mexico, and 
also referred them to Soleniscus. 

Notwithstanding the conscientious accuracy which is apparent in all 
the work of those authors, I suspected that the anterior portion of 
Meek ami Worthen's type species of Soleniscus is not so prominent as it 
is represented to be by the restored part of their figures. 

Applying to Mr. Worthen for permission to examine the type-speci- 
men, I learned that it was inaccessible, but he sent me for examination an 
authentic duplicate example. A careful examination of this specimen 
satisfies me that the anterior portion of the shell in this species is only a 
little more prominent than it is in several of those forms which have been 
referred to Macrochcihis, and that that portion is not produced into a 
proper beak. Meek and Worthen's figures show that the anterior portion 
of their type-specimen was broken off, and if the line of the restored part 
had been continued with the curve of the outer lip it would agree with the 
lines of growth which are observable upon the specimen sent me by Mr. 
Worthen. Moreover, their figure shows a prominence of the fold upon 
the inner lip which did not appear on the one just referred to until I 
had dug out the stony material which had filled the aperture. Their

186 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

figure appears to represent the outer lip as unbroken; but to exhibit 
the columellar fold so prominently as that figure shows it to be, the 
outer lip must have been largely removed. 

Understanding the real characters of the type-species of Soleniscus to 
be such as I have here indicated, it is, I think, necessary to regard it as 
congeneric with the greater part, if not all, of those forms which are fig- 
ured with it on Plate VIII, and with most of those Carboniferous shells 
which have been by different authors referred to Macrocheilus. The prin- 
cipal differences, according to my observations, which that species pre- 
sents from the others referred to, are its more than usually elongate form, 
a little greater than the usual prominence of the anterior part of the 
aperture, and a smaller accumulation of callus upon the inner lip. 

These forms, as before remarked, are regarded as constituting a nat- 
ural group, which, it appears to me, well deserve a generic designation 
distinct from Macrocheilus. If it were not that Conrad's name, Plecto- 
stylus, was preoccupied by Beck, that name would be appropriately re- 
tained for this group, to which it was really applied. Conrad's name 
not being available, the next generic name that has been used for any 
member of the group ought to be used for the whole group. As Solen- 
iscus is regarded as a member of this group, that name should be prop- 
erly used for it because no other available name has priority. 

The following species which have been hitherto referred to Macro- 
cheilus have been found to possess the prominent columellar fold and 
other characteristics of the group here discussed, and I would therefore 
refer them to Soleniscus : Macrocheilus fusiformis Hall, M. neioberryi 
Hall, ill. planus White, M. ventricosus Hall (= Soleniscus brevis White), 
M. texanus Shumard? M. paludimvformis Hall, and M. halli Geinitz. 
All except the last are figured on Plate VIII. 

It is not to be denied that there are certain forms among those Car- 
boniferous species which have usually been referred to Macrocheilus 
that possess at best only an obtuse fold upon the columella. They are, 
however, much more closely related by all their characteristics to the 
species just referred to Soleniscus than are those Devonian and other 
species which I have referred to Macrocheilus proper. Among these 
species are the three following, which are represented with the others 
on Plate VIII: Macrocheilus ponderosus Swallow? M. mcdialisMeek & 
Worthen, and M. primigenius Conrad. These I regard as at best no 
more than subgenerically different from those which I refer to Solenis- 
cus. 

As to the family relations of the shells of this group I am inclined to 
adopt the views suggested by Meek, that they belong to the Actaonidce. 
Those shells which I have referred to the genus Macrocheilus proper are 
perhaps not suggestive of such a relationship, but they do not appear 
to differ from the Soleniscus group any more than some recognized gen- 
era of the Actcaonidm do from certain other genera of that family.

tThe name Macrocheilus fusiformis was preoccupied by Sowerby. Professor Hall*s species belongs 
to the group which I refer to Soleniscus. If this view is accepted, and Sowerby's species also belongs 
to that group, the name of the American species must be changed.

A REVIEW OF THE AMERICAN (ARANOINJE. 

By DAVID S. JORDAN and CHARLES II. GILBERT. 

The purpose of the present paper is to furnish a catalogue of the spe- 
cies of Carangince found in American waters, with an outline of the 
synonymy of each, and a key by which the species may be distinguished. 
The subfamily Carangince, as understood by us, includes the Selenince, 
Carangince, and Chloroscombrince of Dr. Gill (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mux., 
1882, 492), or the genera Trachurns, Carangichthys, Caranx, Argyreiosus, 
and Micropteryx of Dr. Giinther (Cat. Fish. Brit. Mus., ii, 418). In Dr. 
Ltitken's classification (Spolia Atlantica, 19G) this group would corre- 
spond to the genera Trachurus, Megalaspis, Decapterus, Caranx, Gall- 
ichthys, Selene, and Micropteryx. 

The division of this group into genera offers numerous difficulties, 
inasmuch as the various characters of form, squamation, dentition, and 
armature are subject to almost complete intergradation. A division 
based on any of these characters would be imperfect from the presence 
of intermediate forms connecting one group with another. 

A minute subdivision has been attempted by Dr. Bleeker and Dr. Gill, 
and numerous generic names have been proposed, which have not met 
with general acceptance because the distinctive characters disappear as 
our knowledge of the species increases, and the adoption of these genera 
would necessitate the making of still others for species more or less 
aberrant. 

For the present we venture to divide the group into six genera, as 
follows : 

1. Megalaspis; 

2. Decapterus; 

3. Trachurus; 

4. Caranx; 

5. Selene; 

6. Chloroscombrus. 

This division is not wholly natural, inasmuch as the differences be- 
tween the extremes among the species of Caranx are greater than those 
separating some of these species from related genera, while, on the other 
hand, the characters separating Trachurus and Selene from Caranx are 
technical only, and have little real value. Under the head of Caranx 
we recognize a number of subgenera, which seem to intergrade too 
closely to permit us to consider any of them as of full generic rank.

Four specimens of this species are known, all obtained by Mr. Xautus 
at Cape San Lucas. It is probably a subspecies of D. macarellus, as 
already noted by us, the differences being of minor importance and of 
doubtful permanence.

Type Scomber carangus Bloch= Scomber hippos L. 

We see no sufficient reason for setting aside the earliest restriction of 
the genus Caranx, and therefore, with Bleeker, consider Caranx hippos 
(carangus) as the type. The reasons which have led Professor Gill to 
regard Caranx speciosus as the type are given in full in the Proc. Ac. 
Nat. Sci. Phila., 1802, 433, to which the reader is referred. 

The species here associated in the genus Caranx differ widely in form, 
C. crumenophthalmus standing at one extreme, and C. setipinnis at the 
other. The gradation from one type to the other is unusually perfect, 
and we find it quite impossible to introduce any satisfactory lines of 
generic division. We may, however, recognize a number of subgenera 
of unequal, and for the most part of low, value, as follows: 

1, TRAcnuROPS (crumenophthalmus). 

2 Hemicaranx (= Carangops Gill ;) (amblyrhynchus; atrimanus). 

3 Uraspis (vinctus; leucurus; dentex; platcssa; ruber).

Our arrangement of the Garangoid genera agrees with that given by 

Liitken (Spolia Atlantica, 1880, 124), with the following exceptions: 

We do net regard Gallichthys (Blepharis) as a genus distinct from 
Caranx, as neither of the two characters assigned by Ltitken to the 
former genus (partial or total absence of scales and disappearance of 
the spinous dorsal) is diagnostic. Neither can be used to draw a line 
between Garanx otrynter and Caranx crinitus. We refer the subgenus 
Vomer to Garanx rather than to Selene, as it really possesses the lateral 
shields of the former. 

ANALYSIS OF AMERICAN SPECIES OF CARANX.* 

a. Shoulder-girdle with a deep cross-furrow at its junction with the isthmus, ahove 

which is a fleshy projection ; body elongate, the 
depth about 3J in length ( Iraehwopa Gill). 
b. Teeth, feeble, in a narrow hand above, the outer slightly enlarged; eye very large, 

with largo adipose eyelid, its diameter about 
3 in head; interopercle and branchiostegals 
truncate behind; breast scaly; lateral lino 
scarcely arched, its plates small, about 40 in 
number; soft dorsal and anal slightly falcate, 
with conspicuous basal sheath ; pectoral shorter 
than head ; 2d D. 1, 25 ; A. 1, 21. 

CRUMEXOrnTHALMUS, 8. 

aa. Shoulder-girdle normal, its surface even. 

c. Teeth of jaws in few series, unequal or at least not forming villiform bands, 

the outer series above usually enlarged, tho 
lower teeth usually uniserial. 

* We are unable to place the following species in the key, on account of imperfec- 
tions in the description: 
Caranx peruanus Tschudi. 

Caranx peruanus Tschndi, Fauna Peruana, Iohthyologie, 1845, 19 (Pern). 

This species remains thus far unidentified. The following is an outline of the descrip- 
tion, which seems to be erroneous in some respects: 

D. IX, 1, 23. Depth 6£ in length (with caudal) ; head 4 (without caudal). Mouth 
not extending to eye. Teeth all fine and villiform. Teeth on tongue, vomer, and 
palatines. Eye large. Lateral Hue sharply bent. Second dorsal highest in front. 
Pectoral extending to first ray of soft dorsal. Color, dark bluish above; bellynot very

According to Streets, the East Indian representative of the type of 
Trackurops {Caranx mauritianus Quoy & Gaim.), is a different species 
from the American form. It is, perhaps, doubtful to which species the 
name crumenophthalmus was originally applied, as we find no definite 
record of the occurrence of our species on the coast of Guinea, the 
locality assigned by Bloch. This species is common in the West Indies, 
and ranges occasionally northward to Cape Cod. Numerous specimens 
have been taken at Cape San Lucas and at Panama. We do not see 
that these differ from the Atlantic type.

We have made no study of this species, but follow authors in iden- 
tifying' the Caranx luna of the Mediterranean with the Brazilian spe- 
cies {dentex). The Scomber ascensionis of Osbeck, wrongly identified by 
Forster with Caranx lugubris, is probably this species, but the meager 
description does not authorize a change of name. Caranx solea, al- 
though not hitherto identified, seems to be certainly the present species.

Caranx chilensis Cay, Hist. Chili Zool., 1850, ii, 235 (Juan Fernandez); 
Steindachuer, Ichth. Beitr., ii, 17, 1875 (Juan Fernandez). 

Habitat. — South Pacific, New Zealand, Australia, coast of Chili. 

We follow Dr. Giintber in identifying the Chilian C. chilensis with the 
Australian species, there being no discrepancies in the description. We 
have compared the detailed descriptions of this species and of C. dentex 
given by Steindachner, and can find no difference likely to be per- 
manent. The sole difference indicated by Dr. Giinther ("This spe- 
cies is closely allied to C. dentex, from which it differs by the presence 
of teeth on the palate") has been shown by Steindachner and Vinci- 
guerra to be fallacious, being dependent on age. It is therefore probable 
that C. platessa is identical with C. dentex, as well as with C. cltilensis,

Habitat. — West Indies; North Carolina to Brazil. 

We have united under the above head a number of nominal species 
from the West Indies, which from the published descriptions we are 
unable to distinguish. 

Since the description by Professor Jordan of Caranx beani. we have 
examined the young' of various species, and have now little doubt that 
the much greater depth of the body in beani, as distinguished from cibi, 
is due to the immaturity of the types of the former. There is nothing 
in Poey's description of G. iridinus to distinguish it from G. cibi (color 
plumbeous instead of yellow, &c), and our notes on types of the two 
preserved in the National Museum likewise fail to indicate any differ- 
ence. G bartkolomwi is said to have 33 to 35 lateral shields, and is more- 
over compared with C. chrysus. The description otherwise agrees fully 
with G. cibi, and it is possible that 5 or 6 of the smaller scales were in- 
cluded in the enumeration of the scutes. So far as we can see, C. blochii, 
as described by Giinther and Cuvier &. Valenciennes, agrees with G. 
cibi. The earlier name ruber, although inappropriate, the original red- 
ness of the type coming from spoiled alcohol, and having been inten- 
sified into carmine by the artist, can hardly be set aside.

We have compared our specimen from Clarion Island with one of

differ somewhat in form and in the height of the fins, but we have no 
doubt that all belong to the same species. The name aseensionis should 
not be retained for this species, having evidently been first given to 
some other, probably to G. dentex.

Habitat. — Pacific coast of tropical America ; Mazatlan ; Panama. 

This species marks the transition from u Caranx " to " BlcpharixP 
The adult would be referred to the latter genus, while the young might 
find place in Carangoides if these petty subdivisions should be retained. 
The relations of C. otrynter with C. armatus (Forskal) are rather close, 
but the two seem to be satisfactorily separated. 

Compared with typical species of Caranx (as C. hippos), C. otrynter 
differs strikingly in many respects, among others the following : The 
greater compression and elevation of the body, the greater length and 
sharpness of the breast, the much greater depth of the preorbital region, 
the greater prominence and sharpness of the frontal and occipital keel, 
the more oblique position of the bones of the head, the feebleness and 
uniformity of the teeth, the approximation below of the mandibular 
rami, the reduction in size of the scales and scutes, and the increase 
of the naked areas, the reduction or loss (in the adult) of the dorsal and 
anal spines, the increase in length of the lobes of the dorsal, anal, and 
caudal, and, finally, the increase in the difference between the old and the 

* Orpvvzt/p, a driver, in allusion to tbe whip-like ray of the second dorsal. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 203 

young. Not one of these features can, however, be used for generic 
distinction, as they increase by easy transitions from species to species. 
On the other hand, comparing Caranx otrynter with Selene vomer, we 
find that in almost every one of the differences above noted the latter 
species carries these characters to a still greater extreme, and differs 
from Caranx otrynter in just the respects in which the latter differs from 
Caranx hippos. Caranx setipinnis is, in some regards, a species still 
more extreme than Selene vomer, although it has not quite lost the 
lateral scutes.

The many nominal species of this type have been reduced by Liitken 
to three or four: C. gallus and C. ciliaris of the East Indies, C. alexan- 
drinits of North Africa, and C. crinitus of America. We have not 
examined the East Indian forms, but see no reason for doubting that 
ciliaris is the young of gallus, as has been supposed by Dr. Day and 
others. Our young specimens of C. crinitus, moreover, agree fully with 
the figures of C. ciliaris. We think it, therefore, extremely probable 
that all the nominal species of this type (except C. alexanrfriiius) are

forms of Caranx (/alius. We, however, follow Liitken in retaining the 
American name until specimens can be actually compared. As has 
been shown by Liitken (Spolia Atlantica, 197), the nominal genera 
Scyris, Blepharis, Gallichthys, and llynnis are simply stages in the devel- 
opment of the individuals, their characters changing with age.

This species is generally abundant within its range. Some local 
variations occur, but most of the above nominal species are based on 
the changes due to age, or on individual peculiarities shown by single 
specimens. It is possible that C. gabonensis (having the depth more 
than half the total length) and G. dorsalis (slenderer, with the rays of 
the second dorsal, 1, 25) are really distinct species. It seems, however, 
very unlikely. The remaining species of M. Guichenot, as well as his 
family Vomeridce, seem to be wanton synonyms, without excuse.

known. The variations depending on age are in this group extreme.

This species represents G. chrysurus on the Pacific coast of tropical 
America. It is very similar to the latter, and will probably be consid- 
ered as a geographical variety of it when these fishes are better known. 

RECAPITULATION. 

We have in this paper admitted 30 species of Garangince. More or 
less doubt is attached to the nomenclature or systematic position of 
several of these. We therefore repeat the list here, with the nature of 
the doubts remaining to be solved in each case. The general distribu- 
tion of the species is indicated by the letters W. (Western Atlantic), 
A. (Western Africa), P. (Eastern Pacific, Panama, &c), E. (East In- 
dies),

IVOTK ON THE C5ENERA OF I'KTROMYZOMID.K. 

By DAVID S. JORDAN and CHARLES H. GILBERT. 

In the Proceedings of the National Museum for 1882, p. 521, is a 
review of the genera of Lampreys, by Dr. Gill. In the analysis of the 
genera several characters not hitherto recognized have been noticed, 
and the paper is a substantial addition to our knowledge of these ani- 
mals. The characters drawn from the dentition of the supraoral lamina 
are, however, unreliable for the distinction of genera. Thus in Petro- 
myzon and Ammoccetes this lamina is said to be bicuspid, while in Ichthy- 
omyzon and Entosphcmis it is described as tricuspid. In Petromyzon 
and Entosphenus, so far as we have noticed, the description given by 
Professor Gill fully applies. In Ichthyomyzon the supraoral lamina is 
bicuspid in the common species, I. argenteus, but tricuspid in I. casta- 
neus and I. h initio, species not generically distinct from I. argenteus, and 
whose specific validity, indeed, may be questioned. Ammoccetes usually 
has a broad supraoral lamina, with a tooth at each end, but very often, 
at least in our common species A. niger, there is also a median cusp, 
as in Entosphemis. We have no doubt that Ammoccetes (as understood 
by Dr. Gill) should be generically separated from Petromyzon. The 
characters of Ichthyomyzon and of Entosphenus arc, however, of less 
importance. The teeth of Ichthyomyzon are all essentially as in Petro- 
myzon, but proportionately smaller, weaker, and with less developed 
points and seme. The same is nearly true of the teeth of Ammoccetes 
in comparison with those of Entosphenus. Petromyzon and Entosphenus 
are large marine species, ascending fresh waters only to spawn (or occa- 
sionally land-locked), while Iclttlu/omyzon and Ammoccetes are their re- 
spective fresh- water representatives, smaller, weaker, and less special- 
ized. Convenience is probably best served by recognizing all four groups 
as genera.

INSCRIPTION OF A SEW MURiENOIR KEL (§IDKRA CM I.IC VASTUS) 
FROM TUG GALAPAGOS ISLANDS. 

By DAVID S. JORDAN and CHARLES II. GILBERT. 

Sidera chlevastes sp. nov. (20385). 

Body little elongate, strongly compressed. Head rather small, some- 
what compressed. Teeth rather strong, most of them slender and sharp; 
their edges entire. Teeth of lower jaw uniserial, directed strongly 
backwards, close set, slightly increasing in size posteriorly; about 14 
on eaeli side. 

Teeth of upper jaw biserial, for most of its length; the teeth of the

inner series longer and depressible, longer than teeth of lower jaw. 
Vomer with a long, slender, median canine. 

Anterior nostril in a moderate tube ; posterior without tube, above 
front of eye. Mouth capable of being completely closed. Tip of lower 
jaw included. Eye rather large, placed midway between tip of snout 
and angle of mouth, its length about half that of snout ; cleft of mouth 
about half length of head. 

Dorsal fin rather high, beginning well in front of gill opening. Head 
2§ in trunk. Head and trunk a little shorter than tail. 

Color rather light yellowish brown, with about 20 blackish rings, 
which are usually about three times the breadth of the interspaces ; 
these rings are somewhat irregular, broadest above, becoming narrow 
below. They extend over the fins, and are very rarely confluent with 
each other. Tip of tail black. Head with 3i rings, which do not meet 
below. Tip of snout in one ring, the top and front of snout on median 
line pale. 

The typical specimen, 9 inches in length (20385 U. S. Nat. Mus.), was 
obtained at the Galapagos Islands Dy Captain Herendeen. 

We here use the name Sklera for those species of Murcena which have 
the posterior nostrils without tubes and the teeth all sharp. It is, there- 
fore, equivalent to the subgenus Gymnotliorax of Giinther, but as the 
proper type of Gymnotliorax Bloch is Murcena Helena L., the name should 
not be used for this division. 

The species of Sidera known from the Pacific coast of America may 
be thus compared : 

a. Dorsal beginning considerably before gill-opening. 

b. Body with many broad, blackish rings; teeth entire, those of upper jaw mostly 
biserial ; of lower, uniserial ; body strongly compressed.. Chlevastes. 
bb. Body without dark bands or rings; teeth mostly uniserial ; body not strongly 
compressed. 
c. Body and fins closely covered with irregular pale spots, around which the 
dark color forms reticulations ; dorsal and anal edged with black ; 
angle of mouth black ; larger teeth serrated on posterior margin ; 

head 1£ in trunk Ocellata." 

cc. Body with small yellowish spots ; nasal tubes short ; teeth entire Dovii.t

than length of snout ; width of head at front of eye equal to distance 
from tip of snout to posterior border of orbit. Rostral ridges moderately 
separated, slowly convergent anteriorly, but remaining separate as far 
as they can be traced. 

Mouth nearly straight, its breadth 2J in its distance from tip of snout. 
Length of nostril 1§ in breadth of mouth, its anterior valve narrow, 
extending but a slight distance towards the inner margin. Vent some- 
what nearer tip of snout than base of caudal. 

Dorsal fins similar, subequal, separated by an interspace which is 2| 
times the leugth of the first. Distance from posterior root of base of 
ventrals to first dorsal about equal to length of snout. Sides of tail 
with a conspicuous fold. 

Skin everywhere rough, with a fine, nearly uniform, shagreen. No 
spines along the rostral cartilages ; a row of very small superciliary 
spines; oue or two blunt spines on the shoulder- girdle; a series of low, 
bluntish spines along the median line of the back, becoming larger and 
farther apart posteriorly. Females without fimbriated appendage above 
tip of snout. 

Color light olivaceous gray ; translucent spaces on each side of snout 
becoming whitish in spirits, as in related species. Disk with a number 
of round, clear, slate-colored spots, as large as eye, these arranged sym- 
metrically ; one on middle of snout; one at the base of each rostral car- 
tilage ; a series of G or 7 forming an elliptical figure around each orbit ; 
one at base of each pectoral behind and outside each shoulder. Vertical 
fins and caudal fold pale. Lower side of disk pale; a large oblong, 
blackish blotch on lower side of tip of snout, extending backward nearly 
half waj r to mouth. Blackish blotches below on edge of base of snout 
sometimes present. 

This species is abundant in the astillero or estuary at Mazatlan, where 
it is known to the fishermen as "Guitarro." Several specimens were 
obtained by Professor Gilbert, the largest 2£ feet in length, all of them 
being females. These are numbered 28205, 28206, 20547, and 20602 
on the Museum Register. This species was at first identified by us 
with B. leucorhynchus, but the discovery by Professor Gilbert of the 
latter species at Panama shows that the Mazatlan form is distinct, 
although closely related. 

The color of It. glaucostigma is very peculiar and distinctive. The 
bluish spots do not disappear in spirits.

THE LIFE ( (HOKvi OF (RHM.\OBATi:s Ift IT EGKIPIIVNIS. 

By ROSA SMITH. 

The type sr^ecimens of this species were described (Proc. U. S. Nat. 
Mus., 1880, 147) after the color markings were changed from immersion 
in alcohol. The following description is made from two living ex- 
amples: Ground color, light purplish brown; top of head and snout, 
greenish yellow; a broad streak of coralline pink, closely resembling 
the color of Callithamnion heteromorplium, from eye across cheek and 
opercles; the base of the pectoral fin is of this color, outlined by a 
black crescent, beyond which the tips are transparent and pale green, 
dotted with black. On the side of body below lateral line are three 
orange-colored, nearly circular blotches, the anterior one overlapped 
but not entirely covered by the tips of the pectoral, the first spot equal- 
ing or larger than the orbit, the two posterior ones somewhat smaller. 
Dorsal fin with eight nearly square purple spots, alternating with lighter 
spaces of similar size and shape; the seventh dark dorsal spot is a 
green ocellus (black in the preserved specimen) encircled with a narrow 
ring of orange color and surrounded with very dark green, the ocellus 
covering the twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth dorsal spines. 
The lips are pale green. A white dot at base of occipital tentacle as 
large as pupil; minute white dots along lateral line from its origin to 
the pointof curvature, and a larger white dot close under the twenty- 
first or twenty-second dorsal spine. Anal fin marked with dark spots 
similarly to the dorsal and narrowly margined with white. Caudal 
transparent, pale green, dotted with black. Ventrals obscurely barred 
with black. Ventral surface lighter than sides of body. 

Lower rays of pectorals projecting beyond membrane, the upper rays 
much less projecting. 

Beginning of anal fin a little nearer tip of snout than base of caudal. 

The number of fin rays and all other characters agree with the original 
description. 

One of the present examples was taken February 6, 1883, with a dip- 
net, from a shallow tide pool about 4 by 6 feet in diameter, two or three 
miles distant from the locality where this species was discovered. The 
floor of the pool was of sand and no pools intervened between it and 
the sand beach, so that this one would be unsnrronnded with water at

every medium low tide. Plocamimn, coralline, and other algae, as well 
as Zostera, were growing on sides and bottom of the pool. Total length, 
2£ inches. 

A specimen, larger (2£ inches total length) than either of the type 
specimens, was collected at the first-known habitat on the 17th instant. 
It was in a large, deep pool, where the water was frequently changed 
by the breaking of the surf, under a heavy growth of "eel-grass" and 
sea-weeds. In addition to the species first found in company with 
Cremnobates, an adult example of Eeterostichus rostratus (Grd.) was 
taken. This fine specimen of Cremnobates was brought a distance of 
12 miles in about a pint of sea water, and lived 28 hours after it was 
captured.

NOTE OIV THE OCCURRENCE OE GASTEROSTEITS WIELIAMSONI 
GRD., IN AN ARTESIAN WELL AT SAN RE KNAR EM NO, CAL. 

By ROSA SMITH. 

Length, 1§ inches to base of caudal. Head, 2f in length ; depth, 3£ ; 
eye, 3 in head. 

Dorsal spines rather short; very slightly serrate; ventral spines 
reaching tip of pubic bone, serrate on both edges. The single specimen 
is so badly dried and decayed as to render it imx)ossible to count the 
soft rays of any of the fins except the pectoral ; the caudal fin is mostly 
broken off, and the anal spine is not discernible ; the second dorsal 
spine has come off and the third is very small. Pectoral rounded, of 
10 rays. The color is, of course, dark brown from drying. Some dark 
punctulations are seen, with a magnifying glass, on anterior part of 
body. Top of head, scapula, and suborbital bones, granulate ; opercles, 
striate. The pubic process, extending upward from ventral to middle 
of the side, is perpendicularly striate. 

After having become thoroughly dried the specimen was given to Mr. 
W. G. Wright, of San Bernardino, who preserved it in spirits. It is 
said to have emerged from the pipe of an artesian well from a depth of 
191 feet. Mr. Wright informs me that the pipe is so situated as to make 
it impossible for any one to have placed the fish in the pipe, as, after 
rising from the well 9 feet from the ground surface, the pipe is returned 
underground and runs horizontally a distance of 50 feet and then feeds 
a tank inside a building, the supposition being that the fish found its 
way into the well from some subterranean stream. 

The specimen has been presented to the United States National Mu- 
seum. 

The species is evidently a true Gasterosteus and not an "Eucalia? 
It is closely related to G. microcephalus, but lacks the lateral plates of 
that species.

LIST OF THE CRUSTACEA DREDGED ON THE COAST OF LABRA- 
DOR BY THE EXPEDITION UNDER THE DIRECTION OF XV. A. 

STEARNS, IN 1882. 

By SIDNEY I. SMITH. 

The collection, the Crustacea from which are here enumerated, was 
made in August, 1882, by an expedition under the direction of Mr. W. 
A. Stearns. The dredgings, which were all in shallow water, were 
made by Messrs. Stearns, B. S. Barrows, Edwin B. Flint, J. A. Allen, 
and Charles L. Flint, jr. The collection was made at different points 
along the coast from Forteau Bay to Dead Island. The principal local- 
ities are: Forteau Bay, about north latitude 51° 30', west longitude 56° 
55' ; L'anse an Loup, about 51° 33' and 56° 48' ; Temple Bay, about 52° 
2' and 55° 55' ; Henley Harbor, near the mouth of Temple Bay ; Fox 
Harbor, on Saint Lewis Sound; and Dead Island, near Square Island, 
about 52° 48' and 55° 48'. A part of the specimens were sent to the 
Museum of Yale College by Messrs. Barrows and Allen, of the Sheffield 
Scientific School, and the rest were sent to the National Museum by Mr. 
Stearns. Both parts of the collection are combined in the following list. 

The preparation of this list has involved a more or less critical exam- 
ination of the lists of Crustacea of the same region given by Professor 
Packard, aud, having had access to a set of the specimens upon which 
Professor Packard's work was based, I have attempted to revise the 
marine Crustacea of his lists, and have embodied this revision in a cat- 
alogue of all the species known from the Labrador coast, which is given 
in the paper following the present list.

and horizontal. Although all the specimens are rather large, seven of 
them haye only three teeth on the dorsal crest, two on the carapax, and 
one on the rostrum, while the other specimen has but four teeth in all. 
Two of the specimens have a well-developed epipod at the base of one 
of the third pair of legs, one has a well-developed epipod at the base of 
each of the third pair of legs, while the other specimens are, as usual, 
without epipods at the bases of the third pair of legs. In other respects 
the specimens are normal. These characters, with the length, are shown 
for each specimen in the following table:

REVIEW OF THE MARINE CRUSTACEA OF LABRADOR 

By SIDNEY I. SHUT II. 

Almost the only source of information in regard to the crustacean 
fauna of 1 be coast of Labrador lias been Professor Packard's "A list 
of the animals dredged near Caribou island, southern Labrador, during 
July and August, I860" (Canadian Naturalist and Geologist, viii, pp. 
401-420 (1-29), December, 18G3), and his "View of the recent inver- 
tebrate fauna of Labrador" (Memoirs Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., i, pp. 
262-303, pll. 7, 8, 1807). At the time these papers were written it was 
exceedingly difficult in this country to identify the marine invertebrata 
of our northern coast, and the lists of Crustacea given by Professor 
Packard were necessarily very imperfect ; the species described as new 
had apparently all been previously described by European authors ; the 
identifications were in many cases incorrect; and in several cases the 
same species appears under different names. Of this last class of errors 
several are due to the fact that some of the Amphipoda were identi- 
fied for Professor Packard by Dr. Axel Boeck, others were deter- 
mined by comparison with Arctic specimens from Dr. Liitken, of 
Copenhagen, while still others were determined from the published 
descriptions by American and European authors. In the following 
pages I have attempted not only to revise Professor Packard's 
lists, but also to give a complete catalogue of all the species known 
from the Labrador coast. In determining Professor Packard's species 
I have been greatly aided by a set of his specimens collected in 1864 
and labeled by him for the Museum of Yale College. This collection 
has enabled me to determine many of the species enumerated by Pro- 
fessor Packard which were otherwise indeterminable, and also to add 
a number of species overlooked or incorrectly determined by him. The 
nomenclature adopted for the Amphipoda is mainly that of Boeck 
(Skandinaviske og Arktiske Amphipoder), and for the Isopoda that of 
Harger (Marine Isopoda of New England, Beport U. S. Fish Com., part 
iv, for 1878). I have not attempted to give synonymy except to show 
to what species the names in Professor Packard's lists are referred, but 
I have intended to insert references to all the names of marine species 
in each of his lists. For the distribution of the species along the Lab- 
rador coast I have thought it sufficient to indicate only whether the 
species has been found on the Gulf or Atlantic coast, or on both coasts, 
and for this purpose I arbitrarily divide the coast at 51° 50' north lati- 
tude, a little south of Chateau and Temple Bays, regarding all south 
and west of this point as Gulf coast and all north of it as Atlantic

Bell (8. inflatus Kroyer) ; so that it might appear doubtful what species 
Packard included under il Anonyx ampulla (Phipps) " were it not that 
lie says that it was " compared with arctic specimens received from 
Copenhagen," which seems to leave no doubt that he really had in view 
Anonyx nugax, although he subsequently, as indicated above, enumer- 
ates this same species under two other names. 

Anonyx pumulus Lilljeborg. 

"Anonyx producta, fide Boeck," Packard, Mom. Post. Soc. Nat. Hist., p. 301,

I have seen no specimens. The species is placed immediately after 
" Anonyx Horringii " by Packard, who says only " these two forms were 
found together in fifteen fathoms, sand," although under the first of the 
two species he has nothing except the remark, "A common form, occur- 
ring abundantly on the coast of Maine, in Casco Bay, ten fathoms." 

Onisimus Edwardsii Boeck (Kroyer). 

Atlantic coast ! (Packard's collection.) This species is not mentioned 
by Packard, but a single specimen of it was sent, with Anonyx nugax, 
by him to the Museum of Yale College. In the form of the epimeron of 
the third somite of the abdomen, however, this specimen does not 
agree fully with Kroyer's figure in the Voyages en Scandinavie, nor with 
Boeck's diagnosis, but with Miers's description and figure (Ann. Mag. 
Nat. Hist., IV, xx, p. 99, 1877), the acute postero-lateral angle of the 
epimeron being slightly upturned. 

Orchomene minutus Boeck (Kroyer). 

Atlantic coast! (Stearns exped.). Not mentioned by Packard, but all 
the specimens sent to the Museum of Yale College as u Anonyx Hor- 
ringii 71 are apparently of this species, which occurs upon the New 
England coast, and is sometimes very abundant in Vineyard Sound 
in winter. 

Tryphosa Horingii Boeck. 

? "Anonyx Horringii, fide Boeck," Packard, Mem. Post. Soc. Nat. Hist., i, p.

Boeck undoubtedly had specimens of this species from Packard's col- 
lection, for he (Skandinaviske og ArktiskeAmphipoder, p. 184) distinctly 
mentions it as having been found in Labrador by Packard, but, as just 
noticed, all the specimens sent by Packard under the above name to 
the Museum of Yale College belong to Boeck's genus Orchomene, so that 
it is very doubtful if the "common form, occurring abundantly on the 
coast of Maine," was the same species as the specimens sent to Boeck.

were most likely from Henley Harbor, as that is the only locality given

Atlantic coast ! (Packard). 

The specimens sent to Europe and identified by Boeck as above 
quoted by Packard were undoubtedly Pontogenia inermis, but the spe- 
cies described and figured by Packard under the name given by Boeck 
is certainly distinct from that species. Two specimens which were evi- 
dently supposed by Packard to be the species described by him were 
sent to the Museum of Yale College under a manuscript name as a new 
species of Atylus: oue of these specimens, as stated above, is Pleustes 
bicuspis, and is evidently not the species described and figured by 
Packard; the other specimen is Halirages fulvocinctus, aud is, I thiuk, 
the species described and figured by him. Packard describes his spe- 
cies as having "the first three abdominal segments produced iuto three 
strongly-hooked projections, the third of which is much the largest; 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 229 

fourth segment deeply, broadly sinuate": but, as his figure shows, it is 
the last thoracic and first two abdominal somites which are produced, 
and the fourth abdominal which is sinuate. Excepting this and the 
rounded instead of angular abdominal epimera, the description and 
figure agree with Haliragesfulvocinctus.

NOTES ON THE FISHES OF TODOSI SANTOS BAY, LOWER CALI- 
FORNIA. 

By ROSA SMITH. 

During the past winter (1882-'83) the writer, with a party of natural* 
ists, spent three weeks on Todos Santos Bay and points northward to 
San Diego. 

The bay of Todos Santos has a shore line of about forty miles, a little 
more than half of it being a smooth sand-beach, the remainder bluffs of 
dark red or blackish lava, extending into the sea at intervals, forming- 
rocky tide-pools, interspersed with longer or shorter shingle beaches. 
About 20 miles below the town of Ensenada the land slopes gently to 
and below the sea-level, allowing the water to cover the shallower por- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 233 

tions, forming lagoons and creeks. A small group of picturesque rocks 
affords the only protection to the bay on its western side at a distance 
of 10 miles from Ensenada. 

Having a low tide during our stay, the rock pools were thoroughly 
searched with dip-nets, aud many heavy stones overturned. 

At Punta Banda, on the southern shore of the bay, lives George Tan 
uahill, a Scottish fisherman, who has built a small hut of water- worn 
bowlders on the shiugle beaeh, where he spends, with his family, a few 
months of the year "fishing for a pastime," as he told me. He had on 
hand two species of fishes (Troehocopus pulcher and Serranw clathratus). 
He formerly dried the " red-fish" for exportation, but now no regular 
fishing is done anywhere on the bay. He gave me the common names 
of thirteen species, which may be referred to the species in this list 
which are marked with an asterisk, and which are accompanied by the 
common names used by Mr. Tannahill.

6. Gasterosteus microcephalus Grd. 

At the Tia Juana Hot Springs, about ."> miles below the boundary line, 
this species is abundant in a stream of somewhat warm mineral water, 
in company with water-beetles, snails, and other animal forms, and well- 
shielded by growing water-cress, Azolla, and an alga. This stickleback 
also occurs in Wild Cat Canon, a few miles further south. D. 1, 1, I.

15 miles below the boundary line and near the Coronado Islands. The 
beach at this point is of firm, light brown sand, and the rocky cliff be- 
hind the sand strip is red volcanic rock. A few rocks jut into the sea, 
entirely destitute of life except for the abundant mussels and a very 
little thread like sea-weed.

24. Isesthes gilberti Jordan. 

Among ten specimens of Isesthes from Todos Santos Bay, the largest 
measures 5£ inches; head, 4£; depth, 4£; D. XII, 18; A. 21. Five 
other specimens (smaller) have the same fin formula. A specimen, 2£ 
inches in length, has D. XII, 16 ; A. 20; while another somewhat larger 
has D. XI, 19 ; A. 21, and an individual less than two inches long has 
D. XII, 16; A. 19; the orbital tentacles of this last being only trifid in- 
stead of multifid, the gill-opening, as in all from this locality, extending 
downward to lower edge of pectoral. The color of the largest speci- 
men is dull olivaceous, all the markings more obscure than in smaller 
ones. A specimen 2J inches long has the following life markings: a 
black spot, larger than pupil, on second dorsal spine ; eight or nine 
small blue dots on median line of side (below lateral line), from pectoral 
to caudal; ground color of head bluish gray, finely dotted with red- 
dish; two black stripes downward and forward from eye, the first 
meeting the one from opposite side close behind symphysis of lower 
jaw, the second meeting on throat; tentacles multifid.

plain purplish brown, and others inhabiting deep pools with a heavy 
growth of Zostera were, in life, of a vivid green, with about four hori- 
zontal stripes of lighter green, silvery patches shining through on the 
inferior stripes. As usual, two brown ocelli margined with a ring of 
red were placed one at a distance of its own diameter behind the mar- 
gin of opercular flap, the other as far below the dorsal fin and under 
its posterior half. In the specimens examined the dorsal fin rays vary 
from V, XXVIII, 6 to V, XXXI, 0, the anal usually having twenty-four 
articulate rays, occasionally as few as twenty-three or as many as twenty- 
six, the anal spines always numbering two.

CATALOGUE OF nOLLl'SCA AIVD EfHINODERTIATA DREDGED OIV 
THE COAST OF LABRADOR BV THE EXPEDITION UNDER THE 
DIRECTION OF JIR. W. A. STEARNS. IN lSSvi. 

By KATHARINE J. BUSH. 

The collection upon which the following catalogue is based was 
obtained by the expedition of 1882, under the direction of Mr. W. A. 
•Stearns. Part of the specimens were sent to the Peabody Museum of 
Yale College by Messrs. B. S. Barrows and J. A. Allen, and the rest to 
the National Museum .by Mr. Stearns. 

The dredging was done mostly by Mr. Stearns, Mr. B. S. Barrows, 
and Mr. Edwin R. Flint; but Messrs. J. A. Allen and Charles L. Flint, 
jr., assisted in this work. 

The dredgings were made during the month of August, in shallow 
water, at different points along the coast included between Forteau Bay 
and Dead Island. The principal localities are L'anse au Loup, north 
latitude 51° 33', west longitude 50° 48' ; Henley Harbor, about north 
latitude 52° 05', west longitude 55° 51' ; Dead Island, near Square 
Island, north latitude 52° 18', west longitude 55° 48'. 

The nomenclature adopted is mostly the same as that of the Prelimi- 
nary Check-list of the Marine Invertebrata of the Atlantic Coast, and 
the Catalogue of Marine Mollusca by Prof. A. F. Yerrill.* The names 
used in Binney's edition of Gould's Invertebrata of Massachusetts are 
added in parenthesis when different from those adopted. 

For such species as are not included in Gould's report, references 
have been given to at least one work in which the species is described 
or figured. 

A list of the species found by Prof. A. S. Packard, jr., t during the 
summer of 1804, but not obtained by the Stearns expedition, has been 
appended to the catalogues, both of mollusca and eehinodermata, to 
make the faunal lists more complete.

LIST OF FISHES COLLECTED IN THE CLEAR FORK OF THE CUM- 
BERLAND, WHITLEY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, WITH DESCRIPTIONS 
OF THREE NEW SPECIES. 

By DAVID S.JORDAN and JOSEPH SWAIN. 

In May, 1883, the writers, aided by a party of students from Indiana 
University, made a small collection of fishes in the Clear Fork of the 
Cumberland Eiver, and in its tributaries, Wolf Creek and Brier Creek, 
near Pleasant View, Whitley County, Kentucky. The following is a 
list of the species obtained, three of which appear to be new to science. 
Typical examples of these have been presented to the National Museum. 

1. Amiurus natalis (Le Sueur) Jordan. 

2. Catostornus teres (Mitcliill) Le Sueur. 

The use of the name commersoni for this species is probably unfortu- 
nate. La Cepede's Cyprinus commersoni may have been this species, but 
that it was so cannot be proven. It is therefore best to use the oldest 
name of certain application. 

3. Catostornus nigricans Le Sueur. 

4. Moxostoma velatum (Cope) Jordan. 

One fine large specimen. 

5. Moxostoma macrolepidotum duquesnei (Le Sueur) Jordan. 
Very common in the Clear Fork. 

6. Campostoma anomalum (Raf.) Agassiz. 

7. Chrosomus erythrogaster Raf. 

Very abundant in the smaller streams. The males were in very high 
coloration, having the dorsal and the'lower fins bright golden yellow, 
the snout and caudal reddish. In some specimens the black lateral 
bands were coalescent on the caudal peduncle and partially so on the 
trunk. These specimens apparently correspond to the description of 
Chrosomus eos Cope. In this case, however, it is evidently a color vari- 
ation of G. erythrogaster. 

8. Hyborhynchus notatus (Raf.) Ag. 

Very common. The males with tuberculate muzzles have the skin at 
the angle of the mouth swollen a little in the form of a small flap or 
barbel. This structure is apparently not homologous with the barbel 
in Rhinicltthys and related genera, but is rather a thickening of the skin 
accompanying the nuptial excrescences of the males. On this character 
the nominal species, Hyborhynchus superciliosus Cope was founded. 

9. Ericymba buccata Cope. 

Very abundant in small streams. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 249 

10. Minnilus diplaemius (Raf.) Hay. 
Abundant. 

11. Minnilus cornutus (Mitcbill) Jordan & Gilb. 

Not rare. 

12. Hemitremia vittata Cope. 

Several specimens, which we refer with some doubt to this species, 
were taken in Wolf Creek and the Clear Fork. The scales are larger 
than in Cope's type and the teeth are in normal number (4-4), not 4-5 
or 5-5 as stated by Professor Cope. 

The following characters are shown by our specimens : 
Olivaceous, the scales above punctate with black; sides with a narrow 
and very distinct black lateral band, narrower than the eye, extending 
from snout to base of caudal, where it ends in a distinct oblong black 
spot; caudal, dull reddish; other fins plain. Head 4, depth 3f, A. 7, 
Lat. 1. about 32, the exact number not easily counted. Tubes of lateral 
line little developed. Dorsal iuserted a little before ventrals, slightly 
nearer snout than base of caudal ; mouth very small, terminal. Snout 
short and blunt ; head thick, broad above; pectorals not reaching ven- 
trals, the latter slightly beyond front of anal; scales before dorsal^ 
large. The largest specimens seen were scarcely two inches long. The 
young have the lateral band faint or wanting. 

13. Rhinichthys obtusus Agassiz. 

Common in cold clear streams. 

14. Ambloplites rupestris (Raf.) Gill. 

15. Lepomis megalotis Rafinesque. 

16. Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque. 

17. Lepomis cyanellus Rafinesque. 

18. Micropterus dolomiei La Cepede. 

19. Alvordius aspro Cope aud Jordan. 
In the Clear Fork. 

20. Diplesium blennioidss (Raf.) .Tor. 

In the river channel. The specimen taken was very slender, without 
red or orange markings in life. 

21. Eoleosoma susanae, sp. nov. 

Head, 4i; depth, Gi. D. VIII, 10 or 11. A. 1, 8. Lat. 1.45. Length 
of largest specimen, 2 inches. 

General form and appearance of Boleosoma nigrum, but with the body 
slenderer, the fins smaller, and the head entirely naked. 

Body very slender, fusiform, little compressed, the back not much 
elevated. Head short and small. Mouth small, inferior, formed as in 
other species of the genus. Snout short, bluntly decurved. Eye rather 
large, a little longer than snout, the maxillary extending to below front 



250 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

of pupil. Whole head, nape, breast, and middle line of belly naked. 
Scales rather large, the tubes of the lateral line wanting on the last 
three or four. Fins moderate, the dorsals shorter and lower than usual 
in this genus, highest in the males. Anal spine single, weak. Pec- 
torals rather long, reaching well beyond tips of ventrals, their length 
about equal to that of head. 

Color in life essentially as in Boleosoma nigrum, the males (in spring) 
with the head and fins jet black, the body blackish olive, barred with 
black. 

Females light olive, tessellated with darker, and with dusky spots 
along the lateral line. A dark spot before eye and one on back before 
dorsal; lower fins pale; both dorsals and caudal with darker bars. 

This little fish is abundant in the tributaries of the Clear Fork of the 
Cumberland. Most of the numerous types were taken in Wolf Creek. 
It is named for Mrs. Susan Bowen Jordan. 

22. Pcecilichthys sagitta, sp. nov. 

Head, 3±; depth, 4f. D. X— 13. A. I, 10. Lat. 1. about 68 (48 
tubes). Length of typical example, 2£ inches. 

Body rather slender, compressed, the back a little elevated, the caudal 
peduncle rather long and not very deep. Head very long and slender, 
eel like, tapering forward to a sharp snout, its depth at the pupil about 
one third its length. Interorbital space narrow. Snout about as long 
as eye; 5 in head. Mouth very large for the genus, oblique, the maxil- 
lary reaching to below front of pupil, 3£ in head. Jaws subequal in 
front, upper jaw not protractile ; teeth rather strong. No scales on 
cheeks, opercles, or breast; nape covered with small scales. Opercular 
spine well developed. Gill membranes scarcely connected. 

Scales on body small, firm, ctenoid. Humerus with its margin black, 
scarcely enlarged. Lateral line nearly straight, becoming obsolete under 
last rays of second dorsal. Belly covered with ordinary scales. 

Dorsal spines slender, rather high. Soft dorsal rather higher, its base 
shorter. Anal nearly equal to soft dorsal, its base somewhat shorter, 
its rays a little higher. Anal spine slender, single in the typical exam- 
ple, the normal number probably two. Caudal truncate, 1£ in head, 
about as long as the ventrals, which are rather shorter than the pec- 
torals. 

Color in life, dusky green, with markings of darker olive, the latter 
forming about nine obscure cross-bars, which are about as wide as the 
interspaces, these most distinct posteriorly and below the lateral line. 
A dusky spot at base of caudal. A roundish orange spot in each of 
the pale interspaces between the bars along the sides. Some minute 
orange spots above the lateral line. A narrow black streak along-side 
of head through eye. A pink spot in front of eye above. Snout tinged 
with orange. First dorsal translucent, with a narrow edge of orange. 
Soft dorsal translucent, speckled with dusky and pale orange. Tail 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 251 

with three or four alternate bars of orange and dusky olive, the mark- 
ing not very sharp. Pectorals similarly but more faintly marked, orange 
at base. Anal and ventrals colorless. Breast not blue or orange. 

A single specimen was obtained in Wolf Creek. 

This species bears little relationship to any of those referred to Peeci- 
lichthy.s, in Jordan & Gilbert's Synopsis of the Fishes of North America. 
It has, however, the technical characters of the genus in which we here 
place it. Its long, naked, tapering head is its most striking peculiarity. 

23. Etheostoma cumberlandicum, sp. nov. 

Closely related to E.l flabelarc Eaf, but with thicker head and differ- 
ent coloration. 

Head, 3§; depth, of. D. VIII, 11. A. II, 7. Lat. 1. 45, the tubes 
on 15 to 20 scales. Length, 2f inches. 

Body moderately elongate, somewhat compressed, the back little ele- 
vated. Head unusually thick and heavy, little tapering anteriorly, 
much stouter than in E. flabellare. Mouth terminal, very oblique, the 
lower jaw somewhat projecting. Eye about as long as snout, 4J in 
head, the maxillary extending nearly to below its middle. Teeth rather 
stroug. Head, nape, and breast naked. Belly and region along dorsal 
with the scales small. 

Scides of body smoother than in E. flabellare, and more loosely imbri- 
cated, especially in the adult. Fins essentially as in other species, the 
dorsal spines low and subequal, lowest in the male, the flesh at their 
tips being thickened. Caudal large, rounded. Other fins moderate. 

Color in life greenish, semi-translucent, the body in the adult without 
trace of liues, cross-bars, or spots, excepting the large, black humeral 
spot ; back with a few faint, dusty cross-shades. Young with tessellated 
spots, and numerous faint cross-bars, which are developed chiefly as a 
series of spots along the lateral line. A dark streak from eye through 
snout; a round, black spot behind eye. First dorsal translucent, 
abruptly edged with black, the free tips of the spines golden orange. 
Second dorsal obliquely barred with alternating bands of black and 
golden. Caudal pale, with about seven very sharply defined curved 
cross-bands of black. Pectorals olivaceous, scarcely barred, an orange 
bar at base. Ventrals and anal plain, slightly dusky. 

This little fish is excessively abundant in all the small streams of the 
Cumberland Mountains. Numerous examples were taken in Wolf 
Creek, Briar Creek, &c. Others were seen in the Clear Fork, Yellow 
Creek, Gap Creek, &c. In all these streams this is the most abundant 
of the Darters. 

It should, perhaps, be considered a local variety of E. flabellare, but 
a larger intermediate series is necessary before this view can be taken.

A DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES OF IIADROPTERl'S (HADROP- 
TERUS SCIERUS) FKO.11 SOUTHERN INDIANA. 

By JOSEPH SWAIN. 

Hadropterus scierus, sp. uov. 

Head, 4 (4£); depth, 5 (6); length of typical example, 3£ inches. D. 
XIII, 14. A. II, 9. Scales, 7-65-11. 

Body robust, rather compressed behind. Head rather short; snout 
bluntish, 3i in head. Mouth small, the lower jaw included. Maxillary 
not reaching the eye by about the width of the pupil. Diameter of eye 
scarcely equal to length of snout, 4£ in head. Gill membranes broadly 
connected. Lateral line straight, complete, not prolonged forward to 
the eye. Opercle covered with rather large scales ; cheeks with slightly 
smaller ones ; a triangular area on the breast, in front of the ventral 
fins, with imbedded scales ; the breast otherwise almost naked ; throat 
naked ; scales persistent, on middle line of belly little enlarged, one 
enlarged plate being present between the ventral fins; body otherwise 
covered with rather small ctenoid scales. 

Fins all very large. The spinous dorsal separated from the soft dor- 
sal by the length of the snout. Outline of the spinous dorsal gently 
curved, the first spine one-third longer than last spine, and two-thirds 
length of middle spine, which is If in head. Base of soft dorsal longer 
than that of anal, its rays of about equal length, 1| in head ; anal about 
as large as soft dorsal ; ventrals about equal to pectorals, which are 1 J 
in head. 

Color in spirits, yellowish olive, everywhere vaguely blotched with 
black. Top of head, dorsal, anal, and ventral fins entirely black (proba- 
bly pale in the female). Base of pectoral and caudal fins, branchioste- 
gal membrane, cheeks, and sides posteriorly, blackish. Scales every- 
where finely punctulate with brown, the sides with a few larger black 
specks. 

This fish is known at present from only two specimens taken in Bean 
Blossom Creek, Monroe County, Indiana, about six miles north of 
Bloomington. The stream is a tributary of White River. 

This species differs from the others referred to Hadropterus in having 
the gill-membranes broadly united. In the arrangement given in Jor- 
dan & Gilbert's Synopsis of the Fishes of North America it would, there- 
fore, stand as the type of a new genus. It is, however, evidently closely 
related to Hadropterus nigrofasciatus, from which species it cannot prop- 
erly be generically separated.

IJIU;\Oslw OF NEW GENERA AM) SPECIES OF DEEP-SEA FISH- 
LIKE VERTEBRATES. 

By THEODORE GILL. 

The explorations of the United States Fish Commission steamer 
Albatross, under the command of Capt. Z. L. Tanner, were unusually 
successful during the past summer, in the discovery of hitherto unknown 
species and higher types of fishes, as well as other animals. At the 
invitation of the Commissioner, Professor Baird, I have examined the 
collection made during the several trips of the year, and have found no 
less than eighteen new species of fish-like vertebrates — one Myzont, one 
Selachian, and sixteen true Fishes. Diagnoses of most of these are here 
given, but those of four others — one Eurypharyngoid and three Xemich- 
thyoid fishes — will be immediately published in other articles by the 
present author in conjunction with Mr. John A. Ryder, whose skill as 
an anatomist, as well as an artist, has rendered his aid invaluable. 
Hereafter, more full descriptions and illustrations will be given of the 
forms now diagnosed.

cent. 

Inasmuch as the character which thus distinguishes the species con- 
tradicts the generic diagnosis attributed to the genus by Giiuther, Jor- 
dan and Gilbert, and other ichthyologists, it may be at least subgener- 
ically distinguished, on account of the obsolescence of the denticles, 
under the name Bathymyzon.

CHBIAERIDyE. 

Chimasra abbreviata. 

The snout is moderately produced and the subrostral contour very 
oblique ; the ante-orbital flexure of the suborbital line ascends almost 
as high as the upper margin of the pupil ; the dorsals are scarcely sep- 
arated by an interspace and the spine of the first is acutely angulated 
and keeled in front; the pectorals extend nearly to the inner axils of 
the veutrals ; the latter are acutely angulated; the tail is abbreviated 
and only about as long as the head (from the snout to the transverse 
nuchal line); the color is dark yellow (in life) or brownish, while the

Halosaurus Goodei. 

B. 12. D. I. 10-11. V. I. 8. 

The snout is moderately produced, its preoral portion forming two- 
sevenths (II. m. |) of its length ; the eye is small, equal to one-hith (H. 
m. -£) of the postocular portion of the head, and less than one-half (1 : 2A 
e. H. m. 1 : 2) of the width of the interorbital space. The head is longer 
than the distance between it and the root of the ventral; the supra- 
maxillary reaches the vertical of the front margin of the eye ; the dorsal 
is entirely behind the ventrals; the anal commences as far behind the 
root of the ventrals as the latter is behind the preoperculum ; the pec- 
torals nearly reach backward to the ventrals; the squamation is similar 
to that of the H. macrochir. 

This species has been confounded with the H. macrochir by previous 
writers, and it is certainly very nearly related to it, but it appears to 
be specifically separable by the number of rays in the dorsal and ventral 
tins and the proportions of those parts contrasted above. I take pleasure 
in dedicating it to my friend, Prof. G. Brown Goode, who first, in uuion 
with Dr. Bean, determined its existence, as well as its near relationship 
to It. macrochir.

The color is black. The dorsal fin has three spines arid sixteen rays, 
and the anal one spine and eight rays. Two spines — one on each side of 
the nape — springing forward from the shoulder bones, give a strange 
appearance to the fish, and have gained for it the generic name Plec-

DIAGNOSES OF NEW GEIVERA OF IVEMICHTHYOIO EELS. 

By THEODORE GILL an«l JOIIX A. RYDER. 

Hitherto only three species have been recognized among the Nemich- 
thyoid eels — three species of Xemichthys (N. scolopaceus, N. avocetta, and 
X. infansj and one representing an isolated type that possibly repre- 
sents another family — the genus Cyema of Dr. Giinther. But the trawl- 
ing operations of the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross 
were rewarded in 1883 by the finding of not less than four species rep- 
resenting three hitherto unknown modifications of structure necessi- 
tating generic distinction. One of these forms was in most respects 
closely allied to the ordinary long known type, but the other two were 
very different. Diagnoses of the new types are here offered in advance 
of the publication of more detailed descriptions and illustrations at 
some other time. 

SERRI VOMER. 

Nemichthyids with the head behind eyes of an elongated parallelo- 
gramic form, with moderately attenuated jaws, branchiostegal mem- 
brane confluent at posterior margin, but with the branchial apertures 
limited by an isthmus except at the margin, and with lancet-shaped 
vomerine teeth in a crowded (sometimes doubled) row.

The stoutest of the family and with much shorter jaws than any other, 
and with a very formidable vomerine armature. The total length of 
the single specimen obtained was .594 of a meter; its height at the 
vertical of the mandibular articulation is .01G m., and the greatest 
height of the body (just behind the branchial apertures) is .02 m.

Nemichthyids with a rectilinear occipito-rostral outline, with very

Spinivomer Goodei. 
D. . A. . 



The smallest of the family, but a beautiful silvery form. The total 
length of the only specimen found is .13 of a meter, and its greatest 
height (at the branchial region) is .0025 m. 

The rays are enshea^hed in a tough membrane which renders it im- 
possible at present to enumerate them with exactitude. They are, how- 
ever, it is to be noted, more distant from each other, and consequently 
fewer than in Serrivomer. 

The fish has a silvery sheen by which, as well by the smaller eyes and 
deeper mandibles, it may be at once recognized from its relations.

Ort THE ANATOMY AIVU BELATSC^'S OF THE ECRVPHARYIVGID.E. 

By TSJE©I>ORE GILL afiaal JOHN A. RYDER. 

The remarkable fish called Eury pharynx was one of the fruits of the ex- 
plorations of the French vessel Travailleur in 1882. A single specimen 
about a foot and a half long was obtained off the coast of Morocco at 
a depth of 2,300 meters (about 1,100 fathoms), and has been partially 
described by M. L. Vaillant under the name Enrypharynx pelecanoid.es. 

Three specimens of the same general type of fishes were found by the 
United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross in August and Sep- 
tember, 1883, and might be considered to be generically and even 
specifically identical with Eurypharynx pclecanoides were it not for sev- 
eral positive statements made by the describer of that species. 

The problem of the relations of Eurypharnyx to other fishes has 
been discussed by 3VL Vaillant with what appears to us to be negative 
results and one set of conclusions necessarily contravenes another. But 
it is only just to M. Vaillant to let the opinions as to the affinity of the 
fish enunciated by him be presented in his own language: 

" We may say that the fish presents relations with the Anacanthini, 
with certain Physostomi, such as the Scopelidaeand Stomiatida 1 , and also 
with the Apodes. While it resembles these last in the want of ventral 
fins and the imperfection of the opercular apparatus, it differs from them 
too much in its well-developed and absolutely free iutermaxillaries to 
allow it to be placed in the same group. As regards the Scopelkhr- and 
Stomiatida 1 , all the known genera in those families have a very widely 
open branchial orifice: in the former the intermaxillary alone forms 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MU8F.UM. 263 

the free border of the upper jaw ; in the latter the maxillary forms part 
of it : and thus it would be the Scopelidse that Eurypliarynx would ap- 
proach, especially as it does not present the hyoidean barbel which has 
hitherto been indicated as characteristic of the Stomiatidse. 

" However, of all fishes it is to Malacosteus niger, Ayres, placed in 
the latter family by zoologists, that Ave are tempted to approximate the 
animal here under consideration; they alone present the simple arrange- 
ments of the suspensorium indicated above. 

" But, finally, it is perhaps with the Anacantliini that its relations seem 
to be most real, whether we consider the form of the body, which greatly 
resembles that of Macrurus, or the absence of ventral fins, which is 
usual in certain animals of the group; thus several Ophid ida> and all 
the Lycodidse (the latter even having their branchial orifice reduced, 
although not to the degree that occurs in our animal) increase the prob- 
ability attaching to this view. However, the characters of Eurypha- 
rynx are so strongly marked that in any case it is necessary to regard it 
as the type of a new family; and of this it would be the sole represent- 
ative, unless subsequent investigations show that we must unite with 
it the genus Malacosteus." — (Vaillant, op.cit.J 

We are unable to appreciate any affinity of Gastrostomus to any Ana- 
canthines, Physostomes, or typical Apods, nor does it seem to be at all 
related to Malacosteus, which has been universally considered to be a 
little modified Stomiatid. Our own conclusions are expressed in the 
following arrangement. 

The characters observed in the specimens collected by the Albatross 
may be segregated into several categories — (1) those disagreeing with 
structural characters exhibited by all normal Teleosts and which are 
paramount even to the characters usually considered to be of ordinal 
value; (2) those presumably common to the western and eastern Atlantic 
forms and which may be regarded as of family value; and (3) the char- 
acters alleged to be peculiar to Eurypharynx on one hand and on the 
other confirmed as to their discrepancy in the American form. In this 
order we here expose the cardinal characteristics of the Eurypharyn- 
goid fishes in advance of a monograph in which we propose to describe 
and illustrate in detail their morphology, and discuss their relationship 
to other fishes, and especially to the Saccopharyngids and eel like types 
generallv. 

ORDER LYOMERI. 

Fishes with five branchial arches* (none modified as branchiostegal 
or pharyngeal) far behind the skull; an imperfectly ossified cranium, 
articulating with the first vertebra by a basi-occipital condyle alone; 
only two cephalic arches, both freely movable, (1) an anterior denti- 
geroua one — the palatine, and (2) the suspensorial, consisting of the

tinct posterior bony elements to the mandible; with an imperfect scap- 
ular arch remote from the skull; and with separately ossified but im- 
perfect vertebrae, t

Eurypharyngidae Gill, Science, v. 1, p. 231, March 30, 188:5. 

Lyomeres with the head flat above and with a transverse rostral margin, 
at the outer angles of which the eyes are exposed, with the jaws exces- 
sively elongated backwards and the upper parallel and closing against 
each other as far as the articulation of the two suspensorial bones, with 
minute teeth on both jaws, with a short abdomen and long attenuated 
tail, branchial apertures nasrow and very far behind, dorsal and anal 
fins continued nearly to the end of the tail, and minute pectoral fins. 

The mandibular rami are exceedingly narrow and slender, but the 
jaws are extremely expansible and the skin is correspondingly dilatable ; 
consequently au enormous pouch may be developed. Inasmuch as the 
slenderness and fragility of the jaws and the absence of raptorial teeth 
(at least in Gastrostomus) preclude the idea of the species being true 
fish of prey, it is probable that they may derive their food from the 
water which is received into the pouch, by a process of selection of the 
small or minute organisms therein contained. 

The peculiar closure of the anterior half of the upper jaws upon each 
other, and the co-ordinate joint between the hyomaiidibular and quad- 
rate elements of the suspensorium are doubtless correlated with the 
mode of ingestion or selection of food. The skin constituting the pouch, 
it may be added, has a peculiar velvety appearance, and also reminds 
one of the patagium or wing membrane of a bat. But a more detailed 
summary of the salient characteristics of the type may be justly de- 
manded at once. 

OSTEOLOGY. 

The skeleton is noteworthy for its simplicity or rather fewness of its 
parts, but the homologies of these parts are, for that very reason, not 
evident at first sight. We necessarily confine our attention to Gastros- 
tomy*, as the parts of Eurypharynx have not yet been described or 
figured. 

The cranium above is really pentagonal, but apparently, in the main, 
transversely quadrate, expanding backwards around the foramen mag- 
num (which is conspicuous from above) and forwards into the ethmoid 
expansion, which is separated from the main portion by a straugula- 



* -We find neither hyoidean apparatus nor opercular pieces." — Vaillant. 
t "It is important to indicate the complete absence of the swimming bladder."' — 
Vaillant. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 265 

tion ; below it appears to have more of a pentagonal outline on account 
of the less irregularity of the surface near the contour. 

The notockord is persistent in the skull for half the length of the basi- 
oecipital. 

The occipital condyle is transverse and there are no lateral ones. 

The basioccipital occupies nearly a third of the length of the base of 
the cranium. 

There is a very small supraoccipital developed as a transverse bone 
above the foramen magnum and protruded forward as a triangular 
wedge between the parietals. 

External to the exoccipital there is an opisthotie element, in front of 
which succeeds a discoidal element (which is probably the prootic) with 
which alone the hyomandibular articulates, not coming in contact with 
any other otic bones. 

There are well-marked exoccipitals and alisphenoids which have more 
or less distinct sutural relations with adjoining bones, but their limits 
have not been clearly determined. 

External to the parietals there is a pterotic with lateral and ventral 
fossa' for the insertion of the strong muscles which move the jaws. 

The parasplienotd is present and extends as a narrow splint from the 
hinder portion of the basioccipital to very near the end of the rostrum, 
where it widens and assumes a slightly spatulate form, resting free on 
the ethmoid expansion, there being no vomer developed. 

The prespheiioid has not been worked as to its hunts anteriorly, but 
the tilth nerve passes out of the skull behind the alisphenoid in its usual 
relative position to other parts and immediately within and in front of 
the discoidal element lodged in a fossa behind the alisphenoid and be- 
low the pterotic, and with which the styliform hyomandibular has an 
articulation admitting of a swingiug movement, inasmuch as the pter- 
otic itself is slightly mobile in relation to the adjacent bones. 

The parietals are the best developed bones, and cover most of the 
hinder half of the cranium, those of the two sides being in contact from 
near the foramen to near the center of the roof. 

in front of the parietals there are postfrontals which form laterally 
the posterior border of the orbit. 

The ethmoid oc rostral part of the cranium is cartilaginous or like the 
chondrocraniuiii of the typical teleost in its histological characters. 

Tbe orbital fossae open obliquely forwards and directly downwards, 
and there are no infraorbital bones. 

The nasal fossce are depressed excavations in the lateral region of the. 
cranial rostrum, partly roofed over above and from behind by horizon- 
tal y projecting cartilaginous ridges; they open obliquely forwards and 
outwards within a very short distance of tin; upper side of the end of 
the snout. 

The foramen for the passage of the ninth and tenth ncrrcs opens 
alongside the basioccipital and perforates the exoccipital. 



260 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

There is no vomer developed, but a triangular cartilaginous element 
pendent from the cranial rostrum affords attachment for tin- palatine 
element anteriorly: this element is inclined obliquely downwards and 
backwards and is joined to the rostrum by its anterior border. 

The articular condyle for the suspensorium, as already indicated, is a 
discoidal cartilaginous element (resting in a fossa under the lateral ex- 
pansion of the cranium); it has a papilliform eminence in the center, 
which lits into a conical depression in the head of the slender hyoman- 
dibular bone; the hyomandibular, and especially the quadrate, are ex- 
cessively elongated and articulate by an intermediary cylindroidal car- 
tilaginous bond, which reminds one of the intervertebral disks seen in 
the spinal column of mammals; this cartilage is ensheathed behind by 
a splint like prolongation of the quadrate, which is prolonged and at- 
tenuated on the surface of the hyomandibular; the distal end of the 
quadrate is grooved longitudinally, forming, with the articular end of 
the mandible, a complete ginglymus joint. 

The vertebral are very numerous, and at the same time very simple 
and little differentiated from each other. 

The vertebral centra are annular, and constricted in the middle like 
a dice-box, and the cavity of each vertebra is filled with vacuolated 
tissue, the remains of the chorda; the centra are connected together 
by cartilaginous annular ligaments. 

The neurapophyses are slender, diverging (instead of convergent), car- 
tilaginous distally, and embracing the neural sheaths on the sides, while 
by the neurapophyses is supported a membranous sheath which roofs 
over the nervous chord, and around which there is a wide serous space 
which extends into the cranium, expanding so that the serous space 
around the brain is as capacious relatively as, or more so than, in Elas- 
mobranchs. 

Hcemapophyses are represented by parallel plates on the ventral face 
of the centra, and these plates are broadest at the ends of the vertebrae. 

The first vertebra is shorter than those which follow, and the candal 
vertebrae are simpler than those of the body and prebranchial region ; 
at the extreme tip of the tail there are possibly no vertebra? differen- 
tiated, the skeletal axis of the body being represented by the notochord 
and its sheath. 

The interspinous basalia of the median fin rays are composed of two 
pieces, one proximal, the other distal, with the articular extremities 
represented by cartilage. 

The median tin rays at their base have cartilaginous articular por- 
tions mesially divided, the halves continued distally into the lateral 
halves of the unsegmented rays. The medulla or axial portion of the 
rays is not cartilaginous. 

There is an eradiate ventral fold of ectoblast, as in embryo fishes. 
Ko dorsal or anal rays exist for some distance from the end of the tail. 
(These last are features which would indicate a defective development 
of the extreme caudal end of the bony skeletal axis of the body.) 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 267 
BRANCHIAL SYSTEM. 

The branchial apparatus has fire very short arches ami six clefts, the 
arches being fringed with a double row ot lamellae, with cartilaginous 

axial supporting filaments. The very short branchial arches seem to 
have been backwardly displaced, and the clefts open downwind instead 
of laterally. The clefts lie in a pair of anteriorly divergent furrows in 
the floor of the pharynx. The skeletal elements of the branchial ap- 
paratus are probably in large part cartilaginous and imperfectly devel- 
oped. The branchire are covered by a soft integumentary fold, in 
which there are no apparent traces of branchiosteges. 

MYOLOGY. 

The muscular apparatus which actuates the jaws and hyomandibular 
suspensor in Gastrostomits presents one very remarkable feature in that 
its cross-section apparently exceeds that of the dorso-ventral lateral 
muscular masses of the nape. These muscles operate (1) the mandible 
and (2) the hyomandibular and quadrate. 

The mandible is extended by a powerful extensor muscle, lying be- 
hind and external to the hyomandibular. (Its belly, in our largest 
specimen, is about as long as that of the hyomandibular — about .035™, 
and its filiform tendon is partially ossified, and measures .0G5 ni in 
length, thus together constituting a total length of .10 m .) Its origin 
is in the lateral cranial fossae in the pterotic, and its insertion into the 
angular portion of the mandible, which is turned upward and backward 
oxer the distal end of the quadrate, like the olecranon of man. This 
muscle may be called the extensor of the mandible, and is practically 
placed posteriorly to the suspensor. 

The other principal muscle originates anteriorly, externally and in- 
ternally to the articulation of the mandibular suspensor, which depends 
obliquely backwards from the skull, and its belly is about .05 m long 
and eight times the bulk of the mandibular extensor. Part of it 
passes down between the palatine and the suspensor internally, audits 
internal belly is prominent within the mouth, while its external belly 
is strongly marked from without, behind and below the eyes, imme- 
diately behind which its anterior origin from the skull begins. The 
dentigerous palatine is really anterior to it, but closely apposed, while 
a furrow in the posterior side of its belly receives the upper half of the 
suspensi uium. Its origin largely covers the postorbital portion of the 
ventral face of the cranium nearly as far back as the basisphenoid and 
from the external ventral margin of the skull behind the eye to near the 
middle line. Its insertion seems to be partly into the angular portion 
of the mandible in front of its articulation with the quadrate and partly 
into the quadrate itself. Its function is to close the mandible and to 
divaricate and approximate the greatly elongated suspensor. which 
itself has a cartilaginous joint near its upper third, and enjoys a special 
mobility in virtue of its peculiar articulation with the cranium.

SPLANCHNOLOGY. 

The viscera are arranged ill the abdominal cavity in a somewhat pe- 
culiar manner in that the black pigmented layer of the mouth and 
throat is continued back over a blind, saccular prolongation of the walls 
of the pharynx and oesophagus, the latter being so greatly widened as 
to scarcely be evident, except as defined by its relative position with 
respect to the brauchi*. This peculiar arrangement has given an un- 
expected significance to the generic name which we have proposed: 
While there is no very evident oesophageal constriction, Loth it and 
the pharyngeal part of the alimentary tract are very short, owing to 
the great reduction of the branchial apparatus. 

The thin membranous parietes of the mouth and throat are thrown 
into numerous longitudinal, approximated, parallel folds, in harmony 
with the fact that the throat and mouth are very distensible. This 
wrinkling of the parietes of the pharyngeal region is apparent above the 
gills, which evidently open internally in the ventral part of the pharynx. 

A darkly pigmented csecal prolongation of the throat begins just 
above and behind the gilLs, and is lined with a thick deeply plicated 
secretory epithelium, the whole sack extending as far back as the first 
half of the body cavity ; at the anterior lateral portion of this pigmented 
sack the widest, thick-walled part of the intestine arises on the right side 
and extends backward uuder the dark-walled csecal pouch along the mid 
die line between the thick and symmetrically disposed liver, which lies 
against either side of both the dark pouch and the first portion of the 
intestine, and extends for about half the length of the abdominal cavity. 
Behind the liver the intestine becomes suddenly narrower, and has two 
flexures, but is not very sharply bent upon itself. 

The pigmented ca j cai part of the alimentary tract seems to be the 
stomach, from which it is probable that the food is passed after partial 
digestion to the thick-walled anterior portion of the intestine proper, 
lying just below it and opening into it at its anterior part. 

The mode in which the food is collected is probably as suggested be- 
fore, namely, by filling the mouth with water containing small organ- 
isms which are retained and left in the pharynx above the gills as the 
water is strained through the latter. The wrinkles in the oral and 
pharyngeal integument would indicate that the latter probably contains 
scattered muscular fillers and is itself contractile. 

The abdominal cavity is separated from the cardiac by a septum, in 
front of which there is a well-developed heart of the usual type with an 
atrial sinus, ventricle, and bulbus aortas. The heart lies in a very 
thick walled pericardial sac. 

No air-bladder or rudiment of such a structure has been discovered 
in our specimens. 

The renal organs lie in the hinder part of the abdominal cavity, ex- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 2G9 

tending tor half its length as a thick agglomerated mass of nephrio 
tubules external to the peritoneum. 

Behind the liver, in the female, the ovary is developed on either side 
of the mesentery for half the length of the body cavity. It is composed 
of scries of free slightly plicated lobes which depend into the abdomi- 
nal cavity on either side of the intestine. No peritoneal tunic embraces 
the ovarian organ, and there is no oviduct, the ova escaping from the 
body by way of a conspicuous pore immediately behind the vent. 

The following facts in regard to the genesis of the ova have been 
made out: The ova probably drop from the naked ovigerons lamellae, 
as they rupture their follicles, into the abdominal cavity. In our spec- 
imen the ova were found to be immature, but were probably within a 
couple of weeks of the mature state, judging from their large size (.0007 
meter, in diameter), so that the animal probably spawns in the autumn. 
No very immature or very youug ova were noticed in the ovarian stroma, 
which would indicate that the spawning season was near at hand. (The 
specimen was obtained September 3d.) 

There is probably present in the eggs when they are full grown oil, 
which appears to be superficially embedded in the vitellus in the ova- 
rian eggs which were examined. The proof that the ova studi d by us 
were immature consists in the fact that there still seemed to be present a 
nuclear body in the center of the vitellus when the eggs were stained 
with safranin and the superfluous color abstracted with alcohol. 

What now are the deductions to be derived as to the systematic rela- 
tions of the Eurypharyngids? We cannot agree with M. Vaillant that 
they have any relations with the Anacanthini, with certain Physostomi, 
such as the Scopelidie and Stomiatidae, and also with the Apodes, nor 
that they are at all approximated to the genus Malacosteus. On the con- 
trary, in our opinion, there are few fishes more removed from them than 
the Anacanthines, and the Scopelids and Stomiatids (including Malacos- 
teus) are also extremely divergent. It is true that the latter exhibit an 
analogous extension of the oral fissure, but the little value of that char- 
acter is evident from the gradation of the wide-mouthed forms of their 
series into those having normally cleft ones. Furthermore, the exten- 
sion of the peristomal elements has been attained by entirely different 
methods in the two types. In the Scopelids and Stomiatids, the upper 
jaw is constituted by the hypertrophied intermaxillaries or supramax- 
illaries, and the palatines are conversely reduced, while in the Eurvpha- 
ryngids the upper arcade of the mouth is constituted solely by the libera- 
ted and excessively elongated palatine bones, and the maxillaries are 
entirely wanting. 

It is then with the true Apodal fishes that the Eurypharyngids may 
be most aptly compared. In that series we find a gradation from those 
forms exhibiting nearly the typical Teleostean type of structure to those 
in which the palatine bones alone form the superior arch of the mouth 



270 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

and other elements are atrophied or entirely absent. The Maraenids* 
are those forms exhibiting the greatest degree of degradation of the 
cephalic arches. But it is by no means certain yet that the Eurypharyn- 
gids are derived from the same primitive stock as the Muraenids. On 
the contrary, the evidence thus far furnished by our anatomical inves- 
tigations lead us to believe that they are the offshoots of a primitive 
phylum cognate with the specialized Apodes, but far back in the phy- 
letic history of those diversiform (or rather diversistructural) fishes. The 
common characters are rather the results of teleological modification 
resulting from analogous conditions, or rather conditions entailing 
analogous structures, than of common origin. For the present, there- 
fore, we propose to isolate the Eurypharyngids as the representatives 
of a distinct order and to place that order next to the Apodes. As an 
ordinal name we propose Lyomeri, t by which we intend to point at the 
loose counection of the palatine and suspensorial elements and the iso- 
lation of the branchial and scapular arches from the cranium. 

Whether any of the other known types of fishes belong to this order 
is very doubtful, and, in fact, we have sufficient data respecting them 
to be tolerably certain that none do, unless it may be the Saccopharynx 
flagellum. Saccopharynx is a very peculiar type, the representative of 
quite an isolated family, but its structure is almost unknown. The last 
systematic writer who has referred to its characters (Dr. Giinther) has 
described the genus as consisting of "deep-sea congers, with the mus- 
cular system very feebly developed, with the bones very thin, soft, and 
wanting in organic matter; head and gape enormous" ; "maxillary and 
mandibular^ bones very thin, slender, arched, armed with one or two 
series of long, slender, widely set teeth, their points being directed in- 
wards,'' &c.t Dr. Giinther's "maxillary" bones are doubtless palatines, 
and his description is very deficient in precision, but supplemented as 
it is by the descriptions of Mitchill and Uarwood, it is evident that the 
genus Saccopharynx. or family Saccopharynghke, is quite remote from 
the Eurypharyngidae. More than this can only be surmised at most till 
its structural characteristics are determined.' 

The question must hereafter arise whether the fishes examined by M. 
Vaillant and ourselves are the same or really distinct generic types. 
Little value is to be attached to the relative extension (within the 
limits observed) of the jaws, but the proportions of the cranium (if con- 
firmed) would indicate that the two forms exhibit marked differences, 
and our respect for the eminent French naturalist will not permit us to

propose (provisionally at least) to differentiate the two forms as follows :

Eurypharyngids with the cranium prolonged backwards, the denti- 
gerous bones little more than three times as long as the cranium;*

mandible "two hooked teeth"; t and the tail terminating in a point.

GASTROSTOMUS.

Eurypharyngids with the cranium abbreviated and little or no longer 
than broad, the dentigerous bones almost seven times as long as the 
cranium ; minute acute conic teeth depressed inwards in a very narrow 
band on the jaws (no enlarged teeth at the extremity of the mandible), 
and the tail with an eradiate membrane under its terminal portion. 

GASTROSTOMUS BAIRDII. 

Gastrostomus bairdii Gill & Ryder. 

The cranium forms about one-thirtieth or less of the extreme length, 
and is as broad as long; the jaws are excessively elongated, being nearly 
(in large) or more (in young) than seven times longer than the cranium; 
there are about 160 rays in the dorsal fin and about 107 in the anal; the 
pectorals are very small, being only about as long as the diameter of 
the eye, and little more than twice as long as wide at the base, and 
have about nine simple rays. The rays of the unpaired fins are quite 
flexible in the small individuals, but quite rigid and more perfectly 
ossified in the larger; they become obsolete toward the end of the tail. 
The rays, which are rigid and well ossified anteriorly, become shorter, 

* "This animal, about 0.47 metre long and 0.02 metre high at the most elevated 
part, is of an intense deep black color. The body, the form of which is masked in 
front by the abnormal mouth, which •will be mentioned further on, resembles that of 
Macmrus; it becomes regularly attenuated from about the anterior fourth, the point 
at which the external branchial orifice is seen, and terminates iu a point at the caudal 
extremity ; the anus is situated at the junction of the anterior third •with the posterior 
two-thirds of the body. 

••What gives this fish a very peculiar physiognomy is tho arrangement of the jaws 
and the structure of the mouth, which are even an exaggeration of what Mr. Ayres 
has described in Malacosteus niger. Although the head is short, scarcely 0.03 metre, 
the jaws and the susptnsorium are excessively elongated ; the latter did not measure less 
than 0.095 metre ; and from this it results that the articular angle is carried very far 
back, to a distance from the end of the muzzle equal to aoout three and a half times the 
length of the cephalic portion."

mandible there are two hooked teeth 0.002 metre long."

ORNITHOLOGICAL NOTES ON COLLECTIONS MADE IN JAPAN FROM 
JUNE TO DECEMBER, 1883. 

By PIERRE LOUIS JOUY. 

INTRODUCTION. 

Accompanied by Mr. A. J. M. Smith, I left Yokohama on the morn- 
ing of the 23d of June, 1882, for an ornithological trip to Fujiyama. 
This, the highest mountain iu Japan, is a favorite breeding-ground for 
many species of birds, both migratory and resident ; centrally situated 
and having an altitude of over 12,000 feet above the sea level, it affords 
every favorable condition of environment. 

Traveling by the ordinary hand-carriage, or kuruma, we accomplished 
about 35 miles of our journey, which was as far as the condition of the 
roads would allow. We then walked on to Tonozawa, a small place 
where we had a bath heated by a natural spring, and also secured very 
good accommodations for the night. 

From Tonozawa to Ashinoyu, by mountain paths, through several 
small villages, occupied the next day. Sulphur springs of varying tem- 
perature, from 85° Fah. to boiling point, abound in these hills, and are 
utilized largely for bathing purposes. The water is conducted by means 
of bamboo pipes to the houses and public bathing places, and in many 
of the towns hot and cold water flow side by side through the principal 
street. 

Here, as in Switzerland, the people are mainly engaged in cabinet 
work, turning and carving; many grotesque objects are made out of the 
roots of trees. Although mills run by water-power abound, yet they

do not use water for driving the lathes, which have only a half lotiry 
motion and are worked entirely by foot-power. 

The weather was very unpropitious, and the roads were in a very bad 
condition. It still continuing to rain heavily, we stopped at Ashinoyu 
for two days. Few birds were seen, except Passer montanus, Emberiza 
ciopsis, and the sprightly Japanese nightingale, Cettia, which, despite 
the rain, sang merrily on every roadside. 

From Ashinoyu, over the grass bills skirting Hakone Lake, we walked 
on to Higashitanaka, a small town about 6 miles from our destination, 
where, procuring a kuruuia, we arrived at Subashiri on the same day. 
Subashiri, situated on the east slope of Fuji, 2,500 feet above the level 
of the sea, is almost due west from Yokohama about 45 miles. It is 
one of the principal towns from which the pilgrims make the ascent of 
the Sacred Mountain. Though small it consists mainly of " tea-houses," 
or native hotels, and can probably accommodate GOO or 800 guests. 
Arriving three or four weeks ahead of the pilgrim season, we found the 
place quite deserted, and were fortunate in securing two very good 
rooms at the best tea-house in the place. Here we worked from the 
28th of June until the end of July, and, although we had ten days of 
bad weather, we succeeded in getting 326 specimens and about 60 
species of birds, besides a few nests and eggs. A number of interest- 
ing tirst plumages of birds were obtained which have hitherto been 
undescribed. The approach of the pilgrim season filled, the town with 
guests, whose curiosity in regard to our doings became a positive an- 
noyance. From the middle of July until the end of August an average 
of over 1,000 persons ascended the mountain daily from the various 
towns around its base. A large proportion of these people passed 
through Subashiri. 

Having accomplished all that it was possible for us to do unless we 
had waited for the fall migration, we determined to seek a new field. 
Returning to Yokohama for fresh supplies, we resolved to continue our 
work in the central part of Japan. We accordingly left on the 22d of 
August, taking a tent and outfit for an extended trip in the mountains. 
We first camped out on the shores of Chiusenji Lake, among the Nikko 
Mountains, about 90 miles nearly due north from Yokohama. 

At this elevated region (4,375 feet above the level of the sea), although 
early in September, the nights were quite cold, and very few birds were 
to be obtained. A fine specimen of the honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) 
was brought to us by an old native hunter, who shot it with his match- 
lock gun; the young of the rare robin (Larvivora cyanea), also the young 
of the Eastern bullfinch (Pyrrhula orientalis), were the most interesting 
birds we collected at Chiusenji. 

An occasional kite was seen flying over the lake, refuting the testi- 
mony of the guide-book, which states that u ?wfish live in it." Swifts, 
which are so numerous in summer, had all departed when we arrived, 
and a sojourn of ten days at the lake convinced us that we had arrived 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 275 

at that unsatisfactory season when the migratory birds had all departed, 
and yet it was not cold enough to drive the winter birds down from the 
mountains. 

Finding it necessary to reduce our luggage to the smallest amount 
possible with the work in hand, we sent our tent and collections on 
hand back to Yokohama. The balance of our supplies and outfit we 
sent by native express company to Omachi, in the province of Shinshiu, 
which we decided to make our headquarters. We now had a walk 
before us of about 100 miles over some of the most picturesque and 
mountainous country in Japan, extending nearly across the main island. 
The roads were exceedingly rough, being mainly bridle-paths for pack- 
horses. In this stretch of country we did not observe a single valley 
10 miles in width. Five miles from Chiusenji we passed through the 
town of Umoto, on the shores of Umoto Lake, a beautiful sheet of water, 
smaller in t-ize than Chiusenji, but much more irregular in shape. This 
lake is on a higher level than Chiusenji, and empties into it by a steep 
cascade. Some of the strongest sulphur springs in Japan are found at 
Umoto, and are much resorted to by travelers. The water, which is 
124° Fahr., pours out of the hillside and finally empties into the lake, 
turning the water a dirty, milky color. In this part of the lake we 
noticed that carp were particularly abundant, seeming to enjoy the 
warmer water. 

At Xumata, a town of about 4,000 inhabitants, we secured specimens 
of the "At," a celebrated Japanese fish belonging to the Salinonida 1 (the 
Salmo altivelis of authors). These fish are caught in a peculiar man- 
ner. After whipping the stream with flies, as for trout, and securing a 
fish, a fine gut line is passed through the nostrils and fastened to a line 
held in the hand; trailing behind the fish thus fastened, which is simply 
a decoy, are several bright hooks which flash in the sunlight and attract 
other fish. The decoy is now gently led up stream, and the fish, in dart- 
ing after it, get snagged on the hooks. Horse-hoof parings, used as 
lures, are said to be successful with "Ai v ; they are also caught with 
weirs. 

At Kusats, one of the most important watering-places in Japan, cele- 
brated for its many fine baths, we stopped for a day and a half. Here 
bathing is done under systematic instruction, and many people suifer- 
ingfrom skin-diseases resort to the springs during the summer months. 

The red-cheeked starlet (Sturnia pyrrhogenys), which we had observed 
only once before at Subashiri, was very common about Kusats; several 
flocks of 30 or 40 were seen. 

The only town of any importance in our line of travel was Zenkoji, 
the capital of the province of Shinshiu, where we arrived on the evening 
of the 10th of September. This is quite a large, compactly built place, 
containing about 7,000 people. On the high road to Niigata, the west 
coast seaport, it commands most of the trade of this section of the 
country. 



276 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

We spent a day here visiting the famous temples and sightseeing. 

We left Zenkoji on the morning of the 18th, and, having secured a 
kuruma for a short distance, we walked the remainder, 25 miles, into 
Omachi, where we arrived at 5 p. m. 

Omachi, situated at the base of the Tate-Yama Mountains, is 2,150 
feet above the sea-level and about 130 miles northwest from Yokohama. 
These mountains, the most considerable in Japan, present an almost 
impassable barrier between the province of Skinshiu and the west 
coast, a pass 7,700 feet high, affording a doubtful means of communi- 
cation during a lew months in the year. We were attracted to this 
isolated region by the accounts of the game which was said to abound 
in the mountains. We were also anxious to secure ptarmigan, said to 
be exceedingly tame and abundant. 

As our luggage had not yet arrived, we were detained at Omachi 
several days awaiting it; meanwhile we occupied ourselves in pros- 
pecting about the country in search of a permanent place to work in. 
At Oide, a small hunting village 3 miles from Omachi, containing a 
single tea-house, we secured a room, and our gear having arrived we 
took possession of our quarters and commenced work on the 25th of 
September. Here we remained for three months, adding many valuable 
specimens to our previous collections, and returning to Yokohama late 
in December. 

At Tate-Yama we secured specimens of the rare goat-antelope Nemor- 
heduH crispar, the Japanese bear, Ursusjaponicas, the monkey, Macacm 
speciosus, raccoon-faced dog, badger, and many smaller animals of equal 
rarity. Our collection of birds was enhanced by about 300 skins, in- 
cluding many species not collected by us before. We also made a small 
collection of fishes and reptiles. 

Before closing this brief account I desire to acknowledge my indebted- 
ness to Mr. Alan Owston, of Yokohama, whose co-operation in my work 
and many acts of kindness made collecting possible ; to Gapt. Thomas 
Blakiston, for invaluable assistance in the work of identification ; to 
Mr. Smith, a genial companion and excellent collector, who performed 
the office of interpreter and smoothed over the roughness of traveling 
in a strange country ; to Mr. n. Pryer, who gave me free access to a 
valuable collection of Japanese birds ; and to many other gentlemen 
for courtesies extended.

not meet with it at any other place. The nest is generally placed in 
the fork of a small tree overhanging a stream, and is composed of moss 
and roots woven iuto a compact mass, with the addition of dried leaves 
and mud to give it solidity. It is lined with grass, fine rootlets, and 
horse- hair. It is about 120 Ium to 130 mm in diameter, and its inside depth 
is from 40 mm to 45 mm . The eggs vary much in size and color, ranging 
from 27 ,um to 29£ mm in length, aud from 20 mm to 21£ mm in diameter. 

The ground color is a rich creamy tint with faint lilaceous blotches ; 
the eggs are mottled all over with streaks and blotches of madder- 
brown. 

Nests were taken in the latter part of June and early in July. 

Young in first plumage. — Above, uniform dusky ; the feathers of the

This species seems to be rather a rare one. We collected it only in 
Shinshiu in autumn. 

It is generally found in thickets and about streams, but a few were 
taken on the hills by the bird-catchers.

This tine thrash frequents the deeper woods, and is rarely seen below 
a considerable altitude. I once shot one as he flitted across the path, 
but most of the specimens were collected at a small spring which flowed 
from the side of Fuji, at an elevation of about 5,000 feet. They were 
very shy, and only seen about sunset. Tbis spring, the only water for 
a considerable distance around, was a favorite resort for all kinds of 
small birds, whicb, towards sunset, began to appear in twos and threes 
from all directions. 

Robins and flycatchers, ?iarcissina, and others, were frequently seen; 
among flocks of tits noisily fighting for first place at the bath, the little 
Acredula seemed the most aggressive. The Siberian thrush was so 
silent in its movements and suspicious of the slightest noise that it re- 
quired the closest attention to detect it. This spot became one of our 
favorite collecting grounds. 

A full-plumaged male which had begun to assume the autumnal plum- 
age was taken at Chiusenji Lake in the latter part of August. The 
primary coverts are edged with brownish; the superciliary line is not 
so distinct, and is slightly suffused with brownish. All the feathers of 
the crown have rusty edgings, and there are traces of the same color 
ou the throat. The belly is considerably lighter than the breast, and 
there are a number of black terminal spots to the feathers.

Turdus chrysolaus T. Temm. et Scbl., Faun. Japon, 1847, Ares, pi. xxviii, p. 64; 
Whitely, Ibis, 1867, p. 199; Blakiston and Pryer, Ibis, 1878, p. 241; Blakiaton 
and Pryer, Trans. As. Soc. Japan, Vol. X, Pt. I, p. 165; Brit. Mus. Cat., Vol. 
V, p. 275. 

This thrush is quite common at Fuji in the breeding season, and was 
also found at Chiusenji Lake and at Tate-Yama. Some specimens in 
breeding- plumage show a distinct white line over the eye entirely want- 
ing in fall birds, which are also very dark on the throat and ear coverts. 

The nest is similar in size and general appearance to that of card-is, 
but is composed of much coarser material, and instead of being covered 
with moss it is bound together with long fibers of grass. One nest has 
a piece of straw rope and a bit of old blue cotton cloth in it, such as 
used by the natives in making sandals or "warajies." 

The eggs are pale bluish in color, blotched and speckled all over with 
brown and lilaceous. They average slightly smaller in size than cardis, 
being about 27 mm by 20 mm . 

Young birds iu first plumage resemble young of cardis, but are much 
lighter in color. The back is light olive brown; all the feathers have 
broad ochraceous webs,. giving the back a streaked appearance; the 
feathers are also margined with blackish; the head is slightly darker 
than the back. 

The cheeks and under parts are suffused with ochraceous, which 
deepens into reddish brown on the flanks. Tbe sides of the head, 
breast, and flanks are thickly covered with small dusky spots.

"Screechers" are exceedingly abundant in every locality in which I 
have collected. 

They are very gifted vocalists, and have a wide range of mimicking 
notes, reminding one at times of our own mocking thrushes. They have 
no notes so sweet as our thrushes, and their vocabulary is varied with 
the voice of the purple grackle and the discordant notes of the jay. 

They are caught in large numbers in Shinshiu in a very peculiar 
manner. Decoys, of their own species, are placed in cages in a grove 
of trees, generally on top of a hill, and about 15 or 20 feet apart; close 
by is a horizontal twig, birdlimed, on the end of which is a bunch of at- 
tractive berries. A few inches below the twig a net is spread, about 10 
inches wide at the top, and 18 inches deep. The birds, attracted by the 
calls of their mates in the cages, and the seductive berries, alight on 
the twigs, and, feeling the lime, attempt to throw themselves off by drop- 
ping down backwards, and generally fall in the net. If they fall on 
the ground, they have so much birdlime on them that they are easily 
caught. 

In the autumn these birds fly in large flocks, and as many as thirty 
or forty are caught in a morning by one man.

Common in the long grass of the hillsides around Fuji. Breeding in 
June ; fully fledged young taken early in July. These birds are often 
seen on the tops of the grass stems or small bushes, and utter a sharp 
clicking note when approached. Although not shy, they are very wary, 
and rapidly make their way through the thick grass, appearing and dis- 
appearing on all sides. 

Young in first plumage are much streaked and spotted above with dusky 
and pale buff. All the feathers of the crown and nape with narrow buffy 
webbings. Back with arrow-shaped buff centers to the tips of the feathers ; 
upper tail coverts brownish. Wings and tail dusky, the latter tipped 
and edged with brownish. Secondaries and wing coverts broadly edged 
with brownish; innermost wing coverts white. Chin, breast, and belly 
pale buff; throat dirty white. The feathers of the breast much edged 
and mottled with dusky.

Specimens of this rare robin were collected both at Fuji and Chiu- 
seuji. At the latter locality we obtained two specimens of the young of 
the year. They are dull olive ou the crown and back; rump and tail 
blue; wings dusky bluish or brownish. Eyelids and line from the bill to 
the eye ochraceous. Breast and sides of the face ochraceous. All the 
feathers with faint olivaceous edgings. The throat is lighter than the 
breast, and separated from it by these olivaceous edgings to the feathers.

This is one of the commonest birds in the mountains during summer. 

It is very familiar in its ways and easily approached. Seated on a 
low branch of a tree or shrub, with its head on one side, it eyes you 
curiously, all the while uttering a low, guttural, chuckling note. 

This bird is often the only one seen on some of the higher passes. 

Young of the year resemble the female.

We found the dipper common in all the mountain streams, but it was 
more abundant in Shinshiu than at Fuji. 

Young birds are curiously mottled all over, the under parts with 
white, dusky, and brownish markings. The throat is lighter in color 
than the breast, and is the last to assume the adult plumage. 

The back is a light chocolate browu, all the feathers being margined 
with dusky. 

The white spot over the eye is particularly noticeable in the young.

Young of the year resemble the adult, but have the crown dusky, and 
lack the central stripe. The figure in the Fauna Japonica is lacking in 
the median line on the crown.

Abundant everywhere, breeding at Fuji. In summer their cheerful 
and pleasing song enlivens every roadside. 

Young birds, and adults also in autumn and winter, are very wren- 
like in their habits, being found along the banks of streams and in brush- 
heaps. They utter a harsh scolding note when disturbed, and have the 
same habit of cocking the tail over the back. Young in first plumage, 
above dull olive, head slightly grayish; wings and tail brownish; line 
over the eye yellow. Entire under parts pale yellowish. Sides and 
flanks slightly olivaceous; tarsi and toes dusky.

Cettia cantillans (T. & S.). Teinm. et Schl., Faun. Japon., 1847, Aves, pi. xx, p. 52; 
Blakiston, Ibis, 1862, p. 318; Whitely, Ibis, 1867, p. 197. 

A large series of specimens collected at Fuji and elsewhere, together 
with two forms of young birds, induce me to reinstate the name of can- 
tillans, ignored of late by ornithologists, for the smaller species. I do 
not distinguish any difference of color, but there is a very great differ- 
ence in size, especially in the comparative leugth of the wing and tarsus. 
ft cantans measures: tarsus, 24.5 mm to 25.5 m,n , and wing 63 mm to 65 mn ', 
while cantillans is 22 mm to 22.5 mm in the tarsus, and wing 55 mm . 

This difference in size cannot be attributable to sex or season. I 
have a female of cantans measuring 9.5 mm more in the wing than adult 
male of cantillans. There is a marked difference in the young -of the 
two species, cantans. young, being 25 mm , cantillans 22 imu , in the tarsus; 
and 56 """ against 50 mtn in the wing. 

Young in first plumage are the same as described under cantans, but 
have the tarsi and toes vellowish instead of dusky.

This bird was taken on Fuji- Yama at an altitude of about 7,000 feet. 
It undoubtedly breeds there. It was first seen about Tate- Yama early 
in October, having been forced down from the mountains by the snow- 
storms.

The commonest tit, abundant everywhere in the mountains, asso- 
ciating with the coal and marsh tits. 

Found breeding at Fuji in June. A nest which contained seven young 
birds was taken from an old bamboo pipe which stood in the yard of 
our inn at Subashiri. 

Young birds in the first plumage differ from the adults in having the 
entire upper parts, with the exception of the white spot in the nape of 
the neck, dull olive green; crown slightly darker. Sides of the face, 
breast, and flanks pale yellowish. Throat and middle of the belly like 
the back. The cheek patches are not separated from the color of the 
breast, as in the adult.

This bird, commonly seen in cages all over the country, was rather 
rare at Fuji, and was only seen late in the season at Tate- Yama. 

It is found in the pines with other species of tits, but is generally soli- 
tary or in pairs. Its note resembles that of the little woodpecker.

Common in the summer near the peaks of the high mountains; breed-

Found about brush-heaps and near streams in the lowlands from 
about the middle of November. 

I could not distinguish any difference between the habits of this bird 
and our own familiar winter wren. It has the same low, delicious, 
warbling song common to both species.

Very common in the meadows around Fuji. They are rather shy in 
their habits, the males mounting the tops of the long grass and disap- 
pearing on the other side. I did not succeed in getting any females, and 
judge that they were all in the nests at that time.

Very common at Fuji-Yama, where it was breeding in July. We had 
a nest of this bird brought to us which contained three eggs. They are 
plain bluish white in color, without speckling, and measure about 13.5 mm 
by 17 mm . The nest is a beautiful structure, composed entirely of moss

patched outside with large pieces of licheu and lined inside with horse- 
hair. It is rather flat in shape and is evidently a ground nest. It 
measures about 90 a,m outside diameter and is IC 1111 in depth; inside 
diameter, 55 mm . This bird was common in Shinshiu in the autumn and 
was often taken by the bird-catchers.

Exceedingly abundant at Fuji ; found as high up as the snow line. 

Breeding in the latter part of June and early in July. Nest on the 
ground, composed of moss and dried grass, very slightly lined with finer 
grasses and rootlets. The eggs vary much in size and shape, ranging 
from 19 mm to 21 mm in length, and average 10 mm in breadth. The ground 
color is lilaceous; the entire surface is speckled all over with sepia, the 
spots becoming confluent on the larger end. 

Young of the year resemble the adult, but are duller on tbe upper 
parts and all the markings are finer. Wing coverts with buffy edgings; 
flanks and under tail coverts washed with ochraceous.

These birds are familiar objects flying through the streets and darting 
into the native houses through open doors. Almost every house in a 
Japanese town has one or more little wooden shelves, placed just inside 
the door on one of the rafters of the ceiling, on which the swallows 
build their nests and rear their young. Nor is their confidence mis- 
placed ; they are as sacred on their shelf as any of the household gods, 
an oiler of money for which is considered an insult. I believe these 
swallows rarely build elsewhere than in the situations I have described.

We found these birds breeding in considerable numbers on the sides of 
an inaccessible cliff or chasm on Fuji-Yama above the limit of forest 
growth. Their nests must have been composed largely of saliva, as 
there is no mud in that volcanic region. Many of the birds, when 
shot, had their mouths full of fine seorirc dust, of which they were 
evidently making their nests.

We saw these birds on some of the higher passes in Shinshiu in 
September.

I did not observe this bird at Fuji. In the latter part of November 
a small flock made its appearance at Tate-Yama. They were feeding, 
at that time, on mistletoe berries.

Very abundant at tbe base of Fuji, breeding'. Xot observed else- 
where. 

Nest in the fork of a small tree or busb. It is very large for the 
size of the bird, measuring 100""" in diameter, with an inside depth of 
50 mm . It is composed of roots, the stems of plants, and grass, and is 
lined with finer grasses and rootlets. The eggs are cream color, much 
speckled all over, but especially the larger end, with umber brown; 
there are a few lilac blotches beneath the spots. The eggs are per- 
fectly oval iu shape, and measure 22 mm by lG.5 mm . 

Young, first plumage. — Above, grayish brown, tinged with rusty, 
and narrowly barred with dusky; these bars narrower and more indis- 
tinct on nape; rump dull buff, narrowly and rather distantly barred; 
upper tail coverts light rusty, narrowly barred with dusky; wings 
dusky, the coverts and secondaries broadly margined with pale rusty; 
lores and auriculars blackish, bordered above by light mottled grayish; 
lower parts white, the breast and sides tinged with pale burly grayish, 
and rather indistinctly undulated with dark grayish; bill pale-colored, 
darker on culmen ; feet very pale.

f Lanius magnirostri3 Less. Blakiston and Pryer, Trans. As. Soc. Japan, Vol. X, 
Pt. I, 1832, p. 147. 

A specimen which is identical with the one mentioned in Blakiston 
and Pryer's list was shot at Fuji. It has the form of superciliosus, but 
is a very distinct species. 

The head is pure ashy gray, extending down to the shoulders; the 
wing-coverts, back, and rump are a rich chestnut, closely barred with 
dusky wavy lines. Ear coverts black. A narrow black line extends 
from the eye to the base of the bill. Nasal feathers white. A super- 
ciliary and post-ocular white line. Entire under parts pure white ; flanks 
barred with dusky. Tail chestnut, narrowly tipped with white. Bill 
heavy, strongly hooked and toothed, 15 mm in length. Wing 92 mm . Tail 
85" ,m . Tarsus 24 mm .

Pyrrhula orientalis T. &■ S. Teinni. et Schl., Faun. Japon., 1847, Aves, pi. liii, p. 
91; Blakistou, Ibis, 1862, p. 328; Whitely, Ibis, 1867, p. 203; Swinboe, Ibis, 
1874, p. 160; Blakiston and Pryer, Trans. As. Soc. Japan, Vol. X, Pt. I, 1882, 
p. 176 ; Seebobm, Ibis, 1882, p. 371, as rosacea. 

I first saw these birds high up Fuji, at an elevation of between 3,000 
and 4,000 feet. Young birds were very common in the treetops at 
Chiusenji Lake in latter part of August, seeming to keep entirely in the 
birch trees. 

A large series of specimens in various stages of plumage, collected in 
Shinshiu, induce me to believe that Seebohm's species rosacea is simply 
a highly -developed stage of plumage of orientalis. 

Looking over the collection I find I have five adult males. The first 
is typical orientalis; cheek-patches and throat rose color, breast clear 
ashy gray, back slightly darker. In the second the color of the throat 
is not clearly defined against the gray breast, the rose color runs down 
to a point in front, and there are rosy feathers scattered over the breast; 
in the third the rose has become a decided tint all over the breast, and 
in the fourth this color is still deeper on the breast, and has made its ap- 
pearance on the back ; but in the fifth speci men the rosaceous phase is very 
well developed. There is no line of demarkation between the cheeks 
and the breast. The rose color, or "vermillion," as Seebohm calls it, 
extends all over the breast, down to the flanks. The back is also strongly 
suffused with the same color. I judge that this specimen is even brighter 
or more rosaceous than the ones Mr. Seebohm describes, but with such a 
series before me as I have just described, I must draw the conclusion 
that rosacea is simply a phase of plumage of orientalis. Captain Blak- 
iston agrees with me in the conclusions arrived at in regard to this 
species. 

This phase of plumage is by no means rare in Shinshiu. A fair propor- 
tion of all the males I saw had the flush of breast and back of rosacea. 
Both plumages are figured in the "Fauna Japoniea." 

Young birds of the year : upper parts dirty olive-brown, darker on 
the head, rump white ; below brownish, lighter in tint than the back. 
Wings and tail as in the adult. Bill smoky brown; feet brownish. The 
chin is black in some specimens.

One specimen of this bird was obtained in Shinshiu having been 
caught with bird-lime. 

This species appears to have been only recorded in a wild state before 
from Yezo. I am informed, however, that the bird-dealers of Tokio fre- 
quently have specimens of this bird for sale. Locality of specimens un-

This bird is frequently found in the bird-shops in winter, but is rarely 
seen in a state of nature on account of the shyness of its habits. Wo 
did not meet with it at Fuji-Yama.

Crossbills were exceedingly plentiful in Shinshiu from about the 
middle of October. We were informed by the natives that they made 
their appearance in considerable numbers about every third year. At 
such times many people are employed catching them, and a consider- 
able number are destroyed. The site for a bird-catcher of this descrip- 
tion is on the summit of a hill, where there are a few trees, generally 
firs or pines. Selecting a suitable tree in vt hich to hang his cages of 
decoy birds, he proceeds to make a broom-like arrangement of fir branches 
by wrapping them on the end of a long pole ; into this he thrusts a few 
slender twigs, which have been coated with bird-lime. Resting the 
pole against the tree, and allowing the limed twigs to project through 
the top, he lies in wait at a suitable distance off, quietly smoking his 
pipe, until some passing flocks of siskins or crossbills are attracted by 
the singing of the birds in the cages and alight on the twigs. Taking 
the old twigs out, with the birds fluttering and struggling on them, 'he 
puts new ones in their places and is ready for the next flock. 

Some specimeus, males, are curiously mottled with red, green, and 
orange, and some females have a decided reddish tinge to the feathers.

I did not see these birds alive, either in the mountains or elsewhere, 
in Japan, but on returning from Tate Yaina, late in December, there 
were immense strings of them in the bird-shops uear Matsninoto. In 
two small shops there were at least three hundred specimens, all more 
or less decomposed. I managed to secure a few for identification. We 
were informed that they had all been netted, and most of them had been 
taken at one time. 

These birds compare very well with Yezo specimens taken in Feb- 
ruary. Kurile Island birds (summer) are much darker, and have black 
bills.

Two specimens of this bird, apparently not taken before south of 
Yezo, were obtained from a bird-catcher at Tate-Yama. They had 
been caught with bird-lime and were in company with siskins.

Abundant everywhere near houses or towns, finding suitable breed- 
ing-localities in the thatched roofs of the native houses. This bird is 
much prized by the Japanese as a subject for screen-pictures and other 
ornamental purposes, and is one of the few birds that they draw pre- 
eminently well. 

It seems to have rather a gentler disposition than its much despised 
relative, domesticus. 

Note. — I did not meet with P. rutilana either at Fuji or in Shinshiu.

This bird was obtained on Fuji-Yama in July at an elevation of about 
8,000 feet. It was generally found in the scrub willows and has a spar- 
row-like chirping note. Later in the season we obtained it at a much 
lower elevation in Shinshiu. 

It does not seem to be a common bird ; not more than one or two speci- 
mens are ever seen at a time.

Two specimens of this bird were obtained from Fuji. They had been 
prepared by natives, and were so moth-eaten that they had to be de- 
stroyed. I identified them as belonging to this species. One specimen 
was subsequently obtained in Shinshiu. It was shot on the summit of

Mt. Gorokudake in the Tate-Tama Range. The Japanese happily call 
this bird the u iica hibari," "rock lark," a name which is very suggestive 
of the habits of the bird. 

Returning from Tate Yama late in December by way of Usui Pass, I 
had the pleasure of seeing three of these birds at the same time, cer- 
tainly an unusual thing for birds of their solitary nature. I was descend- 
ing the pass considerably in advance of my companions, when a turn in 
the road brought me by a partially boggy place, surrounded by rocks 
with water trickling over and between them. Here I saw the accentors. 
They were flitting around on the rocks, and seemed to be rather silent 
birds, simply uttering a low, soft chuckling note. They were very fa- 
miliar, and allowed me to approach within about 20 feet without taking 

alarm.

We found the nut crackers on Fuji at an elevation of about 5,000 feet. 
They were in small flocks of eight or ten and were quite easily ap- 
proached, having none of the sagacity of crows or jays. Tbe natives 
give them the name "balca-lcarasuj 7 or 'fool-crows,' on that account. 

They are occasionally seen on the foot-hills at Tate-Yama in December, 
and are sometimes trapped.

Abundant everywhere in small flocks. Collected at Fuji, Chiusenji 

Lake, and in Shinshiu. Young of the year differ from adults in having 

the upper parts, crown, back, and wing-coverts dull rufous. The ear 

coverts are of the same color, thus showing a near affinity to glandarius. 

It is also worthy of notice that the iris of young birds is light blue, as 

in glandarius.

Pt. I. 1882, p. 148: Brit. Mus. Cat., Vol. IV, p. 361. 

Very abundant around Fuji in summer, breeding from the latter part 
of June until tbe middle of July. 

The flight of tbis bird is heavy and only sustained for sbort distances. 
It has none of the quick, nervous movements of the fly-catchers, but 
when flitting silently from tree to tree, or throwing itself headlong from 
some tall branch and catching an insect in its flight and alighting again 
with one long curve, it resembles a heavy-headed dart. The long tail, 
three times the length of the body, quite overbalances the bird aud gives 
it this peculiar appearance when flying. 

The nest is placed in the deep fork of a small tree, sometimes sup- 
ported by the swaying branches of a Wisteria, and about 8 or 10 feet 
from the ground ; generally near running water. It is composed of 
dried grass, strips of bark, and live moss, which is bound around the 
forks of the tree and trails down in some examples for a considerable 
distance below the nest. 

Some nests are garnished with pieces of lichen and the whole outside 
surface is bound together aud smoothed off with spider webs. 

The nest is lined inside with fine moss roots. The eggs are rounded 
oval in shape and measure 20 mm by 16 mm . The ground tint is a delicate 
pinkish or cream color, and they are much speckled on the side and 
around the butt with lilac blotches and spots of burnt sienna. 

The males do not attain the adult plumage until the third year ; young 
males of the second year resemble the female, but are much darker and 
have longer tails. The colors of the soft parts of this bird are much 
more brilliant in life than they are represented in the ' Fauna Japonica' 
plate, aud the fleshy ring around the eye is larger. They are as follows : 
Iris blue-black; eyelids and bill bright cobalt blue; tarsi and toes 
bluish lead color.

This bird is occasionally seen at Fuji, in small flocks, in the tree-tops. 
I observed it also, under similar conditions, at Chiusenji Lake. It has 
a loud, whistling note. 

A young male, collected in the latter part of August, is in the plum- 
age of the female, but differs in having the three innermost secondaries 
broadly edged with white.

Common in the deep woods at Fuji, breeding early in June. Ocean 
sionally seen at Chiuseuji in September. 

This bird is easily attracted by imitating its mellow whistling note. 

Young in first plumage; entire upper parts dull olive brownish; all 
the feathers edged with dusky, and with large ochraceous centers, thus 
giving the bird a very streaked and spotted appearance. Wing dusky 
brownish or bluish (in males); shoulder and greater wing-coverts broadly 
edged with ochraceous. 

Under parts strongly suffused with ochraceous ; all the feathers edged 
with dusky. 

Bill brownish; mouth and base of under mandible yellow; tarsi and 
toes dusky yellowish ; claws dusky. *

This is the commonest woodpecker in the mountains. 

Specimens vary considerably in the amount of white in the wings 
and in the markings of the tail feathers. In one example the barring 
of the tail is almost obsolete, and in most of our specimens only the 
two centra' tail feathers are entirely black. This peculiarity has been 
remarked on before, but in a large series of specimens from Shinshiu 



308 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

this is the rule, only two specimens in the lot having the four central 
feathers black.

This bird was not common at Fuji, but became tolerably so in Shin- 
shiu in autumn and winter. 

It almost invariably accompanies flocks of tits, associating witli them 
in perfect harmony. 

On moving from tree to tree they utter tbe warning cry "gee'd," 
"gedd," but whether the tits follow the woodpecker, or vice versa, I was 
unable to ascertain with certainty.

We did not succeed in getting any Cuckoos at Fuji, although we 
frequently heard the notes of several species. They are so constantly 
hunted by the natives for medicinal purposes that it is impossible to 
approach them in the breeding season. At Chiusenji we occasionally 
saw them flitting silently through the trees along the lake shore.

We only met with this bird at Chiusenji Lake, where we shot a single 
specimen. We were told by the natives that they were common at the 
lake during the summer months. 

Xote. — We saw the large black and white kingfisher, Geryle guttata, 
at Tate-Tama up to the time we left, the latter part of December, and 
were told that they remained all winter. It is found in the wildest 
mountain streams and gorges, and is exceedingly wary. We did uot 
succeed in getting specimens.

Abundant at Fuji, where their cry, "chuck, dine!:, clinch? was con- 
stantly heard in the still evening air, and sometimes before daybreak in 
the morning. We frequently saw them Hying around the lake shore at 
Chiusenji, and observed them occasionally in Shinshiu up to the end of 
October. At this time they are silent, and are only obtained by dis- 
turbing them in their resting places in the daytime.

Two specimens of this bird were obtained in Shinshiu. They had 
been caught in nets. 

This is the only species of owl that we succeeded in collecting. Con- 
sidering the nature of the country we were in, the variety of owls was 
indeed remarkable. 

In the deep woods above Chiuseuji Lake 1 saw a very light colored 
specimen of Symium rvfe.scens. I was attracted by the noisy chattering 
of a flock of jays, and on approaching saw a large owl sitting on a 
burnt stump. In the gloom of the forest I at first took it to be a snowy 
owl. The jays were flying around him, screeching and jawing in noisy 
excitement, and every now and then one would fly at him. I was un- 
able to approach near enough to get a shot on account of the denseness 
of the underbrush. While I stood watching this bloodless battle he 
quietly flew off with his tormentors following him.

We saw this bird circling around mountain peaks, on two occasions 
during our stay at the lake, and were informed by the natives that they 
were common every year in the mountains about Nikko and Chiuseuji. 
I am not sure that this information is reliable, however, because they 
confound this species with Spizaetus nlpalensis and call them both

This is tbe commonest species of hawk in Shiushiu. A fine series, 
comprising male, female, and young, were obtained in October and 
November. At this season, when they are migrating, large numbers 
are taken by the natives in nets and also with bird-lime. 

They are very plucky in the pursuit of game, often attacking birds 
almost as large and strong as themselves. On such occasions they pay 
little heed to an observer. I have seen one of these birds in hot pur- 
suit of a large woodpecker (P. japonicus), which only escaped through 
the friendly shelter of a large pine. The average measurement of the 
wing in nine adult males is 168 ,nm (102 mm to 173 mui ), and the tarsus 48 mm 
(46 mm to 49 mm ). 

Young males average in the wing lGG mni (lGl ram to 171 mm ), and tarsus 

4gmm (^.gniiu {-q ^.f)mm\ 

The adult female measures 193 mm in the wing, and 52 mm in the tarsus. 

Young females average in the wing 189 mm (184 l " m to 194"""), and 
tarsus SO™ 11 (50 mm to 52"""). 

Noue of this series of male adults are as bright on the flanks as the 
example figured in the " Fauna Japonica."

We found this beautiful pigeon tolerably abundant at Fuji, but ex-

cherries. We observed them in Shinshiu as late as October 20. They 
are sometimes caught in that province in the nets described under the

Ptarmigan were said to be abundant in Shinshiu, being found on 
most of the high peaks of the Tate-Yama range. 

We did not succeed in getting any specimens, although feathers were 
seen and identified. The summits of most of the peaks are very rugged. 
Broken masses of rock with crevasses and overhanging ledges bar the 
way. These are covered with a kind of dwarf pine the roots of which 
form a network over and around the rocks, leaving many sheltered 
places underneath. In these places the ptarmigan find protection in 
cold weather, where, of course, it is impossible to follow them. 

In summer we were told by the natives that they were very abundant 
and tame, and quantities of them are killed for offerings at the mountain 
shrines. 

These birds are popularly believed to be under the special protection 
of the God of Thunder, and no mountain on which they are found will 
be subject to violent thunder-storms. Hence they are held in high 
veneration by the natives. 

Through the kindness of Captain Blakiston I have been able to ex- 
amine two specimens, an adult and a young in first plumage, which 



316 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

were obtained in Shinshiu in summer, through Mr. I. Arai, chief of the 
Survey Department. 

The general plumage of the adult is dusky, all the feathers are closely 
barred with ochraceous. Middle of breast and belly white. No Hue 
through the eye. Wing pure white, the primaries with black shaft 
lines ; tail black. This specimen measures, wing 180 Ium , tarsus 36 mm , 
middle toe without nail 28 mm , culinen 15 1 " 1 ", depth of bill 7 nm '. 

Young in first plumage : Upper parts rich chestnut brown and dusky. 
All the feathers of the back with large white tips. Wing and tail 
barred with yellow and dusky. Sides of head, throat, and belly pale 
yellow. Crown and line from the bill rich chocolate brown. This bird, 
occurring in such an isolated region, is probably a localized race, but in 
default of adequate descriptions and specimens for comparison I have 
been unable to identify the species.

By W. II. DALL. 

The marine fauna of the American coast south from Gape Hatteras 
an<l thence to the Mexico-Texan border is at present less known than 
that of any oilier part of the coast of North America. Every contribu- 
tion* toward bettering our information possesses a certain value, even 



*In the preparation of this list the following publications have been consulted, 
beside others of a more general nature:

if imperfect, and when those of all classes are enumerated the lis*" re- 
mains still extremely meager, and so far without any first-class general 
work of reference. 

In the absence of a good collection of named specimens from the 
region, it is difficult and tedious work identifying specimens connected, 
as the South Florida shells are, with the West Indian fauna. Conse- 
quently it is with a certain diffidence that I attempted, at Mr. Hemp- 
hiTs request, to work up the extremely interesting collection he has 
given to the National .Museum. The only catalogues relating to South 
Florida are extremely imperfect though praiseworthy attempts. Con- 
rad's woi k was never complete and is antiquated ; the paper of Mr. 
Melvill is marred by the inaccuracies of identification for which the 
present Mr. Sowerby is famous; Mr. Calkins' work is the best of all, 
but would have been more useful if the specimens actually collected by

liiin had been discriminated in some way from those quoted from other 
authors, whose localities or identifications may not have been accurate, 
or at least may not have been confirmed. It is known to most persons 
interested that the Smithsonian collection of East American shells, es- 
pecially those belonging south of New York, was in the hands of Dr. 
Stimpson, and with his own matchless collection was destroyed totally 
by the lire at Chicago in 1871. 

Under these circumstances, believing it better to make some sort of 
start at cataloging the shells of our southern coast (even at the risk of 
some erroneous identifications) than #o wait for opportunities which do 
not seem likely to be soon offered, the present list has been prepared in 
the hope that its deficiencies may stimulate others to correct and en- 
large it from specimens actually obtained on the spot. Early collectors 
were less careful about localities than those of the present day, and fre- 
quently took the careless assertions of sailors and dealers as a sufficient 
statement for determining lots of shells which were often mixed with 
others from different regions. Varieties were often independently de- 
scribed as distinct species, and allied species lumped by undiscriminat- 
ing writers or collectors under one name. This is very evident in some 
of the publications cited. In the present paper no attempt has been 
made to elaborate synonymy. 

The present collection comprises only small and inconspicuous spe- 
cies. The large and common forms, though doubtless collected, were 
not sent. The careful notes as to station and locality made by Mr. 
Hemphill greatly increase the value of the catalogue. Few collectors 
equal him in painstaking care in these particulars, and the reputation 
he has so justly gained on the western coast will only be enhanced by 
his Florida work. 

Several forms appear to be new. They are described subject to fu- 
ture corrections, but only after carefully searching the literature and 
monographs in vain. It is possible that some of them may have been 
previously named, yet if this should prove to be the case no great harm 
will ensue. Those identified from descriptions without figures are 
marked with an asterisk. Mr. VV. G. Binuey has kindly examined the 
Pulmonates and identified several doubtful species for me. 

It must be clearly understood that the list makes no pretensions to 
completeness. 

The fauna of South Florida is largely identical with that of the West 
Indies, and preseuts a curious mixture of tropical and temperate forms. 
When the species are thoroughly known the analogies between this 
fauna and that of the western coast of America in the same latitude 
will perhaps appear more prominently than at present. Certain west 
coast species have been wrongly ascribed to Florida, but there are some 
which are common to the two regions, aud quite a number which present 
marked similarity, though entitled to different specific names. Certain 
northern species appear here with their ordinary characters ; others

are modified so as to almost appear distinct. The demarcation between 
the molluscan fauna of Northern and Western Florida and that of the 
Keys is less distinct than has been supposed, but it is still sufficiently 
evident. 

LAND AND FRESH-WATER GASTROPODA. 

Veronicella floridana Binney. 

Sarasota Bay, a new locality for the species. Mr. Hemphill observes 
that when at rest it becomes of a broad, oval form, but is long and 
narrow when in motion ; its color changes very little by immersion in 
alcohol. 
Helix (Mesodon) mobiliana Lt-a. 

Rare at Tampa. This is the genuine mobiliana, not the species long 
confounded with it by authors. Mr. Binney names it 77. jejuna Say, 
and considers the two nearly or quite identical. 

Helix (Triodopsis) hopetonensis Shuttleworth. 

Four dead specimens were found by Mr. Hemphill at Fernandina, in 
April, 1883. Also at Cedar Keys, not rare. 

Helix (Polygyra) pustula Ffer. 

Cedar Keys, not rare. 
Helix (Polygyra) septemvolva Say. 

Key West and Sarasota Key, plenty. Walls of Fort Marion (San 
Marco) and elsewhere at Saint Augustine, very abundant and variable. 
Mr. Hemphill sends series, showing wide variation in form, size, and 
color, and concludes that septemvolva, cereolus, and carpenteriana are 
possibly merely isolated terms in one really continuous specific series. 

Helix (Polygyra) volvoxis Pow. 

Tampa and Saint Augustine, abundant. Identified by Mr. Binney. 
A variety of the preceding. 

Helix (Polygyra) carpenteriana Bland. 

Cedar Keys and Key West, abundant. Extremely variable in color 
and form, as well as size. 
Helix (Polygyra) avara Say. 

Jacksonville, not very common. 
Strobila labyrinthica Say. 

Rare at Sarasota Bay, a new locality for the species. 
Pupa incana Binney. 
Key West, common. 

Leiichocheila rupicola Say.

Macroceramus pontificus (Gould) Bland. 

Key West. 

Cylindrella poeyana D'Orb. 

Key West, not rare. 

* * * 

Zonites suppresses Say. 
Fernandina, not rare. 

Zonites (Hyalina) arborea Say. 

Cedar Keys. From the way in which European specialists are split- 
ting up the older species of Hyalina, there seem to be fair reasons for 
retaining for the American forms their American names. 

The same may be said for our common Conulus, for which, or for stages 
of which, some European authors have lately proposed now names. 

Zonites (Hyalina; minuscula Binney. 
Tampa, not rare 

Zonites (Conulus) egena Say. 

Cedar Keys and Fernandina, not very rare. It differs slightly in 
form and color from the European Conulus fulvus Drap, though doubt- 
less not more than European specimens of that species among them- 
selves. 

* * # 

Succinea campestris Saj . 

Key West and abundantly at Fernandina, the latter of larger size. 
These are the genuine campestris of Say. 
Succinea? aurea Lea. 

Fernandina, not rare. Identified by Mr. Binney. 

Succinea? obliqua Say. 

Walls of Fort Marion, San Marco, Saint Augustine, abundant Mr. 
Binney is disposed to refer these to campestris junior, but they appear to 
me more elongated. 
Planorbis dilatatus Gould. 

In a pond at Saint Augustine. This is about the most southern 
locality yet reported. 

Melampus bidentatus Say. 

Tampa, in marshes near high- water mark, abundant; Cedar Keys, in 
similar situations; Saint Augustine, plenty. 

Melampus flavus Gmelin.* 

Fernandina, abundant. Many specimens of M. bidentatus seem dis- 
tinguished from this form chiefly by size. This* group appears much in 
need of a general revision. 

Melampus caffeus Lam." 

Key West, not very plenty ; associated with the next species. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 323 

Tralia cingulata l'fr. 

Key West, found at extreme high-water, burrowing under stones six 
inches below the surface; gregarious, nestling together in colonies, 
together with Melampus caffeus, but much more abundant. 

Pedipes naticoides Stearns. 

Key West, plenty under stones at high tide. The specimens are con- 
siderably larger than the type from which Mi. Stearns described this 
interesting species. 

Leuconia hempLrillii n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 6.) 

Shell six-whorled, thin, elongate-oval, marked with fine striae of growth; 
whorls inflated, but closely appressed at the suture, last whorl more 
than half the length of the shell; color, waxen whitish, with a broad 
wine-colored band around the periphery, except of the earlier whorls, 
a blush of the same color on the base and outer lip, darkening to a 
deeper stain on the columella; last whorl somewhat contracted toward 
the aperture; outer lip thin, not acute, rounded anteriorly and passing 
into the thick and strongly twisted columella without interruption. 
Lon.,3.75 mm ; lat., 1.50 mm ; Ion. of last whorl, 2.50 ,nm ; of aperture, L.50 n,m . 

Habitat on the mudflats at Cedar Keys, rare. This little species is 
the first known to inhabit the United States, the L. sai/i of Kuster being 
without doubt referable to Tralia cingulata. None of the genus are 
reported from the adjacent shores of the Antilles by the authorities I 
have been able to consult, and it is not liable to be confused with any 

of the exotic species. 

# * * 

Siphouaria alternata Say. 

Key West, plenty on rocks between tides. 
Siphonaria naufragum Stearns. 

Saint Augustine, not rare. 

This fine species should be compared with 8. Uneolata D'Orb. from 
Cuba. 

TERRESTRIAL RHIPHIDOGLOSSA. 

Helicina subglobulosa Shnttlewortb.

Aplysia protea Rang. 

Key West, abundant on the beach, after a northerly gale. 

Utriculus canaliculatus Say. 

Sarasota Bay, plenty on the beach and abundant on the mud flats 
at Cedar Ke;ys. Quite variable. 

Bulla succinea Conrad. 

Mud flats at Cedar Keys, not rare. 

Bulla occidentalis A. Adams. 

Sarasota Key, not rare on beach. 
Actcson punctatus D'Orl>. 

Mud flats at Cedar Keys, not plenty. 
Marginella roscida Redfield. 

Abundant on the mud flats at Cedar Keys ; much larger specimens at 
Sarasota Bay in similar localities. 

Marginella redfieldii, Tryon. 

Key West. Three specimens, were found by Mr. Hemphill, on the 
beach, of a moderately large white MorgineUa, which appears from 
Tryon's figure to be the above species. 
Marginella minima, Guilding. 

Cedar Keys, rare, on the mud flats. According toMorch this is the 
same as M. lavalleana D'Orb. It has three plaits. 

Marginella opalina Stearns. 

Cedar Keys, with the last species, rare. 
Volutella lacrimula Gould. 

Plenty on the mud flats at Cedar Keys. Off the coast of Georgia in 
four hundred fathoms (Gould). 

Volvarina succinea Conrad. 

Cedar Keys, muddy flats between tides, plenty. Tampa, Conrad. 
This may be V. nitida Hinds, according to Tryon. 
Volvarina subtriplicata D'Orb. 

Key West. Mr. Hemphill found but three specimens, on massive 
rocks at low water. 

Olivella oryza Lara. 

Sarasota Bay, on the sand between tides. 

Olivella zonalis Lain. 

Sarasota Bay, with the last species. 
Olivella mutica Say. 

Cedar Keys, on the mud flats, not rare. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 325 
Acus dislocatus Say. 

Cedar Keys, between tides in the sand, abundant. These are rather 
darker and smaller than more northern ones. 

Acus protextus Conrad. 

Sarasota Bay, on the mud flats and in the sand between tides; those 
from the former loeality differ a little in color from those of the sandy 
beaches ; also rare on mud flats at Cedar Keys. The sculpture of this 
species varies in strength with its station. It was described by Conrad 
as a Ceritkium ! 

Nassa ambigua Mor. 

Key W est, rare on the beach. A common West Indian form. 

Hyanassa obsoleta Say. 

Saint Augustine, on mud between tides, abundant. 

Phos intricatus n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 9.) 

Shell with seven whorls, pale waxen, with a yellowish -brown epider- 
mis, strongly sculptured surface, turreted spire, solid texture, and single 
oval varix. Nucleus smooth, involved like Neritula ; next two whorls 
strongly cancellated, with two especially prominent spiral lines; later 
whorls subtabulate, moderately rounded, sculptured spirally, with strong, 
rounded, even threads, with single intercalary smaller threads in the 
iuterspaces ; the third or fourth primary thread, counting forward from 
the suture, is stronger than the others, and forms the margin of the tab- 
ulation ; anteriorly the primary threads become more distant and the 
interspaces deeper; counting forward from the marginal thread above 
mentioned, there are about fourteen of the primary threads on the front 
of the last whorl, all of which show traces of modulation at the intersec- 
tions, and the anterior six of which are strongly nodulous, though the 
transverse sculpture is hardly visible in the interspaces; the tran verse 
sculpture is composed of about fourteen rounded ribs, which cross the 
whorls. l>ut are overrun by the spiral threads ; also of rather well-marked 
lines of growth ; the aperture is marked by a strong rounded varix, 
over which the sculpture runs, the shell being apparently contracted 
before ami behind the varix; aperture rather small, within polished 
white, with five or six well-marked lira' inside the outer lip and the 
usual tooth like callus on the body near I he suture; canal short, slightly 
recurved; suture distinct; operculum brownish, thin, resembling that 
of Fu8U8. Lon. of shell, 13.2; of last whorl, 8.7; of aperture, 6.0; max. 
lat. of shell, 6.2; of aperture, l'.o 1 ""'. Habitat, Key West; abundant 
under .stones between tides. 

It is possible that this is "Oeinebra cyclostoma Sby." of Melvill's list, 
a species I do not know, but it is at all events a Phos and not eyclosto- 
mate. It is distinct from any of the species <>!' Phos ascribed to the 
West Indies of which figures are accessible, and from any of the species

referred to in Petit's or Tryon's catalogue of the genus. Yet I describe 
it with hesitation, since it seems extraordinary that so common a sin II 
should not have been already described. 

Astyris lunata Say. 

Tampa, abundant on the "coon oysters;" also at Cedar Keys, all 
varieties, very common on the sand between tides. 

Nitidella cribraria Lain. Melanitic variety. 

Key West, abundant under stones between high and low water. 

Anachis avara Say. 

Key West, <>n massive rocks at low water, abundant; many varieties 
of color. 

Anachis semiplicata Stearns 

Sarasota Bay, ran-, on the beach. Also at Cedar Keys. 

Anachis acuta Stearns. 

Sarasota Key, on the beach, rare. 

Anachis ostreicola Melvill. 

Cedar Keys, on "coon oysters," stones, &c. 

This species was not described by Melvill, but is evidently what he 
refers to. It is exactly like A. cancellata Gaskoin, except in size, being 
much smaller than Reeve represents the latter to be, but I have no speci- 
mens of Gaskoin's species to compare it with. Melvill says it is allied 
to J., nigricans, which is a Panama species. 

Columbella rustica Lin. 
Cedar Keys, living. 

Eupleura caudata Say. 

Cedar Keys, very hue. Stunted specimens of this species have been 
referred erroneously to E. murlci/ormis Brod., a west coast species. 

Urosalpinx tampaensis Conrad. 

Sarasota, on oysters brought in by boats, and also on v<x^ cases of 
Btisycon jwrversum, which it is fond of devouring. This seems to me 
quite in place in this genus, and not referable to Eupleura, from the 
shell. Also at Cedar Keys. The operculum is purpuroid. 

Urosalpinx cinereus Say. 

Cedar Keys, on rocks, oysters, &c, ami in similar localities at Saint 
Augustine. The Southern specimens are brighter colored and more 
neatly sculptured than those from New England, but doubtless quito 
as destructive. It is the "drill" of the oystermen, and very injurious 
to their young oyster "seed." Operculum purpuroid. 

Muricidea floridana Conrad. 

On rocks, oysters, &c, between tides at Sarasota Bay. The opercu- 
lum is muricoid and it is not a Urosalpinx. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 327 

Muricidea n. s. ? 

Young specimens of a Muricidea were obtained by Mr. Hemphill at 
Cedar Keys, which do not agree with any species reported. It resem- 
bles the young of Urosalpinx cinereus, but is thinner, broader, and with 
a proportionally larger aperture within which are two brown revolving 
bauds. The operculum is muricoid. If new, it may be called H. 
lit nipJiillii. 

Iieucozonia cingulifera Lam. 

Key West, on rocks at low water, rare. 

Not to be confounded with L. cingulata, a very distinct West Ameri- 
can species. This is probably what is reported by several authors as 
L. Knorrii Deshayes. The animal is stated by Melvi'l to be of the color 
of raw beef. He obtained it from Key West on the coral reefs. 

Tritonidea tincta Conrad. 

Cedar Keys, rocks between tides. Florida Keys (Calkins). 

This has been confounded with the quite distinct T. ringens, from the 
western coast of America. It is probably the "Cantharus coromandelianus 
Lam." of Melvill's list. He obtained it at Key West, abundantly, on the 
reefs. It recalls the T. insignia of Reeve much more than the ringens, 
but is quite different from either. 

Tritonidea cancellaria Conrad. 

Cedar Keys, Calkins and Hemphill. Ship Island, Gulf of Mexico, 
Conrad. It is likely that Tritonidea floridana Petit is a mere variety of 
this shell. 

Mitra albicostata C. 15. Adams. 

Key West; reefs at low water, rare. Jamaica (C. B. Ad.) Adams 
described this species under the above name. Morch apparently re- 
fers to it under the uame albocincta U C. B. Ad.," but I have not been 
able to find that the name was altered by Adams. 

Mitra sulcata Grnelin. 

Key West; rare, with the last and next species. Not uncommon in 
the Antilles. 

Mitra (Mitromorpha?) floridana n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 12.) 

Shell stout, with four normal and two embryonic; whorls, the latter 
smooth, the tip so obliquely twisted in as to appear reversed, the transi- 
tion from smooth to sculptured surface abrupt; shell fusiform, slender, 
the last whorl about two-thirds of the whole length : the whole deep red- 
brownish-black; surface cancellated by transverse and spiral stout 
threads pretty equally distributed, nodulous at their intersections and 
with deep interspaces; principal spiral threads increasing from three on 
the early whorls to ten or more on the last one: suture distinct, not 
channeled; aperture narrow, outer lip thick, not reflected Urate pos- 
teriorly; inner lip with a thin varnish of callus; four spiral plaits nearly

at right angles transversely to the axis of the shell, the posterior plate 
strongest, the others diminishing anteriorly, the last one separated by 
quite a space from the anterior edge of the column; notch dee]), not re 
tlected. Lou. of shell, 6.00; of last whorl, 4.50; of aperture, 3.2; max. 
hit. of shell, '2.5; of aperture, 1.00 mm . 

Habitat. — On the reefs at Key West, at low water; rare. This prettj 
h i tie shell resembles a Miira, but also recalls the forms named Mitro- 
morpha, by Carpenter, which seem to stand couchologicabv between 
the cones and mitras. 

Mangilia stellata Stearns.* 

Key West, abundant on the reefs at low water. I have not been abler 
to compare this with a typical specimen, but there is little doubt of its 
identity. 

Mangilia cerina Kurtz and Stimpson. 

Sarasota Bay, mud flats between tides, plenty; also in similar situa- 
tions at Cedar Keys.

Drillia aibomaculata D'Orb.* 

Sarasota Bay, on mud flats between tides, rare. This does not agree 
precisely with D'Orbigny's figure, but the differences do not seem to be 
of specitio value, and may be due to defects in the figure. I have not 
been able to compare types. 

Drillia thea n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 5.) 

Shell elongated, slender, eight whorled, colored olivaceous like the 
leaves of tea which have been steeped, weathering ashy; apex small, 
rather blunt: whorls moderately convex, covered with a shining very 
thin epidermis, marked by silky lines of growth, sculptured by about 
eleven somewhat ODlique slightly curved ribs, which are broadest, stout- 
est, and paler than the rest of the shell on the periphery, fading away 
toward the sutures and not distinctly differentiated from the inter- 
spaces, somewhat irregularly waved, and concave anteriorly; also by 
evanescent spiral strise not always visible and eight or ten raised spiral 
threads on the anterior third of the last whorl ; notch deep, rounded, 
leaving no fasciole; canal short, straight; sutures distinct, slightly 
appressed; aperture wide, short, internally claret brown; inner lip with 
a slight callus; outer lip much carved forward, polished and smooth 
within. Lon. ot shell, 15.0; of last whorl, 8.0; of aperture, 5.~>; max. 
hit. of shell, 5.2 mi ". 

Habitat. — Sarasota Bay, rare, on mud flats between tides. Two 
specimens. 

Drillia leucocyma n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 8.) 

Shell small, dark, solid, strongly sculptured, with about seven whorls, 
of which the basal color is a very dark olivaceous brown ; the interior 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 329 

is of a claret brown which modifies the external color by transmitted 
light ; spiral sculpture, a strong broad thread close to the inconspicuous 
suture, separated by a rather broad spirally striated fasciole from a series 
of two (on the early) to four (on the last whorl) rather strong, spiral 
smooth rounded threads which are succeeded anteriorly by eight or ten 
similar spiral threads which, on the base, are nodulous and smoother 
on the anterior end of the shell ; these are crossed by stria* of growth and 
partly by nine to eleven stout stiort ribs, beginning at tbe fasciole and 
ceasing just beyond the periphery; the most prominent part of these 
are white and the threads which pass over them become yellowish or 
white and stronger than they are between the ribs ; the little nodules 
on the basal threads have a tendency to whiten as does also thesutural 
thread; this is, however, hardly noticeable without a lens; canal short, 
wide, straight, notch moderately wide, not deep; aperture rather nar- 
row, smooth and claret brown, outer lip not much curved out: Ion. of 
shell, 7.5; of last whorl, 4.0; of aperture, 2.75; hit, of shell, 2.70""". 

Habitat. — Key West; rare on the reefs at low water. This recalls 
I), albomaculata D'Orbiguy, but is more slender, and differs in the 
details of sculpture. -Tne last whorl of the specimen figured shows an 
interruption of the sculpture due to a fracture. 

Drillia linionitella n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 10. ) 

Shell small, thin, translucent, lemon yellow ; in fresh specimens the 
dried animal matter shows through and gives the upper whorls a livid 
ashy or greenish tinge; there is also a reddish tinge on the columella; 
the young shells have much the appearance of a Beta, but doubtless 
develop a thickened outer lip and more pronounced notch with 
maturity, since several nearly mature ones show indications of it- 
Whorls eight or nine, turrited, angulated by the ribs on the periphery, 
with a small nearly smooth nucleus, and sharply sculptured subsequent 
surface; spiral sculpture of numerous sharp threads, quite fine, and 
extending over the whole shell; two stronger closely adjacent threads 
at the hardly visible suture; transverse sculpture of strongly marked 
lines of growth, and about a dozen uniform, narrow, sharply elevated 
riblets, convex anteriorly, extending from suture to suture, and nodu- 
lated with an elongated nodule at the peripheral angle ; fasciole faintly 
marked, notch distinct, canal short, straight, aperture rather narrow ; 
Ion. of shell, i>.7~> : of last whorl, .">.7.~>; of aperture, 2.5; max. lat. of 
shell. 2.75""". 

Habitat. — Cedar Keys, on mud Hats between tides. This resembles 
a miniature M. cerina K. & S., but is differently and much more 
sharply sculptured.

En lima conoidea K. A. S. 

Cedar Keys, on mudflats between tides, not common. This agrees 
with the diagnosis of the species cited, but T have not seen an authentic 
specimen ot Kurtz and Stimpson's shell. 

Eulimella B[>. indet. 

Cedar Keys. A small pinkish-white and very pretty shell. 
Eulima (Leiostraca?) hemphillii n. s. (Piute X, Fig. 4.) 

Shell slender, straight, acute, brilliantly polished, black when fresh 
(when faded, or by transmitted light, dark claret brown), with nine or 
ten flattened whorls; sutures appressed, nearly invisible except by 
transmitted light ; aperture rounded in front, pointed behind ; outer lip 
slightly thickened, passing imperceptibly into the inner lip, which is 
slightly twisted; shell rather thin and without noticeable deposit of 
callus. Lon. of shell, 3.00 ; of last whorl, 1.60 ; of aperture, 0.87; max. 
kit., 1.00""". 

Habitat. — Cedar Keys, mud. flats between tides, six specimens only. 

This very beautiful little shell appears to be in all respects, except 
color, a typical Eulima, but forms a remarkable exception to the glisten- 
ing white which is so uniformly characteristic of the other species 
known. When lirst received they appeared absolutely black, but the 
color is less dense than at first, though still nearly black. Many of the 
species of Eulimella or Leiostraca have bands of color on the shell, and 
it is possible that this one may belong rather with them than with the 
typical Eulimas. 

Obeliscus tesselatus Adams. * 

Cedar Keys mud flats, between tides, abundant. 1 have not been 
able to compare specimens of Adams species. This is probably what 
is referred to as 0. terebellvm by Sowerby and Melvill; it is certainly 
not that species nor the crenulatm of Holmes. It is not at all improb- 
able, however, that the 0. dolabratus (=terebellum) may turn up in South 
Florida, as it is commom in the Antilles. 

Pyramidella ? vincta n. 8. (Plate X, Fig. 7.) 

Shell elongated, slender, suhcylindrical, apex pointed, with a minute 
pellucid smooth sinistral half-immersed nucleus and ten or twelve 
strongly spirally sculptured whorls. Color whitish (specimens all dead, 
one immature, one fresh); spiral sculptuie begins with two strong 
elevated ridges with deep channels between them and separating them 
from the ridges of the next whorl; the posterior ridge is crowded with 
strong fig-shaped nodules with the broad ends backward and axes par- 
allel with the axis of the shell; the anterior ridge is not nodulous; on 
about the fifth whorl from the nucleus the nodulous ridge becomes 
double, and the figs become oranges, or round nodules, which later are 
even somewhat elongated in the direction of the ridges; the other 
ridge remains simple and su:ooth ; at the periphery of the base are two 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 3.'U 

closely approximated smaller ridges upon which the posterior nodulous 
ridge grows with the whorl ; the suture therefore is invisible and the 
deep channel above it only simulates a suture; on the base arc two 
very strong spiral ridges, rather squarish, which run directly into the 
throat of the aperture; the pillar is twisted, especially in the young; 
it forms a small sharp emargination like that in some species of Bittium, 
tin; outer lip is simple except so far as modified by the sculpture; if 
the outer lip be broken away half a turn, two very strong sharp plica, 
transverse to the axis, appear on the pillar and continue up the spire, 
exactly as in Nerinea ; on the outside of the whorls there is little tran- 
verse sculpture except strong lines of growth; occasionally the stems 
of the "figs" are prolonged as pseudo-riblets in the interspaces. Lon. 
of shell, 8.5; of last whorl, 3.25; max. lat. of shell, 2.50'" m . 

Habitat. — Key West, rare, on the reel's at low water. 

This is a remarkable shell. It closely resembles Nerhua in many par- 
ticulars and externally is not unlike N. trinodosa as figured by Chenu. 
It differs from PyramideUa, to which it is provisionally referred, in its 
strong spiral sculpture, small number of plica?, and total absence of 
callosities. 

Odostomia impressa Say. 

Tampa, on oysters, abundant; also in similar situations at Cedar 
Keys and at Saiut Augustine. A variety (?) granatina occurs at Cedar 
Keys in which the posterior ribs are strongly nodulous, and the appear- 
ance thus rendered so different from the type as to suggest they are 
specifically distinct. 

Odostomia acutidens n. s. 

Shell solid, rude, yellowish-white, acute, six-whorled, marked with 
lines of growth merely; suture evident, but not channeled; whorls 
rather flat, except the last, which has a neatly rounded base; aperture 
with the outer lip acute, rounded to the columella, which stands out from 
the surface of the shell, with a groove behind it, but no umbilicus; 
column with one large, very sharp tooth at right angles to the axis of 
the shell; space between the columella and posterior end of the outer 
lip polished, not callous. Lon. of shell, 4.12; of last whorl, 2.50; of 
aperture, 1.75; max. lat. of shell, 2.00 mm . 

Habitat. — Cedar Keys, on the mud flats; not common. 

Partheuia cedrosa n. s. (Plate X, Fig. 11.) 

Shell slender, subcylindrical, whitish, thin, seveu-whorled; nucleus 
sinistral, smooth, remainder except the base reticulated by equal, mod- 
erately strong plications, extending from suture to suture, but ceasing 
at the periphery of the base, about four to a millimeter, with lesser iter- 
spaces; underlaid and reticulated by revolving threads, about six on 
the side of the whorls, and as many more, but fainter, on the base; apex 
minute, blunt; base rounded; aperture as in Turboiiilla. with thin

margins and pillar, on which last is an obsolete, or extremely faint, 
plait-like callosity or twist ; no umbilicus; operculum translucent, ex- 
tremely thin, subspiral, horny. Lon. of shell, 5.5; of last whorl, 2.25; 
of aperture, 1.50; max. lat. of shell, 1.50 m,n . 

Habitat. — Oedar Keys, on mud Hats; very rare. I am not sure that 
I am right in referring this species to Parthenia. It appears like a 
white reticulately sculptured Turbonilla,, with a taint plait. 

Turbonilla viridaria n. s. 

Shell slender, yellowish waxen, with red-brown spiral lines and base; 
sixteen whorls, with about (on the last whorl) twenty-five transverse 
riblets; base scored with fine spiral grooves, otherwise smooth; aper- 
ture squarish, rounded in front ; nucleus smooth, sinistral, blunt; trans- 
verse ribs extending from suture to suture, slightly oblique, nearly 
continuous along the spire, the line from base to nucleus making about 
half a volution, in a posterior sense; whorls flattened, making the out- 
line of the spine nearly a true conic section; suture distinct; riblets 
rounded, smooth, subequal from end to end ; spiral grooves appear 
sharply and distinctly cut, running (apparently) under the ribs, with 
red or brown color in the grooves, as if rubbed in ; there are three or 
four from the suture forward, then a distinctly wider interspace, then 
two more to the suture, or about five to the ends of the ribs on the hist 
whorl, which little more than pass the periphery; base smooth, red - 
brown, with distinct spiral grooves, more crowded toward the axis; 
whole shell neatly polished, with a tendency to weather ashy or white. 
Lon. of shell, 11.0; of last whorl, 2.25; max. lat. of shell, 2.25 mm . 

Habitat. — Cedar Keys, among the sea grass on the mud flats; not rare. 

This is nearest T. rathbuni Verrill, which has twelve whorls to a 
length of 13.0 and a width of 4.0""". 
Turbonilla ( viridaria var. :') virga a. s. .' 

Shell resembling the last, but slenderer and more drawn out, much 
smaller, with a larger and narrower aperture, and with more regular 
spiral grooves, which are not colored, and fewer ribs. Whorls seven, 
with about fifteen transverse ribs, larger and carried farther over the 
periphery than in the preceding species; a tinge of claret color on the 
pillar, elsewhere greenish, translucent. Lat. of shed, 1.0; lon. of shell, 
.;.l: of last whorl, 1.5"»». 

Habitat. — Cedar Keys with the last species. This was sent by Mr. 
Hemphill as the young of the preceding, but differs from specimens of 
its own size in having one whorl less in the same length and in having 
the grooves without color ami evenly distributed, and in other^eatures 
as above. It is probably distinct, but 1 prefer to leave it as a variety 
for the present. 

Turbonilla (viridaria var. .') pvmicea 11. s. .' 

Shell resembling viridaria but smaller, with thirteen whorls; color whit- 
ish at the tip, gradually becoming more and more tinted with a clear

<-l;irci brown, the last whorl being the darkest ; riblets fainter, less pro- 
duced anteriorly, lust whorl with hardly any ribs; spiral sculpture 
liner and closer and lines much more numerous than in that species; 
they are also uncolored; the whorls are more rounded and there are 
about eighteen instead of twenty-five ribs, which do not reach so far 
forward. Max. lat. of shell, 1.07; Ion. of shell, 8.0 ; of last whorl, i.75 mm . 

Habitat. — Cedar Keys; with the last. This species at first sight ap- 
pears extremely distinct from viridaria, but a careful examination w ith a 
lens shows that the differences are chiefly in color and strength of 
sculpture. However, it seems well entitled to a varietal name, and may 
on further examination prove to be distinct. 

These Turbonillas are a very puzzling group, with few good charac- 
ters for diagnosis, but the above appear distinct from any ascribed to 
the West Indies or the eastern coast of the United States.

Cerithidea scalariformis Say.

Melvill reports " C. cras.silabrum Ad." from Cedar Keys, which is

others; neither name appeals to be known to other authors in connec- 
tion with the fauna of the southern coast or the West Indies. 

Cerithidea turrita Stearns. 

Key West, in the salt ponds, rather rare; all the specimens are some- 
what distorted, perhaps from excess of salt.

Mouth of the Manatee River, abundant, but mostly immature. A 
good series should be compared with the preceding species. 

Vermetus iumbricalis L., var. nigricans. 

Sarasota Bay, in masses near high water. All the figures of Iumbri- 
calis seem to represent something quite different from the small, black, 
gregarious Vermetus of our Florida coast, which almost makes reels with 
its solidly aggregated masses whose interstices rapidly fill with other 
solid matter. Kor this extremely familiar form the varietal term of 
nigricans is therefore proposed uutil a careful study of the group shall 
determine what the typical Iumbricalis really is.

Pissurella altemata Say. 

Cedar Keys, on rocks between tides. 

Lucapina ? fasciata Pfr. 

Key West, on rocks at extreme low water: only two living ones 
•were obtained. From these it is evident that this animal does not be- 
long to the same genus as the great Lucapina crenulata of California, 
but in the present confused state of the Fissurellidce it is impracticable 
to state positively where it should be placed. The shell is about one- 
third covered by the mantle and the anterior (shorter) end is depressed, 
the body of the animal being much thicker behind; the posterior part of 
the shell is raised and its upper surface is therefore directed forward 
and upward. The soft parts (in alcohol) are of a whitish color ; the 
margin of the mantle, which has a smooth surface and simple or non- 
papillose edge, extends widely around the shell, falling and covering 
the head, sides, and back of the foot like a curtain; the branchiae are 
symmetrical, their tips extend forward to the top of the head ; the sides 
of the foot and top of the head and muzzle are speckled with reddish 
brown, smooth and with only a single series of lateral papillae ; these 
papilla 1 begin at the anterior part of the foot ou a longitudinal line with 
the tentacles, the anterior ones are about one-third as large as the ten- 
tacles (every alternate one, however, being much smaller); they rapidly 
diminish in size backward and become more distant and uniform (or the 
small intercalary ones disappear); there are altogether about twenty ou 
each side; the muzzle is long, granulose and rather broad at the end 
and divided in the middle line below; the tentacles are clavate, long, 
with large, black eyes situated on stont tubercles at their outer bases; 
behind the right eye-tubercle and proceeding from its base is a tentac 
ular process, sleuder, cylindrical or longitudinally wrinkled and slightly 
hooked at the end, which may be an intromittent organ; it was much 
smaller in one specimen than in the other, and in that specimen the lat- 
eral papilla? were also smaller and less numerous; the difference seemed 
disproportionate to the difference in total size, but these organs are quite 
variable in this respect, and part of the difference may have been due 
to shrinkage from different strengths of alcohol in which they were 
originally immersed. The dorsal aperture, as in other Fissurellidce, 
serves the purpose of an excurreut sewer and is nearly filled by t In- 
large, oval papilla, through which the rectum opens, and a simple bill 
of mautle edge. The whole creature is much more like Fissurellidcea 
bimaculata Dall of California, both shell and soft parts, than like the so- 
called Lucapina referred to. The characters of the typical species must 
be more closely inquired into before the proper allotment of the differ- 
ent forms included in the different genera can be Anally decided.

Isclmochiton.multicostatus C. B. Adams.* 

Key West, with the last, but rare. I have not been able to compare 
either of these species with authentic types of the species to which they 
are here referred, but they are certainly Ischnochitons and probably 
these species. Air. Hemphill, whose experience and success in collect 
ing Chitons is well known to those interested in that groups culls at- 
tention in his notes to the fact that he found only these two species in 
the localities in Florida which he visited. Mr. Calkins reports Chiton 
piceus (imelin, and Chcetopleura apiculata Say, abundant in the Keys; 
is this due to erroneous identifications (so frequent in this difficult 
group), or do the species have different times for approaching the 
shore S Melvill does not mention any Chitons. They are compar- 
atively rare in the West Indies. In the Blake Mollusca I lnive de- 
scribed a fine species, Hanleyia tropicalis, from one hundred and twen- 
ty-eight fathoms off Sand Key.

Shell porcellauous, thick; with color markings; covered with a glisten 
ing dense vVrnicose epidermis ; without lunule or escutcheon ; liga- 
ment stout, very short, wholly external, nearly central, but placed a lit- 
tle more to the same side of the beaks as the pallia! sinus, that is to 
say, posterior; almost covered by the umbones ; margin crenulated; 
muscular impressions large, strong, subequal ; pallial line with a small 
rouuded sinus ; hinge with one simple large un grooved triangular 
tooth in the right valve under the subcentral umbo; the posterior 
margin of the shell obsoletely grooved; left valve with two stout di- 
varicating simple teeth, with a triangular space between them ; an ob- 
solete groove on the anterior shell margin ; soft parts unknown ; animal 
viviparous. 

I am indebted to Mr. Tryon for informing me of Conrad's description 
which 1 had overlooked, as it is in the midst of irrelevant matters and 
1 believe has never been noticed by any other author. His diagnosis 
contains no differential characters, and he seems to have overlooked 
altogether some of the most important. He was afterwards, according 
to Mr. Tryon's note, disposed to unite it with Goodallia of Turton, which 
it resembles in a general way ; but that shell appears not to differ from 
Astarte; has an entire pallial line ; the large triangular tooth is gen- 
erally grooved, though sometimes very faintly; the ligament is long as 
in Astarte, and there is a distinct lunule. With regard to its reproduc- 
tion nothing is known.* Goodallia dates from 1822, and Mactrina 
Brown is synonymous with it.

This little shell was very briefly described by Mr. Conrad. It is of 
a yellowish color, with a purple stain inside in many specimens, which 
is visible outside as a purple ray which includes and is strongest on 
the beaks; the epidermis is straw-colored and of most brilliant polish : 
the form of the shell subtriangular, becoming ventrally elongated with 

"After examination of many specimens of the type of Goodallia I have been able t<> 
find nothing but eggs. These were few in number in each specimen, and dispropor- 
tionately large. The genus is probably oviparous.

age and disproportionately thick ; in one specimen I found nearly fifty 
young ones, about 0.20 mm in diameter, lenticular, extremely thin, but 
already showing the purple tinge, rather compressed and with hardly 
perceptible beaks, while the adult is inflated with very prominent 
beaks. The dimensions of a fully adult specimen are 3.0 ,lH " high. L'.LT)""" 
in greatest length, and 2.5 mm in greatest thickness. They were ob- 
tained by Mr. Hemphill at Cedar Keys on mud flats, and at Sarasota 
Bay on the beach, abundantly. Conrad's specimens came from Tampa 
Bay. The relations of this beautiful little shell are uncertain, but until 
more is known I should be disposed to keep it in the vicinity of Astarte, 
which, so far as the shell is concerned, appears to be its nearest relative, 
though I do not feel confident that this will be its permanent location. 

Crassatella (Eriphyla) lunulata Conrad. 

Beach of Sarasota Island, plenty but dead. 

There is little room for doubt that this name should take precedence 
over mactracea Linsley and that the two names refer to one and the 
same species. The specimens are the bright southern form of " Gouldia? 
mactracea of authors. 

Cytherea (Transennella?) conradina 11. s. 

Shell of much the same general form of C. cuneimeris Conrad, but with- 
out the radiating sculpture and the strong sculpture on the ribs. The 
color is nearly white with fine zigzag markings of yellow ; a touch of 
pink internally in some valves ; exterior smooth, or concentrically 
grooved; lnnule marked by a strongly impressed line, proportionately 
large ; escutcheon not distinguishable ; shell moderately inflated, beaks 
not very prominent, recalling Gyrenafioridana in shape but more rounded 
off'; interior smooth, pallial sinus moderate, angular; beaks subcentral; 
margin internally grooved at right angles to the hypothetical radii of 
growth. Long, 8.0 mm ; altitude, 5.7 mm ; diameter, ,3.5 mm . 

Habitat. — Bare at Cedar Keys, in mud between tides. 

The most remarkable feature of this shell is the internal grooving of 
the margins. The ventral margin is deeply scored parallel to the long 
axis of the shell, the grooves turning upward at the ends, while on each 
side of the beaks the margin is closely and deeply grooved in a direction 
nearly parallel to theanterior and posterior slopes. 1 have seen nothing 
like it in any other bivalve. The grooves are not, as might be supposed, 
parallel with the lines of growth but invariably, except at the center of 
the base, form a more or less acute angle with them. The only analogue 
to such sculpture known to me occurs on the outside of such Lucinidce as 
the Lamarckian L. divaricata, Woodia, and some Nuculidce and Yoldias. 
But on the inside of any shell such sculpture has not, so far as I am 
aware, been reported, apart from structures appertaining to the hinge. 
Several gentlemen to whom the form in question has been submitted are 
unanimous in considering it as worthy of more than specific rank, and 
while I am yet in doubt as to the systematic value of the structure de-

This exquisite species deserves a more thorough examination. It 
appears to exist around the borders of the Gulf and of the Caribbean 
sea ; at least 1 have seen very much larger specimens from near Aspin- 
wall on the Isthmus. It resembles Mycetopus in several particulars, ami 
it is doubtful if the soft parts are similar to those of typical Modiola'. 
It is extremely similar to (and perhaps identical with) Modiola petagnce

Jt may be noted that the specific name alba is several times preoccu- 
pied in this genus, while neither Mr. Calkins' figure nor description are 
sufficient to identify the shell by. Indeed, so far as the former indi- 
cates anything, it is that the shell is not an Odostomia, but some form 
of Eulimella or Turbonilla. It is to be hoped Mr. Calkins will give fur- 
ther information in regard to it.

japonicns Hvass and C. nebidosus Solander, neither of whieh has been 
known from this region, and it may fairly be said, in view of some of 
the other identifications, that they still need confirmation by a com- 
petent authority. 

In a note Mr. Melvill adds in regard to — 

" Melaniadw and Unionidce. — At Key West 1 did not come across a 
single specimen of these families, which is not surprising in the inland 
torrents, but are fond of fresh water. I found several species in my 
North American travels, but very few in South Carolina, and those of 
no particular peculiarity of form" (1. c. p. 173). 

Perhaps some of our winter sojourners in Florida will take the hint, 
and more particularly examine the "inland torrents" of Key West for 
the missing shells. 

Mr. Hemphill also collected specimens of Glottidia \pyramidata Stimp- 
son, at Cedar Keys; which have been received as this paper was pass- 
ing through the press.

NECOIVD CATALOGUE OF A COLLECTION OF BIRDS MADE NEAR

Some of the more prominent characteristics of Lower California, 
south of the parallel of 24° 30', are as follows: 

The Gulf coast, including the islands of Espiritu Santo and Ceralvo, 
and the Pacific coast, from Cape St. Lucas to Todos Santos, is mount-

ainous, rocky, sandy, and very barren. The Victoria Mountains range 
from north to south in the center of the peninsula, parallel, in a general 
sense, to the Coast ranges, having their greatest height and breadth 
between Triumfo and Miraflores. The remaining portion of the tract 
under consideration consists principally of low table-lands or mesas and 
sandy arroyos. 

There is a belt of low, mostly fertile, land 15 or 20 miles wide, extend- 
ing from the Gulf at La Paz to the Pacific at and north of Todos Santos. 
so low, indeed, that if it should happen to sink about a hundred feet 
it would be submerged, and that portion of the peninsula lying south 
of it would become — what it has probably already been — an island. 

Taking this into consideration, together with the influence the Vic- 
toria Mountains have had and are having in this direction, it is not dim- 
cult to account for a local fauna of which it may be said much remains. 
to be learned. 

I have observed the following species, with others on the Pacific coast, 
from Cape St. Lucas to a point 30 miles north of Todos Santos, namely r 
Mim us polyglottus, Harporhynchw cinereus, PhaAnopepla nitens, Auriparus 
flaviceps, Campylorhynchus affinis, Pipilo fuscus albu/ula, Cardinalis 
virginianus igneus, Pyrrhuloxia simiata, Icterus cucullatus, (Jenturu* 
uropygialis, ColapteschryaoideSj and Picus scalaris lucasanus. These are 
a part of what I have termed the species of the cactus and mesquite 
thickets. The same species have been observed by me on the Gulf side 
as far north as 24° 30' or thereabouts. All of them are likely to occur 
much farther north on the Gulf side, being probably confined thereto 
by the desert, which covers nearly all the peninsula east of Magdalena 
Lay, and north to Commonder and far south toward Todos Santos. 

Other quite similar deserts northwest of Magdalena Bay must tend 
to restrict these birds to the Gulf coast, w T hich is mountainous, and has 
more or less fresh water, whereas, on the Pacific coast, for a distance 
of four or five hundred miles, there is not a drop of water, as 1 believe, 
upon what I consider reliable information, and actual observation. 

U. BIRDS OF THE MOUNTAINS. 

Arriving at La Paz December 15, 1882, 1 remained in Southern Lower 
California until March 23, 1883, much of this time being spent in the 
saddle. Only a small number of specimens were secured, although 
among them were several new or undescribed species. 

The most important localities visited were in the Victoria Mountains, 
which were probably never previously explored by any collector. 1 
ascended these mountains by three different trails on as many different 
spurs. The trail leading to Laguna is the longest, highest, and possihh 
the worst; however, 1 suppose either of them would be considered im- 
passable in any other country than Mexico. On this trail an altitude 
of about 5,000 feet was reached. Prom an altitude of about 3,500 feel 
and upward the flora was partly that of the temperate /one. 



;>4(j PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

This region is well watered and well timbered with medium- sized 
oaks and pines, the latter constituting about a tenth of the forest, being 
distributed unevenly among the oaks. Bunch grass was everywhere 
abundant. On February 1, the date of our arrival here, a Blackberry 
(Rubus)j a Black Currant (Ribes), the Ma (Iron a (Arbutus menziexi), a 
Monkey F'ower (Mimulus), the Painted Cap (Castilleia), a fine Lupine, 
(Lupmus), and a few other plants, were in flower and thriving, although 
the tender shoots of some of the annuals had been nipped by frost. 

An interesting Xolcna reminded us we were still in the tropics, 
although we had left the cactus and mesquite thickets with their char- 
acteristic species tar beneath us, or below an altitude of 1,5U0 feet. 

Upon meeting the first pines, I discovered almost simultaneously the 
long sought Cape Robin [Merula confinis Baird), the beautiful new 
Snowbird (Jtinco bairdi), and other interesting species. 

The purpose is not to give at this time an extended account of expe- 
riences here; but, instead, the following list is presented. It contains all 
the species known by me to occur in these mountains, although a change 
of season may change the avifauna, some species perhaps going north 
in spring, others from the surrounding low lauds replacing them. Per- 
haps some species escaped my notice by being iu the deep gorges so 
numerous in the Victoria Mountains. 

1. Hylocichla unalascas (Gin.). 
Common ; possibly resident. 

2. Merula confinis (Baird.) 

Only about a dozen Cape Robins were seen, and these were all on the 
Laguna trail. About half were found singly, one as low as 2,500 feet 
above sea level. 

.Mr. Cipriano Fisher, an American, who had often hunted deer at 
Laguna, informed me that Robins were sometimes abundant there. 
This may be the case when the berries of the California Holly (Hetero- 
meles), which grows abundantly in the neighborhood, are ripe. 

The type specimen, shot by Xantus at Todos Santos in summer, may 
have been a straggler from the mountains. Possibly there was a mistake 
made in recording it, as I suspect was the case with the Oreortyx picta 
plumifera (see Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.,Yol. 5, p. 533), which is not at 
present a bird of Cape St. Lucas; and this leads me to remark that I 
consider the term "Cape species," when it covers all the birds from La 
Paz and south of it, an inappropriate one — inappropriate for the good 
reason that so few of the so-called Cape species really occur at Cape 
St. Lucas — its only special advantage as a collecting ground being its 
well-sheltered harbor, which affords good opportunities for shooting 
marine species. 

3. Polioptila coerulea (Linn.). 

( Jommon, and probably the only Polioptila seen ; but it is not possible 
to be positive, as all the PolioptilcB of Southern Lower California look

The only individual observed was shot and wounded, but it escaped 
in rocks just as 1 was about to grasp it. * 

Afterward, near Pescadero, I saw a small flock, and secured a speci- 
men. It must be rare in Southern Lower California. 

18. Junco bairdi Belding. (See these Proceedings, p. 155.) 

This interesting - bird was very common in the Victoria Mountains 
above 3,000 feet altitude. Nothing worthy of note in connection with 
its habits was noticed. 

This species is so named in consideration of the valuable ornithological 
services of Prof. IS. F. Baird, in field and office, not the least of such 
services being his original, full, and accurate descriptions of so many 
!North American birds. 

[Two specimens received since the original description of the species 
was published agree exactly with the types in coloration, and measure 
as follows: No. 90048 $ ad., Laguna, Feb. 1883: Wing, 2.75; tail, 2.00;

Common on grassy hillsides above 2,500 feet altitude; usually seen 
in pairs in February.

• A humming bird, supposed to have been a female of this species, was 
observed, at about 4,000 feet altitude. Not observed at any other time 
above 2,000 feet, 0. costce thrives in barren, waterless tracts. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 349 

29. Basilimia xautusi (Lawr.). 

Decidedly abundant in the highest mountains, much more so than in 
the low country, where it is usually found near fresh water. 

30. Picus scalaris lucasanus (Xant.). 
Earely seen. 

31. Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis Baird. 

A specimen was obtained at Laguna, on February 1. Probably 
seen upon two other occasions. 

32. Melanerpes formicivorus angustifroiis Baird. 

Very abundant in the higher mountains. Colonies are occasionally 
found in the oaks as low as 700 feet altitude. 

33. Colaptes chrysoides (Malh.). 

I was unable to get a specimen of the flicker in the mountains. Saw 
but two or three individuals. As these had golden wing and tail shafts, 

I presume the species was as above given. 

34. Scops . 

The tremulous notes of a screech-owl were heard at several of the 
camps. Also at Agua Caliente and Miraflores. 

[This was, perhaps, 8. trichopsis Wagl. The National Museum pos- 
sesses two young specimens collected by Xantus at Cape St. Lucas, of 
a species allied to but apparently distinct from 8. asio, but adults from 
this region are as yet unknown. Cf. Hist. N. Am. Birds, iii, p. 52. — 
E. E.j 

35. Bubo virginianus sabarcticus (Hoy). 

Horned owls — w^hich were supposed to have been of this species — 
were frequently heard and occasionally seen. 

[A wing, undoubtedly of this race, was among Mr. Belding's speci- 
mens. — E. E.J 

36. Micratheue whitneyi (Cooper.) 

This diminutive owl appeared to be less common here than in the 
cactus region ; however, it was heard at several of our camps. I tried 
more than an hour, one night, to see one which I had brought near me, 
by imitating its cries; but I could not with the advantage of bright 
moonlight and the assistance of opera glasses see the little fellow, 
though he sat in a lone tree not 20 feet from me, and remained in tin's 
particular tree five or ten minutes. Neither myself nor Dr. H. Ten 
Kate, my esteemed companion of two subsequent ascents in the Victoria 
Mountains, was able to get an owl of any sort in all our wanderings 
here and elsewhere in Lower California. In a single instance I think I 
heard a Glaucidium, and again a noise I referred to some unknown 
animal, but the guide said it was a "Tapa Cainino," or Whippoorwill. 

II may have been the notes of Phalamoptilus nuttalli, with which I am 
not acquainted. Have resided in California twenty-seven years, and 
do not think [ have vet heard it.

Abundant and breeding in February. Several nests were seen in 
oak trees, but not closely examined, however, they were so frail, twigs 
alone having- been used in their construction. The eggs could be seen 
by looking through them from below. Their flesh was here excellent, 
notwithstanding they were subsisting principally upon the acorns of 
the deciduous oak [Quercus grisea). 

41. Melopelia leucoptera (Linn.). 
Very common. 

b. Birds of the lowlands (vicinity of La Paz and southward). 

Additional specimens from La Pa: and south of it. 

1. Anthus cervinus (Pall.). (See page 156 of these proceedings.) 

The single specimen was shot at San Jose del Cabo, on the bank of 
an irrigating ditch, February 7, 1883. Finding it in such a locality, at 
first sight I supposed it was a water thrush, as it was alone. 

I was unable afterward to find the species, although I persecuted a 
large flock of A. ludovicianus for several days after shooting it. 

2. Myiodioctes pusillus pileolatus (Pall.). 
Rare, but observed at several localities. 

3. Setophaga ruticilla (Linn.). 

Shot in a dense thicket at Miraflores February 24, 1883. An indi- 
vidual probably seen at La Paz in March following. 

4. Passerculus sandwichensis alaudinus (l>p.) 
Rare. 

[A specimen from San Jose" del Cabo is peculiar in several respects, 
and may be a different species. For the present, however, I place it 
here, pending the examination of more specimens, should any be pro- 
cured.— \l. \l.\

CIFY, PRIONISTIFS HACEEECS. 

By TARLETON H. BEAN, M. D., 

Curator of the Department of Fishes in the United States Xational Museum. 

The United States National Museum has again received from Captain 
Nichols two collections of forty-eight species of fishes, many of which are 
additions to the fauna of Alaska, while one has hitherto been unknown 
to ichthyologists. The Alaskan species are all from the southeastern 
part of the Territory. The following are especially interesting: Trlglops 
pingelii, Qymnacanthus galeatus, Cottopsis gulosus, Sebastiehthys nebulosus, 
Seba8tichthy8 nigrocinctus, Micrometrus aggregatus, and Somniosus micro- 
cephalw, all of which are now for the first time definitely recorded from 
the region under discussion. 

These collections, like all others received from Captain Nichols, are 
in excellent condition, and it is a matter for congratulation that the 
same efficient officer has again visited a region so rich in interest which 
has been so little investigated by collectors. 

The quotations are from the notes accompanying the collection, and 
the numbers in marks of parenthesis are from the inventory of Captain 
Nichols.

PRIONISTIUS new genus, COTTID.E. 

A genus resembling Triglops, from wbicb it differs in numerous im- 
portant particulars, among which are the following: (1) its much 
slenderer form, (2) the absence of a series of bony tubercles along the 
bases of the dorsal fins, (3) the elongation of the exserted pectoral rays 
so that the lower portion of the fin is considerably longer than the 
upper, (4) the presence of serrations on all dorsal spines, and on the 
first soft ray, and (5) the emargination of the caudal fin.

The type of the present species (catalogue number 31958) was ob- 
tained by Captain Nichols in Carter Bay, British Columbia, in August, 



356 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

1882. Its Length to the end of the upper caudal lobe is 172 millimeters; 
to the origin of the middle caudal rays it measures 154 millimeters, 
which length is taken as the unit for comparison with parts of the body. 

Diagnosis : Prionistius macellus differs greatly from Triglops pingelii, 
particularly (1) in its more slender body, (2) in its shorter jaws, (3) iu 
its longer dorsal and anal fins, (4) in its emarginate caudal, (5) in hav- 
ing the uppermost exserted pectoral ray considerably longer than the 
rays above it, (6) in the more advanced position of the ventral fin, 
wijieh is also much shorter than in T. pingelii, (7) in the greater num- 
ber of rays in its dorsal and anal fins. 

These differences are clearly brought out in the table of measure- 
ments accompanying this description. By a very happy coincidence 
Captain Nichols, during the same cruise, obtained an individual of 
Triglops pingelii which is only 8 millimeters longer than the type of P. 
macellus, thus securing the first recorded Alaskan* specimen of T. pin- 
gelii, and at the same time adding an interesting new genus related to 
Triglops. 

Description: The body is slender and elongate; its greatest height 
equals the length of the lower jaw, and is contained 8 times in the unit 
of length. The height at the ventrals equals £ of the distance of the 
pectoral from the tip of the snout, and is contained 8£ times in the 
standard body length. The caudal peduncle is shorter than in T. pin- 
gelii ; its least height equals the width of the interorbital space. The 
length of the caudal peduncle, measured from the end of the anal fin 
to the origin of the middle caudal rays, is contained 7 times in the 
standard total length. There are no bony plates along the dorsal fins. 
The lateral line contains well developed ossoeus tubercles, and beneath 
it are ciliated scales similar to those of T. pingelii ; the breast, however, 
unlike that of the species just named, is naked. 

The head agrees in the main with that of T. pingelii, but is not so 
deep nor so wide; the jaws are about equal iu front. The greatest 
length of the head is contained 4£ times in the unit of length; its great- 
est width is slightly more than h its length, and is contained lh times 
iu the standard body length. The width of the interorbital area, meas- 
ured on the bone, is nearly } of the long diameter of the orbit, which 
equals the snout in length. On the top of the head, close behind the 
orbits, are two short, interrupted furrows similar to those observed in 
some species of Prionotus. The length of the upper jaw is contained 
2£ times in that of the head, equals that of the postorbital part of the 
head, and is contained 9.} times iu the unit of length. The maxillary 
extends nearly to the vertical through the middle of the eye, the man- 
dible nearly to that through the posterior margin of the eye. The 
length of the mandible is about £ that of the head. The dentition is 
the same as in T. pingelii. The length of the eye equals that of the 
snout, and is contained 3$ times in the length of the head. The braneh- 
iostegal nmmbrane is not very deeply emarginate, and is free from the

isthmus. The slit behind the fourth gill is a little more than half as 
long as the pupil. The gill rakers on the anterior arch are quite rudi- 
mentary, their length being rather less than their width ; there are 8 
below the angle. 

The distance of the spinous dorsal from the tip of the snout equals that 
of the pectoral from the same point and is contained 4£ times in the 
standard body length ; the base of this fin is twice as long as the long- 
est ray of the soft dorsal. The length of the first spine equals that of 
the first ray of the soft dorsal and is contained 3£ times in that of the 
head. The fourth spine is the longest, its length being contained 2i 
times in that of the head. The last spine is very little more than £ as 
long as the first. The first line is serrated along the lower third of 
its anterior edge, and all the following spines except the last are simi- 
larly armed along the anterior edge of their exserted tips. Even the 
first ray of the second dorsal is thickly set with minute spines. 

The length of the base of the soft dorsal is contained 2i times in 
the standard body length (or unit of length). Its first ray equals in 
length the longest anal ray ; it is also as long as the first spine and as 
the distance from the snout to the orbit. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and 
seventh rays are the longest and about equal in length ; they are twice 
as long as the last ray and one-fifth as long as the soft dorsal base. 
The membrane behind the last dorsal spine extends to the base of the 
first soft ray. The origin of the anal fin is vertically beneath the base 
of the second soft ray. The distance of the anal origin from the snout 
is less than the length of the anal base. The length of the first anal 
ray equals the least height of the tail and is slightly more than £ that 
of the fifth to the eighth, which are the longest. The last ray is £ as 
long as the orbit. The vent is nearly midway between the origin of the 
ventrals and that of the anal. 

The caudal is distinctly emarginate when fully expauded. The length 
of the middle rays is contained times, and that of the external rays 
7^0 times in the unit of length. 

The structure of the pectoral is similar to that in T. pingelii, but the 
longest of the exserted lower rays extends eonsiderably farther back 
than the upper portion of the fin. The origin of the pectoral is directly 
under that of the spinous dorsal. The length of the longest exserted 
ray (11th) is contained 4J times in the standard body length. Five of 
the lower pectoral rays are modified. The tenth pectoral ray, which is 
the longest of the non exserted portion, is ouly about f as long as the 
eleventh and extends to near the end of the spinous dorsal. 

The ventral is situated farther in advance than in T. pingelii, and 
does not quite reach to the vent when extended. Its length is con- 
tained nearly 12 times in the unit of length.

back and sides of T. pingelii, but the dorsal portion of the markings is 
very faint and the lower limits of the dark areas are the most intense 
and form a succession of elongate blotches along the median line of the 
body, partly below and partly on the lateral line. Dorsal fins with 3 
series of dark spots on the rays and spines, but not on the connecting 
membrane ; these spots forming broken bands which are oblique on the 
first dorsal and nearly horizontal on the soft dorsal when the fins are 
raised. A crescent-shaped broken band crosses the top of the body at 
the ninth dorsal spine. A short, dark blotch near the root of the pec- 
toral on the 10th, 11th, and 12th rays. Another dusky blotch in the 
upper axil of the pectoral. Four dusky bars on the pectoral, the first 
of which is very short, involving only about five of the rays, the 2d and 
3d extending to the first exserted ray, and the 4th, which is near the tip 
of the fin, extending on the 7 upper rays only. Caudal dusky at base 
and with 4 bars, the first of which is faint in the middle and the last 
interrupted by the emargination of the fin. Lips and upper portion of 
maxilla dusky. A dark blotch on the interoperculum. Membrane 
lining the inner surface of the operculum dusky. Ventrals and anal 
whitish.

NOTES ON SOME FISHES COLLECTED BY JAMES G. SWAN IN 
WASHINGTON TERRITORY, INCLUDING A MEW SPECIES OF 

MACRIBIS. 

By TARLETON II. BEAN, BE. 1>.. 

Curator of the Department of Fishes in the United States Xational Museum. 

The following notes on one of the recent collections received from 
Mr. Swan were nearly finished two months ago, but other duties in- 
terrupted their completion until now. Eleven species are mentioned, 
one of which is described as new to science. Another (Delolepis virga- 
tus) was previously unknown so far south, and a third (Brama rail) 
was only recently brought to notice by Mr. Swan as an inhabitant of 
the coast of his territory and waters northward to Vancouver Island. 
1. Macururus acrolepis, new species. 

The credit of discovering the first species of Macrurus known to 
occur on the Pacific coast of the United States is due to Mr. Swan, who 
is well aware that even a mutilated fish is not to be thrown away until 
its identity is fully established. The type of the present description was 
rescued by Mr. Swan from the stomach of a seal ; its catalogue number 
is 32496 ; its length, G35 millimeters ; a small portion of the tail is want- 
ing, and the belly is almost wholly digested. There is no difficulty, 
however, in making out the characters which distinguish this species 
from all others known to me. 

Description.— The shape of the body does not differ materially from 
that of M. fabricii. The height at origin of ventral is contained 7 
times in extreme length ; at origin of anal the body height is contained 
9£ times in extreme length. There are about 7 or 8 rows of scales be- 
tween the lateral line and the base of the first dorsal. 

The length of the head is contained 4i times in extreme length ; its 
greatest height is little more than one-half its length, and is contained 
8 times in total length. The greatest width of the head equals three- 
fourths of its greatest height. The width of the interorbital area equals 
one-half the length of the lower jaw, or three-fourths of the diameter of 
the orbit. The snout is moderately long and pointed, its length being 
about one-fourth that of the head. The length of the upper jaw is a 
little more than one-third of that of the head, and is contained 12i 
times in extreme length. The length of the lower jaw equals the width 
of the head and twice the interorbital distance. The distance from the 
tip of the snout to the orbit equals the length of the orbit. 

The first dorsal is constructed after the usual form, consisting of a 
minute first ray, followed by a long ray serrated along its anterior mar- 
gin, and by additional rays which diminish in size rapidly. The dis- 
tance of this dorsal from the snout equals 3 times the length of the upper 
jaw; the length of its base equals the length of the orbit. The second

ray is imperfect; the portion now present is about as long as the lower 
jaw. 

The second dorsal is separated from the end of the first by a short 
space equal to only one-third the length of the snont and three-tenths 
the length of the base of first dorsal. Its first ray is quite short, only 
one-third as long as the longest, which is about one-third as long as the 
orbit. 

The distance of the anal from the snout is contained 2£ times in ex- 
treme length. That which is apparently the first ray is nearly as long 
as the snout, while the longest ray is nearly as long as the orbit. 

The distance of the pectoral from the snout is slightly greater than 
the length of the head. The length of the pectoral is nearly one-half 
that of the head. 

The distance of the ventral origin from the snout is contained 5 times 
in extreme length; the length of the ventral is about one-eighth of ex- 
treme length and equals twice that of the longest anal ray.

NOTES OIV FISHES OBSERVED AT THE HEAD OF CHESAPEAKE BAT 
I \ THE SPRING OF 1 889 ; AND UPOiV OTHER SPECIES OF THE 8AJHK 

REGION. 

By TABLETON H. BEAN, M. !>.. 

Curator of the Department of Fishes in the United States National Museum. 

Early in June, 1882, the writer made a short visit to the station of the 
United States Fish Commission near Havre de Grace, Maryland, while 
the work of hatching eggs of the shad and other economic fishes was in 
progress. An immense seine was in use here by the Commission, and 
in it were captured most of the species which are the subjects of the 
present brief sketch. Information concerning species not seen by me, 
but perfectly well known to persons employed at the station, and taken 
in the seine previous to the time of my visit, or by some other means of 
capture, was furnished by one of the most experienced of the fishermen, 
and is here reproduced. The species marked by an asterisk were taken- 
June and 10 and examined after they reached the Museum, where they 
are now preserved. The common names given are in use at Havre de 
Grace. 

1. Achirus lineatus (L. ) Cut. Hoachoke. 

2. Liostomus xanthurus Lac Spot. 

The " spot" is said to occur only in very dry seasons. 

3. Lepomis auritus (L.) Raf. Sun-fish. 

Said to be present throughout the year. 

4. * Lepomis gibbosus (L.) McKay. Moccasin. 
Said to be present all the year. 

5. Micropterus dolomiei Lac. Black Bass. 

6. * Perca americana Schrauck. Yellorv Perch ; Ring Perch ; Yellow Ned. 

In February yellow perch come into the creeks to spawn ; the spawn- 
ing season ends in March, when the fish go out to the flats. They re- 
main in the vicinity all the year. The maximum weight here is about 
2 pounds. 

7. Stizostedium vitreum (Mitch.) Jor. &, Copel'd. Salmon Trout : Salmon. 

This species is highly esteemed in the Susquehanna. In the year 
1862 or 1863 an individual weighing 8 pounds was sold at Bainbridge, 
Pennsylvania, for $2. 

8. Roccus saxatilis (Bl. Schn.) Jor. & Gill). Rock. 
Eock-fish are said to be present from April to October, and to be 

most abundant in August and September on the flats in the celery 
grass. They are always plentiful, occurring in hundreds of thousands. 
They will live in " live cars," and a great many are so kept now. The 
species reaches a length of 4 feet and sometimes weighs 60 pounds. 



366 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

9. * Roccus americanus (Gmel.) Jor. & Gilb. White Perch. 

This fish is found from April to October, and is gravid in May and 
June Ir is most plentiful in August and September. 

10. Pomatomus saltatrix (L.) Gill. Tailor. 

In very dry seasons .small examples of this species are found here. 

11. *Tylosurus marinus (Bl. Schn.) Jor. & Gill). Silver Oar. 

The silver gar makes its appearance in April. A gravid female was 
seen June 9. 

12. * Esox reticulatus Le Sueur. Pickerel. 

The species is said to remain throughout the year. 

13. Fuudulus diaphanus (Le S.) Agassiz. 

14. Brevoortia tyrannus (Latrobe) Goode. Bug-fish; Alewife. 
The species occurs here only in very dry seasons. 

15. * Clupea sapidissima Wilson. Shad. 

Shad measuring 4i inches in length were seined June 10. It is said 
that quantities of the young about 4 inches long were seen in 1882 with 
the adults. The species appears in April and spawns on the flats. Shad 
have been caught plentifully in July; on the 3d of the month, one year, 
a man caught 44 in a gill-net in the swash just below the lightdiouse. 
The shad has until recently been considered one of the weakest of fishes, 
and it was astonishing to see the treatment which it survived at Bat- 
tery station ; examples were taken from the seine, carried several steps 
to the pool in dip-nets, afterward seined out of the pool and pressed to 
see if the eggs were mature, and then returned to the pool, where they 
seemed to suffer no injury from the handling they had received. Some- 
times, in taking shad from the gill-nets, lampreys, presumably the young 
of Petromyzon marinus, are hauled in fastened to the side of the fish. 

16. Clupea vemalis Mitchill. Branch Herring. 

The branch alewife first appears in February. It comes along shore 
and runs up all the small streams ; it spawns in the creek, and departs 
in May. Plenty of young alewives 2.\ to 3 inches long are seen in the 
creek in May. On the 10th of June a young branch alewife 4^ inches 
long was caught in the i>ool with a dip-net. Many of the young were 
seen in this inclosure. 

17. *Clupea aestivalis Mitchill. (llui Herring. 

These appear late in April, coming up through the deepest water. 
They spawn on the fiats and go up the river, departing in June. A 
small number were caught in the large seine June 0. 

18. * Clupea mediocris Mitchill. Hickory Shad; Hickory Jack. 

This species comes early in March; it spawns in the creek, with the 
branch alewife, on gravel and rocks, well out of the tide. It leaves in 
May. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 367 

19. Dorosoma cepedianum (Le S.) Gill. Mud Shad. 

The mud shad is a. permanent resident, but it is said to be rare. 

20. *Carpiodes cyprinus (Le S.) Agassiz. Carp Sucker. 

This handsome sucker is considered a pretty good food -fish, and is 
often supposed to be the German carp (Cyprinus carpio.) It is com- 
paratively abundant. 

21. * Catostomus teres (Mitch.) Le S. Black Mullet. 

This species arrives in February, spawns in creeks on gravel and rock 
bottom until March, and departs in May or June. It reaches 18 inches 
in length and 3 pounds in weight. 

22. Catostomus nigricans Le Sueur. Horn Mullet ; Stone-roller. 

23. * Moxostoma macrolepidotum (Le S.) Jor. Bay Mullet. 

24. * Sernotilus bullaris (Raf. ) Jor. Fall-fish; Chub. 

25. Notemigonus chrysoleucus (Mitch.) Jor. Roach. 

This is said to be present all the year. 

26. * Amiurus catus (L.) Gill. Cat. 

27. * Amiurus albidus (Le S.) Jor. White Cat. 

28. * Anguilla rostrata (Le S.) De Kay. Eel. 

The eel is a permanent resident. It is very destructive to spawning 
shad when these are caught in gill-nets, often completely disemboweling 
the fish before they can be taken from the nets. 

A very effective trap for the capture of eels is in use at Havre de 
Grace. It consists of a keg or barrel with gunny sack at one or both 
ends. In one end there is a funnel made of a stocking leg, or any thing 
of a similar form that may be at hand, and this is fastened to the oppo- 
site eud by four cords. Auger-holes are bored in the staves. Bricks 
or stones are placed inside to sink the trap. A line is attached for the 
purpose of lowering the contrivance, and to this a buoy is fastened to 
mark the place of setting. A small trap-door is made in the top of the 
keg to put in bait and remove the eels. Fish entrails and heads or stale 
fish are used for bait. 

29. Lepidosteus osseus (L.) Agasaiz. Green Gar. 
This gar comes in May and is not plentiful. 

30. Acipenser oxyrhynchus Mitchill. 

A sturgeon which I suppose to be this species is common at Havre 
de Grace, coming in June or July, running into creeks, and leaving in 
September. 

31. Petromyzon marinus L. Sea Lamprey ; Shad Lamprey. 

The sea lamprey comes up into the river to spawn about the time 
shad appear. The young of this species is apparently the "shad lam- 
prey " of the fishermen.

CAN ."*i'i:cii:s. 
By ROBERT RIDGWAY. 

A very tine collection of Japanese birds, made for the United States 
National Museum by Mr. Pierre Louis Jouy, includes several species 
of more or less interest to students of North American ornithology, on 
account of their relationship to species belonging to our fauna. The very 
complete series of specimens enables me in each case to make a satis- 
factory comparison of the representative species. 

1. Anthus japonicus Temm. & Schleg. 

This is so much like our A. ludovicianus that their distinctness might 
almost be questioned. Comparing specimens No. 91468, 9 ad., Yoka- 
hama, Japan (Jan. 3, 1883), and No. 90644, S ad., New Orleans, La. (Dec. 
13, 1882), the difference in coloration is microscopic — far less, in fact, than 
between many American examples from the same locality and of same 
date of capture. The only tangible difference is the darker feet of the 
Louisiana specimen, in which the toes are nearly black and the tarsi a 
very dark horn-color, while in the Japanese specimen the tarsi are 
clear horn-color, the toes slightly darker. In measurement they com- 
pare as follows :

The shades of coloration, as well as the pattern, are identical to the 
minutest degree, as is also the form of the bill and the proportions of 
the primaries. Moreover, three other specimens from New Orleans 
agree closely in coloration with No. 90644, and are much more like 
Japanese specimens than any others in a series of more than 50 North 
American examples, except in the color of the legs and feet, which in all 
North American specimens examined are nearly black, whereas those of 
Japanese examples are decidedly brown, or horn-colored. 

In the National Museum series of A. ludovicianus, which embraces 
specimens from all parts of the continent, decided variations are notice- 
able, which, however, appear to be only in part correlative with differ- 
ence of locality. Thus, most winter specimens from the Atlantic States 
(New England to District of Columbia, at least) are decidedly brown 
above and tawny buff beneath; the pectoral markings are broad and 
distinct, and sometimes, (though not usually) as dark colored (nearly 
black) as in A. japonicus. With these, Alaskan specimens obtained in 
August and September agree strictly. Many western specimens in win- 
ter plumage (Idler from Atlantic roast examples in paler lower parts

■with narrower streaks on the breast ; but the difference is not great, 
except in extreme cases, and by no means constant. As to summer 
specimens (i. e., those in breeding dress), I am unable to distinguish 
differences between certain skins from Labrador, Colorado, and Alaska; 
but I have been able to examine a comparatively small number of speci- 
mens. Possibly a large series of specimens in breeding plumage from the 
proper localities (say Labrador, Alaska, the Eocky Mountains, and the 
Sierra Nevada) might exhibit differences upon which two or more geo- 
graphical races could be based, but, with present facilities, I find the 
attempt to define differences sufficiently characteristic of region quite 
hopeless. 

It is possible that in its breeding plumage, which I have not seen, 
A.japonicus may be quite distinct from A. ludovicianus, but the four 
winter specimens examined appear to differ only, so far as constant 
characters are concerned, in the paler color of the legs and feet. 

In Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 6, p. 95, I have with much doubt re- 
ferred to this species six examples of an Anthus obtained by Dr. L. 
Stejneger on Bering and Copper Islands, Kamtschatka, but being not 
at all satisfied that they were thus correctly determined, I proposed 
the name stejnegeri in view of their probable distinctness. I now find 
that they do not at all resemble A.japonicus, but are much more like 
A. arboreus, A. spraguei, and other species having the upper parts con- 
spicuously variegated. They seem to come near A. gustavi Swinh., 
which Mr. Seebohm says (Ibis, 1878, p. 342) occurs on Bering Island; 
but I cannot reconcile certain marked discrepancies between the only 
description which I have been able to consult (the original one by 
Swinh oe, in Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1863, p. 90) and the characters 
presented by the series before me. I therefore incline to the opinion 
that while the species may be A. gustavi, it seems more likely to be dif- 
ferent, and probably new. 
2. Regulus japonicus. 

This kinglet is a very near relative of R. satrapa and R. cristatus, but 
is sufficiently distinct. The principal differences from the former con- 
sist (1) in the absence of the black bar across the forehead, immediately 
in front of the colored crown-patch, the whole forehead being smoky 
gray, paler toward the bill; (2) narrower black stripes on side of crown; 
(3) absence of the whitish superciliary stripe, only the orbits being 
whitish; (4) absence of the dusky streak through the eye, and (5) much 
more olivaceous sides and flanks. In all these characters it agrees with 
H. cristatus; but from the latter it differs (as does also R. satrapa) in gray- 
ish nape and side of hinder head, and in some other minor features. 
Upon the whole it is most nearly related to the European species, though 
the coloration of the nape, back, and rump is precisely that of the

American bird. The white terminal spots of the tertials are much larger 
than in either of its allies, being, in fact, a very conspicuous and char- 
acteristic feature. 
3. Anorthura fumigata (Temm.). 

In the Ibis for January, 187o (pp. 143, 144), the late Mr. Robert Swinhoe 
suggested the identity of this species with A. alascensis Baird, his rea- 
sons for this determination being given as follows : 

" With reference to the birds of Hakodadi, a suspicion crossed my 
mind that possibly I had made a mistake in identifying the Wren from 
Hakodadi with the Troglodytes fumigatus, Temm., of Nagasaki, and that 
while the latter might be the Wren of Southern Japan, the northern 
bird might be distinct, and identical with T. alascensis, Baird. To clear 
the doubt I sent a skin to Dr. G. Schlegel, and begged him to get me 
in exchange from his father, of the Leyden Museum, a specimen of gen- 
uine 1. fumigatus. His reply I have unfortunately mislaid; but it was 
to the purport that the museum had no duplicate to spare, but that my 
bird, which he and his father had carefully compared with the type 
specimen, was identically the same. We must therefore conclude that 
T. alascensis, Baird, is a synonym of T. fumigatus, Temm." 

As many authors have adopted without question Mr. Swiuhoe's erro- 
neous determination, I give below average measurements of an equal 
number of adult males of the two species, and also, for sake of compari- 
son, those of the same number of specimens of A. troglodytes, A. hyema- 
lis, and A. hyemalis pacijica.

In coloration, A. fumigata comes much nearer the Pacific coast race 
of A. hyemalis (A. hyemalis pacijica) than any of the other species with 
which it has been compared ; but the lower parts are much less tawny 
(though equally dark), and with the dark bars and lighter specks ex- 
tending further forward. The sides of the neck are also quite conspic- 
uously streaked with whitish or pale brownish. 

4. Certhia familiaris. 

A specimen from Sapporo is snowy white beneath ; the ground-color 
above is nearly hidden by the unusually broad pale longitudinal mark- 
ings. Another from Tate-Tama is very tawny above, and hardly dis- 
tinguishable from some German examples. The bill, however, is un- 
usually small and but little curved, the culmen measuring only .45 of 
an inch. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 371 

5. Ampelis phoenicopterum. 

This lovely bird is much more nearly related to A. garrulus than to 
A. cedrorum, having, like the former, a very long crest, black throat, 
cinnamon-rufous forehead and cheeks, and rufous eiissum ; the latter, 
however, is stained, more or less, with blood-red. It also agrees more 
nearly with A. garrulus in size, and like that species has the outer web 
(sometimes inner web also) of the primaries tipped with white. The 
tip of the tail, however, instead of being yellow, as in the two American 
species, is of an exquisite rose-red color, and the greater wing-coverts are, 
for their exposed portion, dark purplish red. What is most remarka- 
ble, however, is that neither sex possesses the wax like appendages to 
the shafts of the secondaries that are so characteristic of both A. gar- 
rulus and A. cedrorum, although in occasional specimens (as No. 91596, 
$ ad.) they are developed to a very minute degree on the two inner- 
most feathers. In perfect plumage, the outer webs of the secondaries 
are tipped with a narrow crescentic bar of pure rose-rtd ; the outer webs 
of the primaries are tipped with clear rose-pink (or " pink madder "), 
and the inner webs tipped, transversely, with white. In four out of 
five specimens sent, however, there is no white at all on the inner webs 
of the primaries, while the outer web of each has a longitudinal bar of 
pure white. In a male and a female the red spots are wanting on the 
secondaries, which are concolored throughout ; but in two others, both 
males, the secondaries have the red spots, very small in one, well de- 
veloped in the other. 

6. Leucosticte brunneonucha. 

The series includes ten specimens, all in winter plumage, and with 
yellow bills. Of one, the sex is not determined ; but of the others, three 
are males and six are females. Of the latter, two are quite as brightly 
colored as the brightest male, while the third is very nearly equal in rich- 
ness of coloration to the dullest of the three males. The other three 
females, however, are very much duller colored, and are probably young 
birds in their first winter. 

7. -ffigiothus linaria. 

There are three specimens, two of them from Sapporo, being cage 
birds, the third a wild bird from Tate-Yama. They are decidedly refer- 
able to linaria as distinguished (by me) from exilipes, but look a little 
different from North American specimens, and may, on comparison, 
prove to belong to a distinct race. 

8. Loxia albiventris. 

This Crossbill is more like L. curvirostra. of Europe, than the Amer- 
ican species, or race (L. americana).

OIV A COLLECTION OF iCDKDS FKOM NIt'ARACSIA 

By CHARLES C. MUTTINIG. 
Edited by K. Ridgway.' 

In the early part of 1883, the writer visited Nicaragua for the purpose 
of making a collection of birds for the Smithsonian Institution. 

In order to procure as large a representation of Nicaragua birds as 
possible, four regions were visited. The first of these, San Juan del 
Sur, is situated on the Pacific coast; the second, Sucuya, on the west 
shore of Lake Nicaragua; the third, Ometepe,t is an island in the lake; 
and the fourth, Los Sabalos, is on the river San Juan del Norte, about 
30 miles from the east shore of the lake. 

It will be seen that these four stations form a chain across the greater 
part of Nicaragua, reaching from west to east. In order to present 
more forcibly the difference in the avifauna; of these regions, induced 
by the marked difference in the physical characteristics of the four 
stations, a separate list of species will be given for each region visited. 

I. — San Juan del Sue,. 

On the 4th of January, 1883, the writer landed in San Juan del Sur, 
on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, a few miles north of the Costa Kican 
boundary. 

The port is situated in a beautiful harbor surrounded by low mount- 
ains, and is said to be the healthiest port on the Pacific coast of Central 
America. A small river empties into the bay, and the banks of this 
stream are the favorite resort of numerous species of water birds. 

A dense growth of small, thorny trees situated between the river and 
the town of San Juan affords a good field for collecting many kinds of 
small birds, while in a dense marshy forest beyond the river many larger 
and more wary species are to be found. 

The avifauna is not nearly so rich here as in the other localities which 
I visited, the water birds being the only ones found in unusual abun- 
dance. Several species of this class were observed, but not secured, the 
writer deeming it best to devote his time to families more likely to pro- 
duce novelties. 

All species marked with an asterisk are for the first time recorded 
from Nicaragua. 

"The. editor of this paper is responsible for the nomenclature adopted and all crit- 
ical remarks. 

1 1 have adopted this spelliug of the word Ometepc, from the fact that it is the one 
used by the natives of the country. I have in my possession an official paper in 
which the word occurs several times and is spelled in this way. I notice also that 
Captain J. M. Dow, of Panama, and Dr. Earl Flint, of Rivas, both use the same spell- 
in"-. While the original Indian name was doubtless Ometepec, I prefer to spell it in 
accordance with the usage of the country. — C. N. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 373- 
Fam. SYLVIIDJ3. 

*1. Polioptila albiloris Salv. 

Common, especially in the thicket south of the river. These dimin- 
utive birds are extremely familiar and fearless, approaching within two> 
or three feet of the collector, without seeming to notice his presence, in 
their busy search for the various insects which constitute their food. In 
their manner of climbing about trees and bushes they remind one of our 
Black-capped Titmouse {Parus atricapillas). 

Five specimens secured. 

Fam. TROGLODYTID^E. 

*2. Campylorhynchus capistratus (Less.). 

Common, but not so abundant as I found it on the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa 
Kica. Found generally in the more open country, especially along the 
"pinuella" hedges, in which they often construct their nests. 

Song very voluble, both male and female often joining in a lively duet, 
which fills the air with melody. Two specimens. 

3.Thryophilus : pleurostictus Scl. 
Abundant. Four specimens. 

Fam. MNIOTILTID^. 

4. Siurus naevius (Bodd.). 

Apparently not common. The single specimen secured was shot in 
the deep, swampy forest across the river. A diligent search on several 
occasions failed to discover other specimens. 

5. Dendraeca aestiva (Gm.). 

Common. For some reason, inexplicable to me, this warbler was ex- 
ceedingly shy and difficult to approach, much more so than in Costa 
Rica, or the other localities visited in Nicaragua. Two specimens se- 
cured. 
*6. Myiodioctes pusillus (Wils.). 

Seen, but not secured. 

Fam. TANAGRID^E. 

•7. Euphonia humilis (Cab.). 

Not common. The single specimen secured was shot out of the top 
of a large tree. Song exceedingly voluble and melodious, perhaps the 
most pleasing that I heard in this region. 

Fam. FRINGILLID^E. 

*8. Cyanospiza cyanea (Linn.). 

One specimen shot in open field up the river. 



374 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Fam. CORVIDJE. 

*9. Calocitta formosa (Sw.). 

This elegant jay is quite common around San Juan. I noticed that 
the natives here, as in Costa Rica, ascribe to it the power of speaking, 
although I never saw one which had acquired that accomplishment. 

Fam. TYRANNID^E. 

10. Myiozetetes texensis (Giraud). 

Abundant. Apparently gregarious, being almost always found in 
small flocks. A lively and interesting bird, sure to attract the attention 
of the collector by its bright color, activity, and peculiar cries. The 
latter I can compare to nothing but the cry of a little chicken in distress. 
It is found both in the woods and more open country, seeming to prefer 
isolated trees in the vicinity of water. 

Three specimens secured. 

* 11. Rhynchocyclus cinereiceps Scl. 

Iris white. Only one specimen. 

*12. Pitangus derbianus Kaup. 

Abundant. One of the most conspicuous birds of the region. It is 
most frequently seen on the margin of the water perching on some low 
branch awaiting its insect prey. Its cry is extremely harsh and monot- 
onous, proving an annoyance to one listening for the notes of other 
birds. It is, moreover, of a decidedly quarrelsome disposition, even 
more so than the rest of its family. Two specimens. 

13. Megarhynchus pitangua (Linn.). 

Not so common as the last. Habits much the same, but it does not 
show such a marked preference for the vicinity of the water. 
Two specimens secured. 

* 14. Myiarchus nuttingi Ridgw. 

Common, but rather solitary in its habits. It is usually seen sitting 
quietly on a low limb in the thick woods. It is quieter than many of 
its kind. 

Three specimens. 

15. Tyrannus melancholicus satrapa (Licht.). 
Apparently rare. One specimen secured. 

16. Milvulus forficatus (Gm.). 

This graceful Flycatcher is more abundant in the vicinity of San 
Juan than in any other region in which I have collected. 

It is gregarious in its habits, being usually found in flocks of from six 
to ten. It is much more silent than is usual among the Flycatchers, 
and more timid and difficult to approach than any that I can think of. 

I had ample opportunity to observe this bird, and was struck with 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 375 

the fact that it never seemed to associate with any other member of its 
family, although all the other common species seemed to mix indis- 
criminately. This latter fact may, however, be due to a community of 
interests. 

The peculiar scissor-like motion ot the long tail-feathers, from which 
this bird derives its vernacular name, is always seen during a flight of 
any length. 

All the specimens obtained were shot from trees bordering the shore 
of the bay, and they do not seem to penetrate into the forest to any 
great extent. Five specimens. 

17. Milvulus tyrannus (Linn.). 

One day while collecting up the river a bird flew over which I took to 
be this species, principally from the fact that there was no motion of 
the tail-feathers. 

Fam. DENDBOCOLAPTLDiE. 

*18. Dendrornis eburneirostris (Less.). 

One specimen shot near the river. Noticed a marked absence of 
birds of this family, although the woods in many places seemed well 
suited to their pursuits. 

Fam. TEOCHILIDiE. 

# 19. Chlorostilbon osberti Gould. 
One specimen. 

Fam. CAPEIMULGID^J. 

* 20. Antrostomus carolinensis (Gm.). 

Common. Two specimens secured. 
*21. Nyctidromus albicollis (Gm.). 

Seen, but not secured. 

Fam. PICID^E. 

*22. Centurus aurifrons hoffmanni (Cab.). 

Abundant. The common Woodpecker of the region. 

23. Ceryle torquata (Linn.). 

Common, especially in the swampy country across the river. Noisy 
and active, like all its American relatives. One specimen. 

*24. Ceryle alcyon (Linn.). 

Not common. The only one that I saw was shot in the swamp men- 
tioned above. 

25. Ceryle americana cabanisi (Tsclmdi). 
Common along the river. 



376 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Fam. TPtOGONID^E. 

26. Trogon melanocephalus Gould. 

Probably common, although I secured only one specimen. The dif- 
ference of avifaunae of regions only a few miles apart is a fact continu- 
ally forcing itself upon the notice of the explorer in the tropics. San 
Juan del Sur, for example, is not more than 40 or 50 miles from "La 
Palma," Costa Rica, and they are both on the Pacific coast. At the 
latter point I found three species of Trogon very abundant, i. e., T. me- 
lanocephalus, T. massena, and T. caligatus. At San Juan del Sur a dili- 
gent search failed to discover a single specimen of the last two species, 
and only one of the first was taken. 

Iris brown. Bare orbital region sky-blue. 

Fam. CUCULIDJE. 

27. Crotophaga sulcirostris Sw. 

Abundant. Delights in hedge-rows and feeds largely upon the worst 
enemy of the collector, the "garrapata" or tick. One specimen. 

"28. Diplopterus naevius (Gm.). 

One specimen shot out of a hedge in an open field. Appears to be 
terrestrial in its habits. 

29. Piaya cay ana mehleri (Bp.). 

Common. The loud mournful cry of this bird is frequently heard 
around San Juan. 

It is graceful in its movements and is conspicuous both for its cry and 
the peculiar and constant flirting of its long tail. Strictly .arboreal. 
Iris deep red. Skin exceedingly tender. Three specimens. 

"30. Coccyzus seniculus (Lath.). 

Not rare. Is less shy than any other member of its familj* with which 
I am acquainted. Arboreal. Never heard its note. 

Fam. PSITTACID^E. 

*31. Ara macao (Linn.). 

Common, but not nearly so abundant as in other parts of the country. 
None secured. 

*32. Chrysotis albifrons (Sparm.). 

Abundant. Iris very pale yellow. Bill lemon yellow. 

This beautiful parrot is much sought after by the natives on account 
of its bright plumage, and has been made quite shy by continual per- 
secution. So much is this the case that I found it difficult, at first, to 
secure specimens, and finally succeeded by a method almost inexcusable 
from its cruelty. 

Having succeeded in wounding one, I took advantage of its piercing 
screams of distress, not dispatching it at once, as humanity dictated, 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 377 

but allowing it to continue its cries and attract its numerous com- 
panions. They came fairly swarming around the spot, and I secured 
all I needed. 
*33. Chryaotia auripalliata (Less.). 

Saw a pair of these domesticated at San Juan del Sur. They are 
remarkably good talkers. 

*34. Brotogerys tovi (Gm.). 
Exceedingly abundant. 

Fam. FALCONID^J. 

*35. Pandion halieetus carolinensis (Gm.). 

Seen, but not secured. 
" 36. Aaturina plagiata (Schl.). 

Common. Quite fearless. Has a loud, clear cry. 

Two specimens. Cere and legs yellow. Iris brown. 

•37. Rupornia ruficauda (Scl. & Salv.). 

Abundant. 
*38. Buteo borealis costaricensis Ridgw. 

I was informed by an English resident that this bird is not uncommon 
in the region. 

39. Urubitinga anthracina (Nitzsch.). 

Common and fearless. 
"40. Micraster melanoleucus (Vieill.). 

Rather rare. One specimen. Iris brown, legs lemon yellow. 
41. Tinnunculus sparverius (Linn.). 

Common. 
*42. Harpagus fasciatua Lawr. 

Not common. The single specimen secured was brought to me alive 
by the natives. I put him in a cage with the intention of trying to 
tame him, but he absolutely refused to eat or drink, and savagely at- 
tacked my hand whenever I tried to feed him. The color of the iris is 
different from any other that I know of and lends a peculiar beauty to 
the bird in life. Iris brownish pink. Cere and eyelids greenish. Legs 
brownish. 
*43. Folyborua cheriway (Jacq. ). 

Very abundant. Associates with the buzzards and is fully as offen- 
sive to the smell. In encounters between the buzzards and the Cara- 
cara the latter is generally worsted. 

None secured. 

Fam. CATHARTID^}. 

*44. Carthartea aura (Linn.). 
Extremely abundant. 



378 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 
*45. Catharista atrata (Bartr.). 

Not so common as the last. 

*46. Gyparchus papa (Linn.). 

Bare. Only one seen. 

fam. columbhxei. 

*47. Melopelia leucoptera (Linn.). 

Common. The note of this bird is uncommonly musical and varied 
for one of its family. Circurnorbital region sky-blue. Three specimens. 
*48. Chamaepelia passerina (Linn.). 

Abundant. 
*49. Engyptila verreauxi (Bp.). 

Iris yellow. Circumorbital region sky-blue. 

Fam. TAOHYPETID^. 

*50. Tachypetes aquila (Linn.). 

Native name " Tijeretay One of the specimens shot ejected twenty- 
three small fishes from its pouch. These birds seem to be almost 
always on the wing and are exceedingly graceful in their evolutions, 
moving their long outer rectrices exactly in the same manner as Milvu- 
lus forficatus. They never appear to dive for their food, but skillfully 
pick up the fish from near the surface of the water, or pounce upon 
those left ashore by the receding waves. Two specimens. Iris brown. 
Gular pouch light red. 

Fam. PELECANID^E. 

*51. Pelecanus fuscus Linn. 
Abundant. Always to be seen diving for fish along the sea-coast.

II. — SUCUYA. 

The hacienda "Sucuya," is about 22 miles northwest of San Juan 
del Sur, and about 4 miles north of Rivas, a town of considerable size. 
This hacienda is quite extensive and stretches for several miles along 
the west shore of Lake Nicaragua, or rather along a great lagoon which 
is an arm of the lake. The surrounding country is low, and to the east 
and north exceedingly thickly wooded and swampy. Tnis shore of the 
lake might fitly be called the garden spot of Nicaragua, and, perhaps, 
of Central America. It supports an exceedingly dense population, 
and agriculture, together with stock-raising, is the main, almost the 
sole, support of the people. 

The avifauna of this region is much richer than in San Juan del Sur. 
Families not at all, or very meagerly, represented in San Juan, become 
quite abundant at Sucuya. As the most prominent examples of this 
fact, I would mention the Tanagridte, Cotingidtt, Dendrocolaptidce, Forml- 
cariida, and Momotidce. The forest in Sucuya is denser and more tropical 
in appearance than at San Juan, and insect life is much more varied 
and troublesome to the collector. Scorpions, ants, mosquitoes, and 
"garapatas" are unrelaxing in their efforts to turn the attention of the 
naturalist from other and pleasanter pursuits. 

"Sucuya" is owned by a company consisting of Sr. Don Juaquin 
Zavala, ex-President of Nicaragua, Sr. Don Ad an Cardenas, Presi- 
dent of Nicaragua, and Sr. Don Narciso Feria, prefect of Rivas. I 
am thus particular in mentioning their names, from the fact that it is to 
them I owe a pleasant home in an excellent collecting ground for a 
month. I am also under great obligation to Sr. Don Alejandro 
Chamberlain, " administrador " of Sucuya, a gentleman who spared 
no effort to make my stay at the hacienda both pleasant and profitable. 
Science has no truer well-wishers than the gentlemen above mentioned. 

Fam. TURDID^E. 

1. Merula grayi (Bp.). 
Common. Three specimens. 

Fam. SYLVIID^E. 

*2. Polioptilabilineata(Bp.). 
Abundant. Seems to replace P. albiloris in this region, at least I did 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 381 

not see any of the latter. Found principally on the edge of a large 
clearing near the swamp. 

Their nests were apparently built among the branches of fallen trees, 
and they appeared to be living in much the same manner as wrens. 

fam. troglodytid^;. 

*3. Campylorhynchus capistratus (Less.). 

Common. This species seems to be confined to the west side of the 
lake. At least I failed to find a single specimen either on the island Oine- 
tepe or the river San Juan del Norte. I consider it one of the most 
pleasing songsters I have met in Central America. A more jolly, rol- 
licking melody would be hard to imagine, and is in perfect keeping with 
the familiar, almost audacious, manner of the bird. 

Three specimens. 

[Note. — The differences between Costa Eican specimens of this species, 
and others from Guatemala and Honduras, alluded to on page 389 of 
volume 5 of these Proceedings, are well borne out in five specimens 
(two from San Juan del Sur and three from Sucuya) collected by Mr. 
Nutting, the Nicaraguan bird agreeing with those from Costa Rica in 
the more variegated back, which in two examples from the above-named 
countries (No. 30654, Savana Grande, Guatemala, O. Salviu, and No. 
42588, Spanish Honduras, Hges and Sauter) have the entire back an 
unbroken rusty chestnut color. The two specimens from San Juan del 
Sur are decidedly larger than the three from Sucuya, and have light 
buff rather than white lower parts ; but these differences may not be 
constant in a larger series. — R. R.] 

4. Thryophilus rufalbus (Lafr.). 

Common, more especially in thick forests. This bird presents a 
marked contrast to the preceding, both in habits and song. Thus, while 
C. capistratus is conspicuous, fearless, and self-asserting, and prefers 
the hedge-rows and edges of the woods, T. rufalbus is retiring, timid, 
and modest in disposition, and is almost invariably found in the deep 
forests. While the note of the former is loud, voluble, and merry, that 
of the latter is low, hesitating, and sad, but wonderfully sweet and 
expressive. 
*5. Thryophilus pleurostictua Scl. 

Abundant. Found principally in the very densest forest. Song 
sweet, but less demonstrative than that of Campylorhynchus capistratus.

Fam. TANAGRID^J. 

*11. Phcenicothraupis rubicoides (Lafr.). 

Abundant. Habits very similar to those of the Dendrocolaptid.ee. 
Gregarious. Usually silent. 

Curiously enough, although a Tanager, this bird is usually seen cling- 
ing to the tree-trunks, like the Dendrocolaptidcu, and hops about the 
ground like the Formicariidcv. Indeed it seemed to be living almost 
entirety upon ants. There were many places where the ground was 
actually swarming with these insects, and there P. rubicoides would 
congregate in large numbers, either picking up the ants from the 
ground, or climbing about the trunks of trees in pursuit of the same 
insect. 

This latter fact is so peculiar for a bird of this family that I would 
not state it, had I not had ample opportunity to convince myself that 
it was not an accidental or rare position for these birds to take, but 
that it was habitual with them while feeding, a fact proven to me by 
scores of instances. 

Found always in the thickest parts of the forest. Four specimens. 

12. Eucometis spodocephala (Bp.). 

Very abundant. Like the last, it was found feeding largely upon 
ants, and lived near the ground. But it did notcliug to the tree-trunks 
like P. rubicoides, and was generally found near the edges of the forest. 
I do not remember its note distinctly, but think it was little more than 
a chirp. Gregarious. Nine specimens. 

*13. Saltator atriceps Less. 

Common. Gregarious. Note loud and rather harsh. Usually found 
along the edge of the forest. Does not seem to feed largely upon ants, 
and spends very little of its time upon the ground. Six specimens.

'17. Cyanospiza ciris (Linn.). 

Abundant. It is a curious fact that, while I saw hundreds of these 
birds every time I went out collecting, and had ample opportunity to 
observe them at close quarters, I did not see a single male C. ciris at 
Sucuya. There were many large flocks composed, apparently, entirely 
of females. I would certainly have seen the gaudily-colored males, had 
there been any considerable number in the region. Six specimens.

Rather common along the hedges. Three specimens. 

Fam. ICTERID^J. 

19. Ostinopsmontezum3e(Less.). 

Abundant. Iris brown. Basal half of bill black, terminal half red. 
Wattles white. Bare spot under eyes light blue. 

The " Oropendola," as this bird is called by the natives, is one of the 
most familiar and conspicuous birds of the region. 

It feeds largely on plantains, bananas, mangoes, and other cultivated 
fruits, thus making itself obnoxious to the inhabitants. 

The "Oropendola" lives in colonies which, in this region, are generally 
located in cocoanut palms. The nests are long and purse-like, and are 
generally composed of fine grasses, the entrance being near the top. 
There are often fifty or more of these nests in a single tree. The birds 
have a curious way of getting into the nests and shaking them violently, 
producing a rattling noise. It would be almost impossible to describe 
the note of this bird, as it is so totally different from any other with 
which I am acquainted. I have sometimes beard a similar noise pro- 
duced by a cart-wheel that needed greasing, but a cart-wheel makes so 
many different noises that the comparison is almost a useless one. Seven 
specimens. 

I am told that forty or fifty years ago there were no Oropendolas in 
this region.

34. Chiroxiphia linearis Bp. 

Abundant. Spanish name "Toledo" (pronounced "Tolay'do") on 
account of a fancied likeness to their whistling note. The natives also 
call this bird " Bailador " or "Dancer." It was not until I had been 
in the region for some time that I understood why it was given this 
name. One day, while hunting through the dense forest, the profound 
silence was suddenly broken by the regularly repeated note of "El 
Bailador," and softly making my way toward the spot whence the 
sound proceeded, I witnessed one of the most remarkable performances 
it has ever been my lot to see. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 385 



Vol. VI, T¥o. 25. Washington, D. C. April 9, 1884. 



Upou a bare twig which overhung the trail at a distance of about 
four feet from the ground, two male "Bailadors" were engaged in a 
44 song and dance" act that simply astounded me. The two birds were 
about a foot and a half apart, and were alternately jumping about two 
feet into the air and alighting exactly upon the spot whence they 
jumped. The time was as regular as clock-work, one bird jumping up 
the instant the other alighted, each bird accompanying himself to the 
tune of u to-le-do — to-lc-do — to-le-do," sounding the syllable "to" as he 
crouched to spring, u U n while in the air, and "do" as he alighted. 

This performance was kept up without intermission for more than a 
minute, when the birds suddenly discovered that they had an audience, 
and made off. 

With a little practice one can learn to call the birds very readily. I 
could have secured a very large number in this manner, had I beeu so 
disposed.

often misled me. It also has a scolding note precisely like many of the 
wrens. The female seems to be shyer and more retiring in her manner 
than the male. The nest is often placed in a brush heap, or, rather, in

44. Chrysuronia eliciae (Bourc. cV Mills. )? 

Bare. Only one specimen. 

[Note. — An adult male of this species from Sucuya, is so decidedly 
different from another from Guatemala (No. 33055, Masagua, Pacific 
coast ; O. Salvin) that should the differences observable prove constant 
the birds from the two countries would undoubtedly prove distinct races. 
The differences may be tabulated as follows : 

Guatemalan specimen: Above dark grass green, becoming bronzy 
only on upper tail-coverts, which are bronze-green, tinged with cop- 
pery bronze ; tail bright bronze-green, with more or less of a green cast 
in all lights. Throat and jugulura rich violet, changing to bluish, but 
never to greenish. Wing 2.05, tail 1.25, culmen .72. 

Wicaraguan specimen : Above bronzy green, the whole back and wing- 
coverts changing to golden bronze, in certain lights ; upper tail-coverts 
rich copper-bronze, not changing to greenish; tail very brilliant golden 
bronze, with only a very faint green tinge, in certain lights. Throat and 
jugulum rich violet-blue, changing to greenish. Wing 2, tail 1.15, cul- 
men .70. 

An adult female from Costa Eica (No. 91308, A. R. Endres) is ex- 
actly like the Nicaraguan specimen, except that the throat and jugu- 
lum are without the blue. 

The locality of the type specimen of G. elicias is unfortunately un- 
known, and upon referring to the original description (in Ann. Soc. 
Agr. Lyons, vol. ix, 1846, p. 314), I am unable to decide which form it 
agrees with best. I therefore hesitate to formally institute a new race 
by giving a name to the one not already provided. — R. R.]

seen sitting silently upon some branch not more than 10 or 12 feet from 
the ground, where it seems to be lost in profound meditation. Upon 
being disturbed it flies only a short distance, alights again and indi- 
cates its uneasiness only by repeated jerks of its peculiar spatulate tail- 
feathers.

jure the cattle. On this account it is protected by the inhabitants of the 
country, and it was only as a particular favor that I could persuade 
" Don Alejandro" to allow me to shoot a couple of specimens. The bird 
is exactly like a gigantic plover in appearance and motions, and is fre- 
quently seen in a state of domestication in the little flower gardens 
which occupy the inner courts of the houses of the aristocracy, and here 
it works for its living by keeping the garden clear of insects, worms, 
reptiles, &c. 

Contrary to its appearance, this bird is remarkably difficult to skin, 
especially around the breast and shoulders, where the skin is so firmly 
attached that a constant use of the knife is necessary.

III. — The Island of Omet^pe. 

The island of Ometepe is situated in Lake Nicaragua, about ten miles 
from the western shore, opposite the cities of Rivas and San Jorge. 
As its name signifies, its most prominent features are two bold and 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 391 

lofty volcanic peaks, which cover the greater portion of the island. One 
of these peaks, " El Vulcan de Ometepe," although there is no history 
of its being - in eruption previous to my visit to the island, commenced 
to show signs of activity while I was there. At the request of the al- 
calde of Moyogalpa, I made the asceut to the crater, but the absence 
of water rendering it impossible to remain on the peak, I was unable to 
accomplish anything in the way of collecting. 

The island is an extremely fertile one, and is inhabited mostly by a 
race of the pure Indian or Aztec stock. Agriculture is the principal oc- 
cupation of the people. 

The main products are cacao, plantains, mangoes, watermelons, mara- 
nons, cocoanuts, corn, beans, and in fact all the fruits, natural or in- 
troduced, which thrive in the tropics, besides valuable woods of various 
kinds. 

The climate is simply delightful, a fact to which General Walker testi- 
fied by constituting Omet6pe the sanitarium of his expedition. 

The avifauna of the island is not nearly so rich and varied as on the 
maiidand. Numerically, birds are abundant, but the number of species 
is more restricted than elsewhere in the republic. Water birds are 
abundant, especially in a large lagoon about a mile north of the village 
of Moyogalpa. The Parrots, Kingfishers, and Jays are the most numer- 
ous and conspicuous birds on the island. 

An apparently entire absence of the Turdidce, Tanagridce, Dendrocol- 
aptidw, Formicariidce, and Rhamphastidce, families well represented in 
other portions of Nicaragua, is noticeable. 

The deer is, so far as I have been able to learn, the only large mam- 
mal found on the island. 

Fam. TROGLODYTIDJB. 

* 1. Thryophilus pleurostictus Sol. 

Abundant. This Wren seems to replace C. capistratus of the adjacent 
mainland. After a diligent search I was unable to find any other species 
of Wren on the island. 

Song very melodious, clear, and sprightly, although not so loud as that 
of many of its family. Six specimens.

I was able to secure ouly oue specimen. This Warbler is gregarious, 
and spends most of its time on or near the ground in the densest por- 
tions of the forest, curiously resembling, in its feeding habits, Euco- 
metis spodocephala. The only note I ever heard it utter was a kind of 
chirp.

date this unruly member. Six specimens. 

Fam. CORVID^. 

* 14. Calocitta formosa (Sw.). 

Extremely abundant. Probably the most familiar and conspicuous 
bird on the island, where it renders itself quite obnoxious to the natives 
by its incessant depredations among the oranges and mangoes. 

It is one of the most audacious and impudent of all the members of 
its impudent family with which I am acquainted. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 393 

It has an exceedingly jaunty, dandified appearance, and, in flight, has 
the habit of slowly sailing over any suspicious object, especially a human 
being, uttering a curious, querulous note, and opening and shutting its 
long graceful tail-feathers in a manner very similar to the Scissor-Tail 
Flycatcher (Milvulus forficatus). 

The vocal powers of this Jay are indeed remarkable. I am not ac- 
quainted with any other bird which has so many distinct cries and notes, 
not even excepting the Parrots in their native state. 

I am almost certain that it imitates other birds, and it has often lured 
me into useless excursions into the dense, thorny forest, only to find 
that the supposed rarity was nothing but a rascally Jay, after all. The 
natives call it " Urraca," and insist that it can be taught to talk like a 
Parrot. Four specimens.

20. Tityra personata Jard. et Sell). 

Common. Gregarious. It is generally seen in the tops of the tallest 
trees, where it usually congregates in small flocks of six or eight. Its 
manner of obtaining its food is much like that of the Flycatchers, being 
insectivorus and catching its prey on the wing. Its note, although per- 
fectly familiar to me, is entirely beyond my powers of description, being 
neither a whistle or cry. 

Iris brown. Bill and bare orbital region dark red. Eight specimens. 

"21. Hydrostomus "latirostris" (Scl.). 

Not common. Habits similar to last. Did not hear the note. Three 
specimens. 

[Note.— Two adult males from Omete'pe agree pretty well with Mr. Sclater's Pachy- 
rhamphus latirostris (cf. P. Z. S., 1857, p 74), one of them having no trace whatever of 
rose-color on the throat, which, like the other lower parts, is uniform ash-gray. The

other, however, has a very faint rose tinge on the jugnliim. Both have the pileum 
glossy slate-hlack, and the back slaty plumbeous. The single female collected has 
the back clear oehraceous-rufous and the pileum slate-color, and, except that the 
pileum is not quite so dark colored, agrees exactly with the La Palma (Costa Rica) 
specimen referred by me (see these Proceedings, vol. 5, p. 307), with doubt, to H. homo- 
chrous Scl. (P. Z. S., 185 ( J, p. 142). 

In examining the National Museum collection of these birds, which includes 16 
adult males and 13 females and young males (which seem to be much alike), I note 
great variations in plumage, affecting chiefly the color of the back, which varies from 
clear plumbeous-gray, in marked contrast with the glossy black of the pileum, to 
glossy blacky and that of the lower parts, which varies from deep slaty gray, through 
intermediate shades, to nearly pure white. These variations do not seem to coincide 
with any definite geographical areas, however, and, remarkable though they appear, 
I cannot, from this material, formulate characters by which two or more races may be 
trenchantly defined. — R. R.]

a single specimen. The parent birds seemed to take particular care to 
"keep their broods out on the lily pads in the swamp, quite a distance 
from firm ground, where it was impossible to go either on foot or in a 
boat. I knew it to be useless to shoot them under these circumstances, 
as they would have been devoured by alligators. I can only say that 
the downy young of P. gymnostoma is of a grayish color, and looks, at a 
distance, like a little chicken with remarkably long legs.

TV.— Los SIbalos. 

"Los Sabalos" is the name of a hacienda owned by a German- Ameri- 
can gentleman, and is situated about thirty miles from Lake Nicaragua, 
on the river San Juan Del Norte. 

Mr. F. W. A. Lange, the courteous owner of " Los Sabalos," and a 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 397 

man of unusual intelligence and enterprise, is conducting what might 
be called an experimental farm, and has made a veritable oasis in the 
gloomy wilds of the dense, virgin forests which cover the entire basin 
of the San Juan Del Norte. 

" Los Sabalos " contains about the only cultivated ground between 
San Carlos, on the lake, and "El Castillo," on the river, a distance of 
about forty miles. It is situated at the junction of the San Juan and a 
large tributary stream. Here Mr. Lange is raising rubber, cacao, plan- 
tains, bananas, oranges, cocoanuts, bread fruit, " niaraiions," corn, beans, 
and potatoes, besides a number of other vegetables, the names of which 
I do not know. 

I am thus particular in speaking of his work because the experiment 
of raising all these fruits, many of them entirely new to the region, is a 
matter of practical and scientific interest to the world at large. 

Here Mr. Lange, a veritable "Robinson Crusoe," is absolutely "mon- 
arch of all he surveys," and almost entirely independent of the outside 
world, for, besides the fruits and vegetables mentioned, the river yields 
an abundance of excellent fish (principally shad) and lobsters, and the 
surrounding forests afford plenty of meat in the shape of deer l peccary, 
gnatousa, curassow, tinamou, and many other edible mammals and birds. 
There are also hot springs on his land to which medicinal virtues are 
ascribed. 

As a field for the ornithologist "Los Sabalos" surpasses by far any 
region the writer has ever visited. Three weeks' collecting at this point 
resulted in the securing of six entirely new and distinct species of birds. 
That is, one new species for every thirty skins secured ! Such a col- 
lecting ground should certainly receive more attention. 

The most prominent characteristics of the avifauna of this region 
may be briefly summarized as follows; but it must be borne in mind 
that a more thorough exploration may modify or even reverse conclu- 
sions, which are little more than speculations based upon imperfect ex- 
plorations. 

The Iroglodytidce, Tanagridce, Fringillidce, Dendrocolaptidce, Formi- 
«ariidce, and Trochilidcc are the families most abundantly represented. 
The Sylviidw, Icteridw, Tyrannidw, Cotingidce, Momotidcc, Alcedinidce, 
Ehamphastidce, Psiitacidce, Falconidw, Columbida.', and Cracidce are or- 
dinarily well represented. The remaining families are poorly repre- 
sented, and in some cases seem to be entirely wanting. 

On account of my time in this region being very limited, little atten- 
tion was given to the various water birds, which seem to be abundant.

*2. Cyphorinus lawrencii Scl. 

Apparently not common. While taking an evening walk through the 
thick forest I was suddenly startled by a number of these Wrens which 
I had disturbed in their nest, for it was quite dusk. They seemed to be 
on every side of me, uttering a shrill chirping protest against my intru- 
sion. I could barely discern their dusky forms as they flitted through 
the bushes. I tired almost at random, and succeeded in securing one 
specimen. 

They seemed to be gregarious, as I do not think there were less than 
ten or a dozen roosting together when I disturbed them. 

*3. Henicorhina leucosticta (Cab.).

Fam. MNIOTILTID^. 

7. Geothlypis trichas (Linn.). 
Abundant. Three specimens. 

*8. Geothlypis bairdi Nutting, sp. nov. 

Adult $ : Entire forehead and fore part of crown, lores, orbits, aurio- 
ulars, and malar region deep black. Upper parts rather dark but 
bright olive-green (much as in G. velata), including whole of occiput 
and hinder portion of crown ; lower parts bright yellow (much as in G. 
velata), the entire sides, however, yellowish olive-green. Bill brownish 
black, the gouys sometimes paler ; legs and feet horn-brown. Wing, 
2.30-2.35; tail, 2-2.10; culmen, .GO; depth of bill at base, .20; tarsus, 
.85 ; middle toe, .60. 

Adult $ : Similar to the $ , but lacking the black on the head, which is 
olive-green, the forehead and superciliaries distinctly, but not abruptly, 
more yellowish. Wing, 2.20 ; tail, 1.90 ; culmen, .55 ; depth of bill, .18 ; 
tarsus, .85 ; middle toe, .55. 

Hab. Los Sabalos Nicaragua (Nutting). 

This species is apparently not very closely related to any other 
hitherto described. In coloration it most resembles G. speciosa, with 
which it agrees in the extent and distribution of the black mask ; but 
this in G. speciosa is not clearly defined on the crown, as in the present 
species, but fades insensibly into the olive of the occiput. G. speciosa 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 399 

is likewise much browner above, of a much duller yellow beneath, and 
the proportions are totally different. While G. speciosa has much the 
slenderest bill of any member of the genus (with the possible excep- 
tion of G. semiflava, which I have not seen), G. bairdi has this member 
inucb larger than any of its congeners except G. rostrata, In the latter 
the bill is longer but less robust, a striking character of the present 
species consisting in the distinctly curved culmen, with the basal por- 
tion prominently ridged and unusually elevated, thus calling strongly 
to mind a characteristic feature of Heloncea sicainsoni Aud. 

The species is based on three examples, two males and a female, as 
follows : 

No. 91150, $ ad., Los Sabalos, Nicaragua, May 15, 1883 ; C. C. Nutting. 

No. 91151, $ ad., Los Sabalos, Nicaragua, May 2, 1883 ; 0. 0. Nutting. 

No. 91152, 9 ad., Los Sabalos, Nicaragua, May 14, 1883; C. C. Nutting. 

Note. — Since the above was written specimens have been sent to Mr. 
Osbert Salvin, who writes thus respecting them : " Geothlypis bairdi is 
very close indeed to G. semiftavd of Ecuador. The colors are slightly 
more olivaceous." It is not likely, however, that they are identical, 
geographical considerations decidedly favoring their distinctness. — R. E. 

Common. The thiee specimens secured were all shot in an open, 
marshy piece of ground near the river. This ground is covered with 
water in the rainy season, and a luxuriant growth of tall, coarse grass 
and weeds in the dry season. It is in these weeds that G. bairdi prefers 
to make its home. Song, loud, clear, and sprightly. Habits very simi- 
lar to those of G. trichas.

bed of the stream in the same manner as do our Cinclidod. One speci-

12. Ramphoccelus passerinii Bp. 

Very abundant. This richly colored Tanager is one of the most con- 
spicuous birds at " Los Sabalos." It seems to be gregarious, and evi- 
dently prefers marshy ground. There are large tracts of land near the 
river which are covered by a luxuriant growth of a large-leafed plant 
(probably a Caladium), and R. paHserinii cau almost always be seen ap- 
parently feeding on the species of insects peculiar to these plants. 

I have never heard these birds utter any note other than a short 
chirp. 

Thirteen specimens. Iris brown. Bill light blue.

13. Phcenicothraupis fuscicauda Cab. 

Abundant. Apparently gregarious. Prefers the most impenetrable 
recesses of the dense forest. 

It is a very silent and rather timid bird as a rule, and the females 
seemed to greatly exceed the males in numbers, both at Sucuya and 
Los Sabalos. Seven specimens secured. 

14. Plilogothraupis sanguinolenta (Less.). 

Although I only secured one specimen of this bird, Mr. Lange in- 
formed me that it is abundant at Los Sabalos at certain times, when it 
feeds largely on bauanas. Iris red.

18. Pitylus poliogaster Du Bus. 

Abundant. Gregarious. Generally seen in small flocks of eight or 
ten in the edge of the forest. Their note is a short whistle rather than 
chirp. It does not seem so timid as many other Tanagers, being more 
noisy and sociable. Three specimens. 

Fam. FRINGILLID^.

of Mr. Lange's plantain patch, and also a patch of high marsh grass, 
with occasional brush heaps. Five specimens. 

*20. Oryzoborus funereus Scl. ?* 

Apparently common. Habits similar to preceding species. Two 
specimens. 

* Adult 9 (No. 91193, Los Sabalos, Nicaragua, May 16, 1883, C. C. Nutting): Above 
uniform dark uniber-browu; beneath deep cinnamon-brown, shaded with umber an- 
teriorly. Axillars and entire lining of wing white. Bill uniform brownish black ; 
feet dusky. Wing, 2.10; tail, 2.05; culmeu, .55; depth of bill at base, .50; width of 
mandible, .42; tarsus, .70; middle toe, .48. 

Young $ (No. 91194, same locality and collector, April 20, 1883): Similar to the 
adult, but rather darker above, with the tertials and wing-coverts very indistinctly 
edged with dull rusty ; fulvous of auterior lower parts more obscured by brown, and 
white of under wing-coverts tinged with ochreous-buff. Bill blackish, but gonys 
varied with yellowish white. Wing, 2.20; tail, 2. 10; culmen, .52; depth of bill, .50; 
width of mandible, .42; tarsus, .65; middle toe, .47. 

These specimens are referred with some doubt to O. funereus, the female of which

appears to be hitherto undescribed. As they agree very well, however, with the males 
of that species iu dimensions and white under wing-coverts, I have thought best to 
bo name them provisionally, or until males may be obtained. — R. R. 

Note. — Mr. Salvin, to whom these specimens have been sent for comparison, says 
that they "are probably the female of O. cethiops of Western Ecuador, but the male 
is wanted to make certain. Anyhow, the two birds are closely allied." Should the 
species prove to be distinct from O. oethiops, as will most likely be the case, I propose 
lor it the name of O. salvini. — R. R. 

* Oryzoborus nuttingi Ridgw. MS. 

Sp. cii. — Adult $ : Uniform black, without white on underside of wing or base of 
primaries; under surface of primaries dull dark grayish, paler (but not inclining to 
white) basally. Bill pale brown. Wing, 2.70-2.75; tail, 2.70-2.75 ; culnien,.70; depth 
of bill at base, .65; width of mandible, .55; tarsus, .70-. 75; middle toe, .55. (Types 
91195 and 91196, Los Siibalos, Nicaragua, C. C. Nutting.) 

Adult $: Above uniform dark umber-brown; beneath uniform, rather dark, cinna- 
mon-brown ; lining of wings rather light fulvous. Bill brownish black ; " iris browu,*' 
feet dusky. Wing, 2.70; tail, 2.70 ; culmen, .70; depth of bill at base, .60; tarsus, 
.70; middle toe, .65. (Type 91193, Los Sibalos, Nicaragua, May 10, 1883; C. C. 
Nutting.) 

Young 9 : Similar to the adult 2 , but tertials bordered with light rusty, and lower 
parts much less reddish. Bill uniform black. Wing, 2.60; tail, 2.60; culmen, .65; 
depth of bill at base, .60; tarsus, .70; middle toe, .60. (Type 91,197, same locality, 
etc., as the above specimens.) 

This line Oryzoborux is very distinct not only from O. funereus, but also from all 
other species of which I have been able to find descriptions. The adult male i» 
characterized by its entirely black plumage, with no white whatever on wings or tail, 
the inner webs of the primaries grayish black, becoming paler grayish basally. It is- 
one of the largest species of the genus, and has the bill remarkably robust, the base 
of the culmen much arched, and dividing the frontal feathers for .25 of an inch. — R. R.

Abundant. There is a very remarkable fact in connection with this 
bird at Los Sabales. 

Fully half the specimens seen, as well as those secured, have the tail 
feathers cut off at a point about one-half the distance from insertion to 
terminus. This is true of adult specimens. This is so noticeable that 
I thought the birds thus mutilated to be a wonderful new species of 
•" bob tailed" Flycatcher. 

So far as I have been able to learn, this is a fact unique iu ornithol- 
ogy. 

In all other respects the specimens with the tails cut are exactly like 
vthose whose tails are entire. Four specimens.

Fam. PIPEID^. 

*38. Chiromachaeris candeei (Parz:.). 

Rare. Only one specimen secured iu dense forest on the other side 
of the tributary river which enters the San Juan del Norte at Los 
Sabalos. 

"This species seems to me to be quite as properly referable to Mitrephanes (c/, 
Coues, Bull. Nutt. Oru. Club, January, 1882, p. 55) as to Myiobius. In fact, 1 would 
prefer placing it in that genus. It is true that it differs from the type species 
(M. phceocercii8) in certain details of structure, but at the same time it differs more 
from the typical Myiobii. Of the two hitherto known species of the genus, M. phceo- 
cercus and M. aurantiiventris, it approaches most nearly to the latter, both in form and 
coloration. It differs from both, however, in the less developed crest and in the more 
rounded wing, the primaries exceeding the secondaries by only about .40 of an inch, 
instead of .60-.70, as in the above-named species. The bill is also longer in propor- 
tion to its breadth, but is otherwise of similar form; and the tail, instead of being 
decidedly emarginate, is distinctly, though slightly, rounded. 

Its coloration at once suggests that of M. auraniiiventris, the back, breast, and cris- 
suni being almost exactly the snine color; but M. aurantiiventria has the throat fulvous, 
instead of white; the pileum dark olive, instead of slate, and the posterior lower 
parts much dulh r yellow, and also much less abruptly of this color; besides, the 
white supraloral line and orbital ring of M. capitalia are totally absent. 

Mr. Nutting's specimen, which appears to be the second on record, may be described 
as follows : 

Sp. ch.— Adult $ (No. 91,233, Los Sfibalos, Nicaragua, May 4, 1883; C. C. Nut- 
ting). Entire pileum uniform brownish slate, this color extending over the auricu- 
lars, which, however, have whitish shaft-streaks ; lores slate-gray, bordered above 
by a distinct white line extending back to and involving the eyelids; back, scapulars, 
and rump bright greenish-olive, in abrupt and very marked contrast with the slate- 
color of the head; lesser wing-coverts olive, but rest of wings dusky, the middle and 
greater coverts tipped with bright ochraceous (forming two distinct bands), and ter- 
tials broadly edged with the same; other remiges narrowly and rather indistinctly 
edged with light brownish. Tail light grayish-brown, the feathers edged with a 
more fulvous tint. Chin and throat dull white; jugulum and breast bright ochra- 
ceous, tinged with olive laterally; abdomen and sides bright primrose yellow; cris- 
sum buff; axillars and lining of wing yellowish ochraceous. Inner webs of remiges 
broadly edged with buffy ochraceous. Bill black, the base of the mandible pale 
colored ; feet dark brownish. 

Wing, 2.40; tail, 2.30; culmen, .50; width of bill at base, .30; tarsus, .60; middle 
to.-, .32. 

t Contopus depressirostris Ridgw. MS. 

Sp. ch. — Adult : Above grayish hair-brown, the pileum decidedly darker ; middle 
and greater wing-coverts tipped with pale brownish-gray, forming two rather dis- 
tinct bands across the wing; tertials edged with the same. Tail slightly but decidedly 
emarginate, uniform grayish hair-brown. Chin and throat grayish-white; sides of 
head, jugulum, breast, and sides, brownish-gray; middle of belly, anal region, and

It is generally found hopping about in thick bushes or brush heaps. 

Its song also is like that of a wren, being loud, varied, and melodious, 
while the other members of its family, so far as I have been able to as-

In coloration this species comes nearest to C. schotti, but has the throat and ventral 
re-ion much more nearly white and the pectoral region less olivaceous. The dimen- 
sions arc nearly the same, except that the bill is larger and more depressed. In the 
character of the bill there is a close resemblance to the several West Indian forms of 
this species, especially C. bahamensis, and to C. punensis of Western Ecuador, but the i 
species is clearly distinct. 

* Judging from the material in the National Museum collection, there is a very 
marked difference between specimens of Cymbilanivs from Central America, as far 
south, at least, as Panama, and those from Eastern South America. The Museum 
unfortunately possesses but a single skin from South America, an adult $ (No. 32823) 
from Cayenne; but this is decidedly different from four northern females. The 
chief difference consists in the much narrower light bars on the upper parts, these 
being also much paler in color, or fulvous-white (nearly pure white on the tail), in-

state these birds seem to keep in the trees at a considerable distance 
from the ground, while the Formicariidce in general are almost never 
seen at any considerable distance from mother earth. Only one speci- 
men secured. 

49. Rhamphocaenus rufiventris Bp. 

Not common. One specimen killed in dense forest near a running 
stream. 

*50. Cercomacra tyrannina Scl. 

Apparently rare. One specimen. 
*51. Myrmeciza immaculata Scl. 

Common. Lives almost entirely on the ground in the dense forest* 
Rather shy and silent. 

*52. Formicarius hoffmani (Cab.). 

Rather common. Exceedingly shy. I have frequently watched with 
astonishment the curious maneuvers of this bird when suddenly ap- 
proached. Instead of at once resorting to flight like most birds, it 
spreads its wings, lowers its head, and sneaks silently and quickly along, 
taking advantage of every inequality of the ground and bunch of dried 
leaves, until at a safe distance from the intruder, when it takes flight. 
There is something inexpressibly cunning and knowing in the whole 
pose and action of the bird on such occasions that is quite laughable. 

The note is a loud, clear whistle, followed at a considerable interval 
by two or more lower and less accentuated ones, and has a very re- 
markable ventriloquial quality. So pronounced is this latter quality 



stead of deep ocbreous or fulvous. The dark bars on the lower parts are likewise 
much more distinct, as well as closer together, and the size considerably less. The 
nieasnrements, however, are not smaller than those of a specimen from Panama, which, 
nevertheless, agrees strictly in coloration with examples from Costa Rica, Veragua, 
and Nicaragua. 

It being probable that the South American bird is the true Thamnophilus lineatus of 
Vieillot, I propose to separate the Central American form as C. lineatusfasciatus. — R. R.

that, when the bird is quite near, the note seems to issue from the trees 
instead of from the ground, whence it really proceeds. 

The note is easily imitated, and I found that the bird could be secured 
by calling it. But it is necessary for the collector to be well concealed, 
as the bird has remarkably keen eyes and will not approach a suspicious 
object.

* Costa Rican specimens in the National Museum collection, labeled G. dives, are 
evidently distinct and apparently unnamed. They clearly represent a distinct form, 
somewhat intermediate between G. dives and G. perspicillata ; but since it possesses 
some peculiar features, I propose to characterize it as a distinct species, for which the 
name intermedia is proposed. 

The three allied species may be distinguished as follows : 

a. Wing-coverts very distinctly spotted with ochraceous; breast pale buff, or buffy 
white, very broadly and distinctly streaked with black ; a very distinct black rictal 
stripe, or "bridle." 

1. G. perspicillata. Flanks white, narrowly striped wit h black or dusky; back 
olive-brown, marked with distinct guttate streaks of buff. Hab. Panama and Vera- 
gua (specimens from the former locality only examined by me.) 

2. G. INTERMEDIA. Flanks bright ochraceous, wholly nnstreaked ; back slaty (but 
slightly tinged with olive), with few or no streaks. Hab. Co6ta Rica (Angostura and 
Talamanca ; Tucurrique specimens not seen). 

b. Wing-coverts without trace of ochraceous spots ; breast bright "foxy " ochraceous, 
narrowly and indistinctly streaked with black ; no trace of black rictal stripe. 

3. G.DIVES. Flanks bright ''foxy " ochraceous, immaculate; back dusky brownish 
Blate, the feathers with fulvous shafts. Hab. Nicaragua (Greytown and Los Saba-

take my effects from the custom-house free of all duties, and for other 
favors. 

Sr. Don. Justo Cardenas, for kind assistance in many matters. 

Sr. Don Alijandro Chamberlain, for his genuine hospitality and 
courteous aid. 

M. Green, esq., for valuable aid and information. 

Dr. Earl Flint and David Murry, esq., for courtesies too numer- 
ous to mention.

Don Jose Angel Luna and sister, and Donna Carolina Canton, 
for valuable aid and information on the island of Ometepe. 

Sr. N. Martinez, for kind hospitality at San Carlos.

about .05 of an inch wide, and .10-.15 of an inch apart ; crissum black, very narrowly 
barred with white, and tinged with light rufous. Lining of wing white, the basal 
half of the feathers abruptly grayish. Tibne, uniform, deep smoky-gray. Bill olive- 
greenish, more horn-gray terminally; "iris red," legs and feet dusky; wing, 2.80; 
ail, 1.10; culmen, .68; tarsus, 1.20; middle toe, 1.25. 

This apparently new species is related to both P. albigularis Lawr. and P. cinereicep* 
Lawr., but is evidently distinct. It agrees with the former in the white throat, and 
with the latter in the grayish head ; but it differs from both in a number of charac- 
ters. The three are so nearly allied, however, that comparative diaguoses may beet 
show the differences, which are as follows : 

A. Head without any gray; wing-coverts with lighter bars. 

1. P. albigularis. Chin and throat distinctly white; pileum russet-brown, and 
Bide of head rufous. Wing, 3.05-3.10; tail, 1.25-1.30; culmen, .68; tarsus, 1.18-1.20; 
middle toe, 1.15-1.25. Hab. Panama. 

B. Head mostly gray ; wing-coverts without lighter bars. 

2. P. leucogastra. Chin and throat distinctly white ; jugulum pale cinnamon, 
fading to white on lower breast ; white bars on sides and flanks, very narrow. Wing, 
2.80; tail, 1.10; culmen, .68; tarsus, 1.20; middle toe, 1.25. Hab. Eastern Nicaragua 
(Los Sabalos). 

3. P. CINEREICEP8. Chin and throat pale cinnamon, the former inclining to whit- 
ish ; jugulum and whole breast rich chestnut-rufous ; white bars on sides and flanks, 
very broad. Wing, 2.90; tail, — ; culmen, .60; tarsus, 1.15; middle toe, 1.20. Hab,

OIV SOME COSTA RICAN BIRDS, WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF SEVERAL 
SUPPOSED NEW SPECIES. 

By ROBERT RIBGWAY. 

The following interesting species are included in a small collection of 
birds lately received by the National Museum from Sr. Don Jose" C. 
Zeledon, of San Jose\ Costa Rica. 

1. Carpodectes antonige, Zeledon, MS., Eidg. Ibis, Jan. 1884, 27, pi. ii. 

Sp. OH.— Adult $ (No. 91832, Pirris, May, 1883; Juan Zeledon, col- 
lector). Similar to G. nitidus, but rather smaller, the bill mostly bright 
yellow, the wings wholly pure white, and the pileum much paler pearl- 
blue. Plumage, pure white, except the forehead and crown, which are 
pale pearl-blue, or glaucous, and back, scapular, rump, upper tail-cov- 
erts, and tail, which are a more delicate shade of the same. Bill, clear 
lemon-yellow ("wax-yellow" in fresh specimen) with distinctly marked 
black stripe along the culmen ; " iris, dark ; feet, black." Wing 5.40, 
tail 2.G0, culmen .70, tarsus .90, middle toe .80. 

This lovely species much resembles G. nitidus, except as pointed out 
above, and is clearly distinct. 

Mr. Zeledon's notes respecting this species are as follows : 
"You will be agreeably surprised to learn that I have made a most 
unexpected discovery in the shape of a new Garpodectes. The bird is 
snowy white, except on the back and top of the head, where a faint 
wash of gray is to be seen, all the back of the neck being pure white, 
like the rest of the body. No traces of the gray tinge are present on 
any other part of the plumage. The bill is somewhat smaller, less 
swollen, and more curved than in G. nitidus, and of a yellow color, with 
a black line along the culmen to the very tip ; the feet are black, not 
plumbeous, as in the latter species; the dimensions are pretty much the 
same, excepting that the tail is rather shorter than in G. nitidus. 

"There is but one specimen in my possession, which was obtained by 
my brother Juan, at Pirris, southwestern side of Costa Rica. It is a 
fine adult male, and was obtained in May last. 

" The C. nitidus has been obtained only on the eastern side of the 
country. I am inclined, therefore, to believe that the present species is 
the western representative of the genus.

u I have named this charming bird Carpodectes antonicc, after the dear 
sister whose death 1 mourn." 

2. Vireo carmioli Bainl? 

A single skin of a Vireo, from Pirris, much resembles the type of 
V. carmioli, but is larger and somewhat different in coloration, the colors 
being decidedly paler. It may be described as follows : 

Adult (No. 91825, Pirris, 1882 ; J. Cooper) : Above, dull olive-green, be- 
coming slightly more brownish on the head ; wings and tail, dusky ; both 
rows of wing-coverts broadly tipped with pale sulphur-yellow, or yellowish 
white, and tertials broadly edged with the same; secondaries, primaries,, 
and rectrices, narrowly edged with light olive-green. A broad and con- 
tinuous superciliary stripe of dull sulphur yellow, rendered more dis- 
tinct anteriorly by contrast with a dusky spot immediately in front of the 
eye ; lower eyelid whitish ; sides of head otherwise olivaceous, like upper 
parts. Lower parts dull, light sulphur-yellow, much obscured laterally 
with olivaceous, the throat and crissum inclining to whitish. Maxilla, 
dusky ; mandible pale, with brownish tip. Wing, 2.75 j tail, 2.20 ; cul- 
men, .45 ; tarsus, .70 ; middle toe, .40. 

I am not able to make a satisfactory comparison of this bird with 
V. carmioli, for the reason that the National Museum possesses but a 
single adult example of the latter, the type, which, moreover, is a female. 
It measures, wing 2.50, tail 2, culmen .40, tarsus .70, middle toe .38, be- 
ing thus smaller than the specimen described above. 

3. Phcenicothraupis carmioli Lawr. 

A second specimen of this rare species differs from the type in hav- 
ing the plumage of a duller or more sombre cast, and faintly tinted or 
stained here aud there with dull red. These dull reddish stains occur 
on the pileum, back, rump, greater wing-coverts, breast, and sides* 
The specimen is, perhaps, a young male, since tbe bill is decidedly less 
arched than that of the type, and presents other evidences of imperfect 
development. Unfortunately, the sex and precise locality are not indi- 
cated. The two specimens compare in measurements as follows :

This species seems wrongly placed in Phcenicothraupis, the propor- 
tions being quite different from those of all the species of that genus. 
Except in the form of the bill, which is much more compressed, it agrees 
better with Pyranga, while in many respects it comes very near to 
Orthogonys. Since it should probably constitute a new genus, some-

■what intermediate between the last two, I propose the generic namo 
Chlorothraupis.* 

4. Tachyphonus nitidissimus Salv. 

An adult male from Pirris (No. 91822, May, 1883; Juan Zeledon) 
agrees with a typical example from Veragua, except that the brownish 
orange crown-patch is more deeply colored. 

5. Tachyphonus luctuosus Lafr. & D'Orb. 

Two Costa Rican specimens (No. 68158, Talamanca, and 91821, Dos 
Novillos, December) agree exactly with specimens from Panama, Bogota, 
Guayaquil, Demerara and Brazil (Eug. do Garaa); but No. .39*144, S ad., 
from Tuiz (Carmiol, coll.), has a small, though distinct, spot of straw- 
yellow on the crown, thus showing an approach to T. nitidis simus. 

6. Chlorospingus pileatus Salvia. 

A male, apparently immature, differs from an unquestionable adult in 
the following particulars : The dark color of the head is of a quite differ- 
ent shade, being dull slate-color instead of blackish fuliginous ; the olive- 
green on the upper parts is paler, as is also the yellowish olive of the 
lower parts. 

A young specimen in first plumage (No. 91824, Pirris, 1882; J. Cooper) 
has the head colored as iu the preceding, but upper parts are a dull 
olive, with little green tinge, except on the wings and tail, while the 
lower parts are almost entirely dull light grayish, inclining to white on 
the abdomen, the sides and flanks, however, especially the latter, tinged 
with olive-green. The mandible is whitish, whereas in the adults it is 
deep black, like the maxilla. 

7. Lanio melanopygius Ridgw. 

Lanio leucothorax ruelanopygins Ridgw. Pr. U. S. Nat. Mus. 1883," Saxv. &, 
Godm. Biol. Centr. Am. Aves, Vol. I, Dec. 1883, 305. 

A single adult male from Pirris differs from two others, apparently 
quite adult (Nos. 47445, Angostura, Jan. 10, 1867, J. Carmiol, and 39036, 
Payuriqui, March 14, 1865, same collector), in having the whole rump 
solid deep black instead of bright yellow, the crissum black instead of 
yellow, and the black of the wings and tail much more intense. The 
differences are in fact so great that a difference of race at least seems 
quite likely. The original description of the species (Proc. Zool. Soc. 
Lond., 1864, p. 581) does not mention the color of the rum]); but the 
plate in Exotic Ornithology (plate 32) represents unmistakably the black - 
ruinped form. It appears from the text, however, that the figure of the 
male may have been taken from a Veraguan example, from which we 
may infer that Veraguan specimens and those from the southern portion 
of Costa Rica agree in having the whole rump deep black. Should the 

*In their Biologia Central*- Americana, Are*, Vol. I., p. 297 (December, 188..), Messrs. 
Salvix & Godman have already adopted this name from my MS., quoting "Pr. U. S. 
Nat. Mus., 1883," the quotation in question having reference to the present article 
■which was submitted for publication early in August, 1883. Messrs. Salvin & God- 
man include along with C. carmioli the Orthogonys olivacem of Cassin; but my type of 
the genus Chlorothraupis is Phamicothraupis carmioli Lawr.

difference prove constant, one of the forms requires a new name ; and 
L. leucothorax having been based upon specimens from Tucurrique, the 
central part of Costa Rica, it follows that the black-rumped one is the 
one to be named. Accordingly, in view of its probable distinctness, I 
propose for it the name L. melanopygius. 

There appears to be little difference in dimensions, the three speci- 
mens measuring as follows :

8. Empidonax atriceps Salvin. 

The single specimen of this species may be described as follows : 
Sp. ch.— Adult (No. 91829, Pirris, Costa Rica, 1882; J. Cooper): 
Pilenm and nape uniform sooty black, somewhat paler on the forehead; 
back and scapulars dark sooty olive, or olive-sepia, the rump similar, 
but paler; tail uniform dull black; wings black, the middle coverts 
broadly tipped with the color of the back, the greater coverts broadly 
tipped with lighter brown, and tertials edged with the same. Orbital 
ring, chin, and throat, light grayish yellow ; sides of head dull oliva- 
ceous, much the same tint as the rump ; jugulum and breast raw-umber 
brown, becoming more ochraceous posteriorly, the abdomen and cris- 
sum, also axillars and lining of wing, pale dull yellowish buff; maxilla 
black, mandible whitish ; legs and feet black. Wing 2.45 ; tail 2.25, 
deeply emarginated ; culmen .45, width of bill at base .22, tarsus .65, 
middle toe .35. 

It seems to me that this species has been wrongly placed in the genus 
Empidonax ; at any rate, the specimen under examination seems strictly 
congeneric with Mitrephanes aurantiiventris, with which it agrees very 
minutely in details of structure, although of smaller dimensions. 

9. Empidonax viridescens sp. riov. 

Sp. ch. — Adult (No. 91826, U. S. Nat. Mus., Cervantes, Costa Rica, 
1882 ; J. Cooper) : Above uniform bright yellowish olive-green or oil- 
green, becoming less yellowish on rump; tail dull grayish, feathers 
edged with olive-green ; wings grayish dusky, except lesser coverts, 
which are rich oil-green, like back, &c. ; -middle coverts broadly tipped 
with deep olive-buff, greater coverts broadly tipped with paler, more 
yellowish buff; tertials edged with pale greenish; orbital ring (appa- 
rently interrupted at and above anterior angle of the eye) yellowish 
white or pale sulphur-yellow; anterior lower parts light yellowish olive, 
becoming pare yellow on the abdomen, the crissum similar but paler; 
middle of throat tinged with or inclining to yellow ; edge of wing tinged 
with saffron-yellow. Maxilla deep black, mandible wholly whitish, in-

dining to orange along tomia; legs and feet black. Wing 2.75; tail 
2.35, ctilinen .62 (from extreme base), bill from nostril .35, width at base 
.32, tarsus .08, middle toe .40. 

In coloration this species presents a remarkably close resemblance to 
E. fiarescens Lawr. The breast, however, is paler and decidedly less 
fulvous, the yellow of the abdomen paler, the upper parts have less 
of a russet cast, and the wing bands are paler. Besides, it is consider - 
bly larger, the measurements of an adult male of E.flavescens being as 
follows : Wing 2.40, tail 2.05, culmen (from extreme base) .02, bill from 
nostril .35, width at base .28, tarsus .02, middle toe .35. 
20. Pittasoma michleri zeledoni, subsp. nov. 

Subsp. CH. — Adult $ : Similar to P. michleri, but much larger, and 
with the head entirely black, except a few touches of chestnut on the 
auriculars. Wing, 4.35; tail, 1.G0; culmen, 1.25; tarsus, 2; middle toe, 
1.25. 

Type, No. 91841, Eio Sucio, Costa Pica, 1881 ; J. Cooper, collector. 

The measurements of an adult male of P. michleri (No. 53778, Panama ; 
McLeannau), are as follows: Wing, 4.05; tail, 1.35; culmen, 1.05; tar- 
sus, 1.85 ; middle toe, 1.10. In P. michleri only the pileum is uniform 
black, the entire cheeks and auriculars being chestnut, while the black 
of the chin, throat, and malar region is spotted with the same. 

11. Acanthidops bairdi Zeledon, MS. 

In the original description of this species (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 
4, p. 330) the writer accidentally omitted to credit the specific name to 
Mr. Zeledon. The oversight is much regretted, and the present oppor- 
tunity is taken to make amends. 

Besides the foregoing species, the following were contained in the 
collection received from Mr. Zeledon, all of which are included in that 
gentleman's excellent list* of Costa Bican birds.

ON AW ANTIQUE ROMAN MOSAIC FROM CARTHAGE, NOW IN THE 
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Communicated by O. II. HEAP, Esq., United States Consul- 
General at Tunis. 

Many who visited the Centennial Exhibition will remember seeing in 
the Tunisian section the large and beautifully executed mosaic, repre- 
senting a Numidian lion seizing au antelope. This admirable work, 
which probably dates from 100 to 50 years before the Christian era, is 
of Roman workmanship, and was discovered at Carthage in 1873. It 
formed a very small part of the vault floor of a temple dedicated to 
Astarte (Aphrodite), the tutelary deity of the Carthaginians. The 
Romans, who assimilated the gods of the people they conquered as 
easily as they absorbed their territories, erected a temple to the god- 
dess of Carthage and adorned it with great splendor. It was situated 
on a commanding hill facing the sea, near the citadel and other public 
buildings.* 

The Tunisian Government a short time since enacted a law prohibiting 
private search for antiquities, but granted this privilege to the son of 
the prime minister at that time in power. The finder of treasures or 
antique works of art was required, under severe penalties, to give im- 
mediate information to this official. The Arabs, however, in spite of 
imprisonment, bastinado, or fire, not uufrequently appropriated what- 

* The remains of some of these edifices are still visible, although now the most con- 
spicuous object is the chapel, erected in 18oo, by Louis Philippe. King of the French, 
And dedicated to the memory of his ancestor, Louis IX, surnamed "the Saint," on 
the spot where tradition says he died of the plague in 1270 while besieging Tunis.

ever fragments of sculpture, inscriptions, or mosaics, and especially 
funeral lamps and vases and coins they might find, and sold them se- 
cretly to travelers and strangers. 

Thus it came to pass, one day, that an old Arab sheik informed the 
British agent and consul-general, with a great show of secrecy and 
mystery, that he had discovered a wonderful mosaic floor, a portion of 
which be offered to take up and deliver for a consideration. He de- 
sribed the floor, which, even with due allowance for the imagination of 
the Bedouin, was evidently one of the most beautiful and complete works 
of the kind that had ever been discovered at Carthage. The sheik re- 
fused to tell where it was, but promised to bring the piece he had taken 
up to Sir Kichard Wood's country seat, at Carthage, at night. He had 
recently " eaten stick", or received the bastinado, for having sold some 
antiquities to a tourist, and had reason to be cautious. A few nights 
later, however, he came with some eight or ten Arabs who bore the 
mosaic on their shoulders. A bargain was made, and the precious frag- 
ment was deposited in a magazine, where it remained until shipped to 
Philadelphia in 1875. 

The floor of the temple from which it was taken has since been ex- 
amined. It is of vast extent and the designs were all life-size. From 
the Arab's description it appears that the center figure represented 
a female, probably the goddess Astarte, driving a chariot drawn by 
stags, and around this central design were grouped animals of various 
kinds — lions, tigers, leopards, stags, antelopes, giraffes, boars, hares, 
even hippopotami, crocodiles, snakes, and fishes. The only part of the 
floor that the Arabs succeeded in removing besides the " mosaic lion n 
was the principal design, representing Astarte in the chariot. This 
was on its way to Sir Kichard Wood's, when unfortunately one of the 
bearers slipped and fell, and the others fearing to be crushed under it — 
for it was even larger and more ponderous than the lion — allowed it to 
fall to the ground, where it was broken into fragments. The only por- 
tion, therefore, of this magnificent pavement that now exists is that in the 
National Museum ; the rest was broken in the hasty and clumsy efforts 
of the Arabs to detach it in sections from its bed. 

The " mosaic lion," as it came to be named at the Philadelphia Exhi- 
bition, is the largest and most perfect ancient mosaic in America, and 
it is quite unlikely that anything equal to it will ever find its way to the 
United States hereafter. 

When the Vandals invaded Africa they destroyed all works of art, 
and to them are due the many headless, armless, and noseless statues 
found in Barbary. In destroying the temple of Astarte their icono- 
clastic frenzy was probably more immediately directed against the 
statuary and other sculptures and in overthrowing them, together with 
the walls of the edifice. The floor was covered with debris, upon which, 
in the course of centuries, a deep layer of dust was deposited, which pro- 
tected the mosaic from the corroding effects of wind and rain, and to 
this we may attribute its perfect state of preservation.

Vol. VI, No. 27. Washington, D. C. April 11, 1884. 

When the Tunisian Government was about sending its collection to 
Philadelphia in 1875, Sir Eichard Wood very liberally offered to send 
this mosaic, which he had originally intended to present to the British 
Museum. It was packed with great care, and the steamship companies 
were earnestly begged to give directions to have it handled with every 
precaution. It was, however, a trying moment when the heavily iron- 
bound case was opened, for it was feared that it would be found to con, 
tain nothing but a mass of small parti-colored stones. It was, therefore- 
a surprise as well as gratification to find the mosaic intact. 

Its dangers, however, were not yet over, for after it was put in its 
place in the exhibition it was subject to the attacks of greedy visitors, 
who made determined, and occasionally successful, attacks upon it for 
the purpose of obtaining mementos. 

After the close of the Centennial Exhibition it remained on deposit in 
the " Permanent Exhibition" until Sir Eichard Wood, with graceful 
courtesy and liberality, presented it to the National Museum at Wash- 
ington, where it is to be hoped it will long remain, a unique and valu- 
able relic of the most ancient and renowned republic in the world's his- 
tory.

ON THE §EELETON OF PHOCA (HISTRIOPHOCA) FA8CIATA, ZIM- 

MEBMAIV. 

By FREDERICK W. TRUE, M. S., 

Curator of the Department of Mammals. 

The National Museum is at present in possession of an interesting 
series of specimens of the Eibbon Seal, consisting of four skins, three 
skulls, and a single skeleton. The two finest skins — that of a female of 
advanced age (13285) and that of an adult male (13284) — were obtained 
by Mr. William H. Dall in 1880, in Plover Bay, East Siberia. The 
skeleton of the female was preserved, and forms the principal basis of 
this paper. 

In addition to this material there are also in the Museum a skin and 
two much broken skulls of young males, one of which (13364) was ob- 
tained by Mr. E. W. Nelson at Cape Eomanzoff, Alaska, in May, 1880; 
the other (13363) at Cape Prince of Wales in the autumn of 1879. 
There is, besides, in the Ethnological Department of the Museum, a 
skin of the species under consideration, in the form of an Eskimo bag. 

The external characteristics of the Eibbon Seal are quite well known. 
The sexes differ widely in color, the male being black, with a yellowish 
white band surrounding the fore limbs, and passing over the back, while

the female, although having the same markings, is of a light, almost 
silvery, hue. The whiskers are crenulate. The nails are of moderate 
size and of a brown tint. 

The Ribbon Seal has been imperfectly known since 1781, but the first 
description of any considerable fullness is that of Von Schrenck^ pub- 
lished in 1859.* This observer, however, was unable to obtain the skele- 
ton and the characters of the latter, except so far as the teeth were con- 
cerned, have until recently remained undescribed. In a paper upon 
the mammals collected during the "Vega" expedition, published some 
months ago by Nordquist,f the skull is described somewhat at length 
and three imperfect figures are given. 

The genus Histriophoca was established by Dr. Gill inl873, upon the 
basis of Von Schrenck's observations of the exterior and teeth.! His 
diagnosis is as follows: "The structural (and especially dental) char- 
acters of this species, according to Von Schrenck, indicate a generic 
distinction from all the familiar forms of the subfamily Phocince. The 
molars (except the first) are two-rooted as in the typical Phocina; but 
in external form are simply conic or have rudimentary cusps, thus re- 
sembling Halichcerus. The genus may be named Histriophoca." 

In July of the present year, at which time the cleaned and mounted 
skeleton was received from Rochester, I published a fuller and some- 
what different diagnosis of the genus.§ 

After more prolonged si ndy of the skeleton, and comparison with 
those of other species, I am somewhat in doubt as to the relationships 
of this seal. The skull presents remarkably close affinities to that of 
Phoca fcetida, the representative of the subgenus Pnsa, as defined by 
Professor Allen. The most absolute differences are in the shape of the 
alveolar border of the maxillary, which is curved ventrally and laterally 
in Histriophoca, but is practically straight in Pnsa, and in the number of 
sacral vertebrae, there bejng four in Push and three in Histriophoca. There 
are also a number of relative differences, of which the most salien t are as 
follows : The accessory cusps of the molars are less developed in Histrio- 
phoca than in Pusa. The tibia is less curved in the former than in the 
latter, the crest of the ileum is more everted and the sexes vary more 
in color. The rooting of the molars in Histriophoca is different from 
that which obtains in any of the subgenera of Phoca, in being variable. 
The first two, and possibly the third, would seem to be single-rooted in 
the majority of cases. 

If the taxonomy of the Phocids proposed by Professor Allen in his 
recent admirable work is accepted, none of the characters which have 
been enumerated are sufficient to raise Histriophoca to generic rank. In

Pagophilus there is a less number of sacral vertebrae than in the other 
subgenera, and the sexes are widely different in eolor, yet it is included 
by Professor Allen within the genus Phoca. Histriophoca fascial a can- 
not then be debarred on account of its possession of these same char- 
acters. It seems most logical to include the last-named species as a 
subgenus in Phoca, between Pusa and Pagophilus. To raise Pagophilus 
to the rank of a genus (as proposed by Dr. Gill), and to combine with 
it Histriophoca, would, in my estimation, make an isolation between 
them and Pusa which does not exist, while to make of each of the first 
mentioned a distinct genus would make the classification still more 
artificial. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE CRANIUM. 

The muzzle. — The muzzle,* and indeed all of that portion of the skull 
which is anterior to the auditory bullae, is remarkably short. The 
breadth at the canines is about the same relatively as in P.fcetida and 
P. grcenlandica. The "palate" is rudely triangular, shortened in the 
anteroposterior direction, but little compressed laterally, and not deeply 
emarginate behind. The alveolar border is convex laterally and ven- 
trally, much as in Erignathus barbatus. The distance from the distal 
end of the intermaxillaries to the pterygoid hamuli is less than one- 
half the length of the skull, and from the same point to the anterior 
edge of the auditory bulhe is only 66 per cent, of the same length. The 
anterior nasal opening is elliptical, and corresponds closely to that of 
P.fcetida, but is higher in proportion to the breadth. The posterior 
nasal opening is about one-half broader than deep. The narial septum 
is nearly complete, the length of the whole " palate " being to the portion 
unoccupied as 66 to 10. The septum is, therefore, less developed than in 
P. grcenlandica, and more than in P.fcetida. The nasal bones are quite 
small, in length measuring less than one-fifth that of the skull ; their 
breadth anteriorly is approximately one-half their length. The anterior 
border has the shape of the letter W with equal limbs. 

Orbital region. — The zygomatic processes of the maxillary are broad, 
long, and very thin. The fossa beneath the infraorbital foramen is un- 
usually deep, but does not involve the zygomatic process so much as in 
P.fcetida. The temporal fossae are wide laterally. The zygomatic pro- 
cesses of the temporal bone are not so high as in P.fcetida, but resem- 
ble more closely those of P. grcenlandica. The interorbital " bridge" is 
intermediate in width between that of P. vitulina and P. fcetida. In the 
last-named species it is very narrow. The superorbital processes are 
rudimentary, but rather more developed than in other representatives 
of Phoca. 

Brain-case, superior and posterior surfaces. — The brain-case is large, 
its length almost exactly equaling one-half that of the skull. Its lou-

maxillary. This term is used with such looseuess that I regard it necessary to define it.

gitudinal aud transverse horizontal diameters are approximately equal. 
The convexity along tbe lines of the sagittal and coronal sutures is slight. 
The medial angle of the lambdoid suture is obtuse. The occipital makes 
an angle of about 45° with the base of the skull. The foramen magnum 
is an oblate ellipse. 

Brain-case, inferior surface. — The paroccipital processes are wide 
apart, more so than in any other species of the subfamily, the distance 
between them being about the same as that between the meati auditorii. 
They are more strongly developed than in P.fcetida, and less than in 
P. gramlandica. The auditory bullas are larger than those of any other 
seal with which I am acquainted. The anterior face is approximately 
at right angles to the main axis of the skull, and descends less perpen- 
dicularly than in other forms of the genus. The anterior extremity is 
obtuse, making the general outline rather more quadrilateral than tri- 
angular. The portion forming the inferior border of the meatus audi- 
torius is small, short, and convex, and is separated from the main por- 
tion of the bulla by a constriction, somewhat as in P. gramlandica and 
P.fcetida. 

Mandible. — The lower jaw is short and small. The rami are narrow 
vertically, and in the aged female are flattened internally. The coro- 
noid process is styloid, as in P.fcetida and gramlandica. 

The teeth. — The dental formula was correctly given by Von Schrenck, 

as follows : 

3-3 1-1 5-5 

I. 2-2 ; C. 1-1 ; M. 5-5. 

The internal incisor is the smallest, the outer the largest. The ca- 
nines are small. The molars, also, are small, and approximately equal 
in size, although the fifth, and especially the first, are a little smaller 
than the others. The form of the roots is subject to variation, as will 
appear from the subjoined table :

As I have not seen Von Schrenck's original account, I do not feel sat- 
isfied that he positively intended to affirm that the roots of the second 
premolars are bifurcate, although he is so interpreted by Allen.* 

From my examination of the skulls at hand I should be inclined to 
doubt that they are ever so. The form of the roots of the first true 
molar is such as to afford strong ground for a difference of opinion. 
There is invariably a longitudinal groove along the root, but the tip of 
the latter may or may not be sufficiently cleft to admit of the use of the 
term bifurcate. The posterior accessory cusps are apparent iu the supe- 
rior true molars, but almost or quite disappear from the premolars. The 
anterior accessory cusps are wanting superiorly. In the lower jaw both 
accessory cusps are traceable in all the grinding teeth, but are strongest 
in the true molars. The crowns of the premolars are considerably di- 
rected backward ; the true molars less so or not at all, although they 
bear that appearance when worn. The molars are SO placed in the ma- 
jority of specimens of both Histriophoca fasciata and Phoca vitulina that 
they rub against each other. This results in the obliteration of the an- 
terior accessory cusps of the superior molars when the teeth are worn. 

The skeleton; vertebral characters. — The vertebral formula is as fol- 
lows : O. 7 j D. 15 ; L. 5 ; S. 3 ; Ca. 14 = 44. The atlas is low and 
broad, with wide transverse processes. The axis is high, with a large 
and long odontoid process. The superior border of its neural spine is 
parallel with the long axis of the centrum. In Pusa it forms an angle 
of about 45° with that axis. All the processes of the remaining cervi- 
cal vertebras are short and stout. The low neural spines of the dorsal 
and lumbar vertebras are subequal in height, but increase in breadth 
(iu the anteroposterior direction) from the first backward. They are 
lowest at about the middle of the series. They do not bend backward 
so strongly as in Pusa. The kypapophysis becomes apparent in the 
thirteenth dorsal, and increases in size posteriorly, becoming strongest 
in the second lumbar. The transverse processes of the lumbar verte- 
brae increase slightly in length posteriorly and are subequal in breadth. 
Only the first two caudals have complete neural arches. The last 
twelve decrease in size very gradually posteriorly. 

The ribs and sternum. — The first rib is very broad and short, but less 
so than iu Pusa. The first thirteen have articular facets, but that of 
the twelfth is rudimentary, and does not reach the centrum. Nine are 
connected with the sternum, the first at the base of the first of the 
sternebras. In Pusa ten ribs reach the sternum. The sternum consists 
of nine sternebra?, the posterior, or ninth, nearly two and a half times 
the length of any of the others. The first is the smallest, somewhat 
conical, with the apex directed forward and compressed laterally; the 
others, except the ninth, are subequal. 

The scapula and pelvis. — The scapula is falciform, being prolonged

Vu, 



posteriorly, and is broader than high. The length is to the breadth as 
1 to 1.37. The pre-spinous region is broad interiorly. The spine is 
prominent and thin, and is abruptly truncated interiorly. * 
The coronoid process is rudimentary. 

The pelvis is long and narrow, being about three times as long as 
broad at the widest part. The crest of the ileum is turned abruptly 
outward, forming a deep and large cup-shaped fossa. This is consider- 
ably larger than in Pusa. The obturator foramen is elliptical and small, 
while the region of the pubic symphysis is long and broad. 

The fore and hind leys. — Both great and lesser 
tuberosities of the humerus are very strongly 
developed. The olecranon of the ulna is large, 
hamular, and broad in the anteroposterior direc- 
tion, with a large mammiform process externally. 
It is entirely distinct from the radius. The lat- 
ter is remarkably broad and flat at the inferior 
extremity. The bones of the carpus are very 
unequal in size; the magnum is very small ; the 
cuneiform is large, and so placed as to exclude 
articulation between the unciform and pisiform, 
while it articulates with the fifth metacarpal. 
The digits decrease in size gradually from the 
first to the fifth. The femur is short and broad, 
the great trochanter well developed and quad- 
rate. The tibia and fibula are auchylosed at 
the proximal extremity. The proportion of the 
length of the femur to that of the tibia is as 1 to 
2.28. All the fossa? are large and deep. 

In the tarsus the meso-cuneiform is the smallest 
The cuboid articulates about equally with 
the calcis and the astragalus. The digits are of unequal size ; they de- 
crease in length in the following order: First, fifth, second, fourth, 
third. The proportion of the length of the femur to that of the pes is 
as 1 to 3.06. The proportion of the length of the femur to that of the 
whole limb is as 1 to 0.38. The proportion of the length of the pes to 
that of the whole limb is as 1 to 1.92. It thus appears that the feet 
are large. The pelvis and tibia are of exactly equal length.

* Since the division of the inferior portions of the scapular spine into acromion and 
metacromion, by Mivart and other anatomists, it becomes somewhat difficult to ascer- 
tain whether one or both of the parts so called are present or absent. If the inferior 
termination of the scapular spine, however formed, is to be termed the acromion, 
then no scapulae can be said to lack the latter except those in which its entire upper 
margin describes a more or less uniform curve. In my preliminary diagnosis (Amer. 
Nat., xvii, 1883, 798) I stated that the scapular spine is without acromion. I still 
believe that this is a true statement, but not as generally understood.

ON THE SOURCE OF THE JAHEITE HU'I.ITIiaTS OF THE 
ALASKAN IHflVUITS. 

By E. W. NELSON. 

[Letter to Prof. Spencer F. Baird.] 

The numerous specimens of jade or jacleite implements obtained by 
myself and others from the Alaskan Innuits have been secured mainly 
between the head of Norton Sound, in Bering Sea, and Point Barrow, 
on the Arctic coast. They arc found most abundantly among the peo- 
ple inhabiting the lower courses of the large streams flowing into Kotze- 
bue Sound. Owing to the hostile character of the natives and for other 
reasons I never penetrated this region, but met and interrogated num- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 427 

erous intelligent Innuits who lived in that district, and from whom I 
bought various jade articles. These people all agreed in the statement 
that the jade occurs on the side of a steep hill or mountain slope de- 
scending to one of the rivers, and each described its occurrence only 
along what appeared from their descriptions to be a well-marked vein, 
or perhaps a dike, extending from the water to the crest of the bill. 

Jade celts also occur among the Indians of the Yukon about Nulato. 
They claim that the rough material is found upon the side of a mountain 
about 2o miles from Nulato. This is the same range in which the pre- 
vious locality is situated. The Point Barrow Innuits hunt reindeer and 
mountain sheep along the northern border of these mountains, and un- 
doubtedly obtain their crude material there. The same material is 
found in the mountains on the western part of the Kaviak Peninsula 
near Bering Strait. The Innuits of that district know it well and 
have many implements made from it. All I questioned as to the local- 
ity of this stone pointed to the mountains in the immediate vicinity. 
From Norton Sound south along the Alaskan coast to the vicinity of 
Bristol Bay this stone is almost or quite unknown among the Innuits, 
as I found when traveling among them ; but the fine specimens recently 
received from Mr. McKay, at Bristol Bay, show conclusively that there 
must be another locality in that district where jade occurs in place. 

That small water- worn fragments are very frequently used by the na- 
tives for celts, &c, is undoubtedly true, but that these fragments come 
from some point where the stone occurs as a part or whole of a vein is at 
least very probable, as shown by the Innuit description of the Kotzebue 
Sound locality. The Innuits call it a " fire-stone," and say it was made 
in a very hot fire when some of the volcanic cones of their mountains 
were in a state of eruption. On the Siberian shore of Bering Strait 
only a very few jade fragments were seen by me, and their owners all 
claimed to have obtained them on the American side.

ON Till: ORIGIN OF THE FOSSIE KOMM DISCOVERED IN THE 
VICINITY OF TIME'S FORD, FLORIDA. 

By S. T. WALKER. 

[Letter to Prof. Spencer F. Baird. ] 

The day after I wrote to you from Fort Ogden, on Peace Creek, I pro- 
cured a small skiff, and the services of two strong negroes to row it, 
and proceeded up the river in search of Tise's Ford, which I was informed 
was 17 miles by the river and 8 miles by land. The rainy season hav- 
ing set in, the river was slightly swollen, and rising, which produced 
a considerable current increasing in strength as we ascended until 
rowing became quite a labor. The shores of the river were bold for 



428 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

this region, and were clothed with a magnificent growth of cypress, 
oak, and hickory trees, though at all points examined by me the high 
shores sloped rapidly away to low, wet swamps. About 7 miles (by the 
river) above Fort Ogden I met the first indications of fossil bones. On 
a low point, where the river makes a sudden bend, lay a small bed of 
gravel interspersed with innumerable fragments of bones, bits of turtle 
shell, &c, still retaining their bony structure, and in no way changed or 
petrified. From this point onward every sand-bar had its bed of gravel 
with similar fragments of bone, bits of deer's horns, and turtle shell. 
Each successive sand-bar held large pieces, and I vainly examined 
bluffs for some indication of the fossils in situ. Shark's teeth (quite small) 
with the enamel unbroken were quite plentiful. The bluffs were com- 
posed of white or yellow sand, overlying patches of grayish clay, soft 
sandstone rocks, or very soft limestone. The sand only was continu- 
ous, the clay and soft rocks cropping out here and there. As we as- 
cended the stream uarrowed aud the cur ent was so swift that we could 
not make more than a mile and a half an hour. There being no houses 
on the river, excepting at the ferries, we could make no inquiries. At 
the first ferry, 3 miles above Fort Ogden, they had never heard of Tise's 
Ford. At the second, the ferryman iuformedus that there are two fords 
of that name, one 8 miles above and the other 4 miles below; that bones 
could be fouud on all the bars and along the shores almost anywhere, but 
that they were more plentiful at Gardner's Bluffs, 5 miles above, and at 
Tise's Ford, 4 miles below, than any where else. The river seeming to have 
very little current above this ferry, I determined to push on to the upper 
ford. It was now 5 o'clock in the afternoon and my crew showed signs of 
rebellion, but finally agreed to pull to Gardner's Bluffs, which we reached 
about sundown. Here I found a bed of gravel 10 inches thick, which 
seemed to extend under the bluff. The gravel and fragments of bone 
seemed to be very slightly waterworn, their angles in many instances 
appearing quite sharp. At this jdace a small stream emptied into the 
river. Between the river and the brook the banks were 10 feet high, 
and 1 had the satisfaction of finding that the stratum of gravel extended 
quite through to the little brook. Here my men positive^ refused to 
proceed, so I determined to leave them and proceed alone, as the mos- 
quitoes gave little to be hoped for in the way of sleep during the night. 
I ordered them to dig in the bluff the next day, and to save all objects 
of interest they might find, and taking the boat I began the ascent 
alone. I pulled steadily until 2 o'clock, when, overcome with fatigue, 
I lay down in the boat and fought the mosquitoes until day. The next 
morning I dropped down the river leisurely, examining every sand-bar 
and bluff, and following several small streams half a mile up on foot, 
without finding the mysterious source of this bone supply. When I got 
back I found my men digging like heroes, each of them having his 
pockets stuffed with lumps of iron pyrites, which they fondly imagined 
to be gold. I kept my counsel for the present, and suffered the rebels 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 429 

to dig until I found there was no prospect of unearthing a complete 
bone, much less a skeleton, when I stopped them and began the return, 
which was rapid and easy. On reaching Tise's Ford I made a thorough 
examination of that locality. In a cut-off or old river-bed I found a 
vast number of fragments of huge bones, but none entire except one 
small vertebra, which I send you. My opinion is that the bones are 
washed up from the bottom of the river during high water, as I failed to 
find the slightest evidence of any fossils in the clays. The bed of gravel 
at Gardner's Bluffs I think was deposited in ancient times by the river. 
I am induced to think thus because at Fort Meade and other places 
above they dig up sharks' teeth, turtles, and bones in wells at the depth 
of 18 and 20 feet.

Request for Specimens of Drugs and Information Concern- 
ing them. 

Dear Sir: 

The accompanying method of arrangement and list of specimens 
has been prepared to show the present condition of the materia medica 
section of the U. S. National Museum. 

The deficiencies of the collection are made evident by this exhibi 
tion of its possessions. 

The Museum will be pleased to receive specimens of drugs, and 
their natural and commercial varieties, which do not appear by name in 
the catalogue. Contributions will be properly accredited to the donors 
on the labels. 

Information regarding the source, habitat, mode of production, 
physical peculiarities, and history of any specimen, will add much to 
its value. 

For the collection, as at present constituted, the Museum is largely 
indebted to the generosity of a few of the principal wholesale druggists 
of the country, notably W. H. Schieffelin & Co , New York, McKesson & 
Bobbins, New York, Parke, Davis & Co., Detroit, and Wallace Brothers, 
Statesville, N. C. It is hoped that other firms, and individuals as well, 
who may have or receive drugs or varieties not represented in our 
list, will feel sufficient interest in this national collection to contribute 
toward its completeness. 
Verv respectfully, 

SPENCER F. BAIRD, 

Director.

CIRCULAR RELATIVE TO CONTRIHUTIONS OF ABORIGINAL AN- 

TIQUITIES TO THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL. Ilisi:rtl. 

By CHARLES RAIT, 

Curator of the Department of Antiquities, United States National Museum. 

It happens very frequently that the National Museum receives ab- 
original relics unaccompanied by exact statements as to the locality, or 
localities, where they were found, and by notices explaining under what 
circumstances they occurred. Such information, however, is very de- 
sirable, not only for the sake of accuracy, but also because in many 
cases a communication of the details of the discovery will either con- 
firm former observations, or present new facts, and thus serve to in- 
crease archaeological knowledge. For this reason it has been thought 
proper to prepare this circular as a guidance to those who contribute 
antiquities to the National Museum. 

The relics in question occur either on or below the surface, as stray 
specimens unconnected with any other tokens of aboriginal occupancy, or 
in drift-beds, in open-air workshops, in quarries and mines, as caches or 
deposits, on the sites of camping-grounds, villages,- and forts, in shell- 
heaps, caves (natural or artificial), graves, mounds and earthworks 
generally, and in or near ruined buildings of aboriginal origin. 

In every instance the locality should be distinctly specified. County and 
State or Territory, of course, are to be mentioned, and, in addition, the dis- 
tance and direction {north, south, northwest, <&c.) from the next town, and, 
if the place is near a creek, river, lake, or the sea-coast, or a hill or mount- 
ain, it should be stated, and the distance and direction indicated. In un- 
inhabited or sparsely -populated parts of the country, the topographic features 
tcill suffice to denote the locality. 

As for the accompanying notices concerning the finding of specimens, 
the following brief suggestions are offered : 

Surface-finds.— It is desirable to learn whether the objects were found 
on or below the surface, and, in the latter case, how deeply they were 
imbedded ; also, whether specimens of the same kind or of different 
character have occurred in the neighborhood 

(479) 



480 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Drift-beds. — Elide stone implements and bones of animals have been 
taken in the United States from quaternary beds of gravel and sand. 
In view of tbe important bearing of such implements on the antiquity 
of man in this country, the locality should be thoroughly studied by a 
competent geologist, and all details of the discovery minutely noted. 

Open-air Workshops. — There are innumerable places where the aborigi- 
nes manufactured stone implements and weapons. They can easily be 
recognized by the accumulation of chips of stone, and by the presence 
of unfinished arrow and spear-heads, &c, which were thrown away on 
account of some defect in the stone or failure in working it. A collec- 
tion from such a locality should embrace specimens of the raw material, 
chips, and implements in all stages of manufacture; also the tools used 
in breaking the stone. 

Quarries and Mines. — Of late years places have been discovered in 
various parts of the United States, where the aborigines had quarried 
potstone, often called soapstone, a substance extensively used by them 
in the manufacture of vessels, pipes, and other articles. The vessels 
generally received their rudimentary form in the quarries, as numerous 
examples found in them testify. The rude tools used in detaching and 
fashioning the material also occur in these localities. The explorer 
should describe the situation, extent, and character of the diggings, 
and collect pieces of the raw material as well as specimens of the un- 
finished potstone ware and every implement he finds. A plan of the 
locality is desirable. 

Similar rules hold good for the places to which the indigenes resorted 
for the purpose of digging for flint, mica, and other mineral substances. 
Their exploitation of native copper seems to have been confined to the 
Lake Superior district. 

Caches or Deposits. — Underground deposits of stone implements are 
of frequent occurrence in the United States. These relics, usually 
chipped from flinty material, often present leaf-shaped or spear-head- 
like forms, and there is generally some symmetry in their arrangement. 
It is to be noted how deep the deposit was buried, how far it extended 
horizontally and downward, and in what manner the specimens com- 
posing it were placed. Their number should be stated. Deposits of 
stoue objects not pertaining to the classes here mentioned have likewise 
been found. 

Camping-grounds. — Usually situated near running water, and recog- 
nizable by scattered implements of stone and bone, fragments of earthen 
vessels, and the refuse of meals. The spots where the cooking was 
done can sometimes be identified by rude stoue hearths. Flint tmple- 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 481 

ments were often manufactured in these places. Specimens of every 
description (animal remains included) should be collected, and the con- 
figuration of the ground described. The addition of a plan of the lo- 
cality will prove useful in many cases. 

Village-sites. — They have many features in common with the camp- 
ing-grounds, and the preceding remarks are fully applicable to them. 
The places formerly occupied by habitations can often be distinguished 
by the so-called hut-rings, by excavations, &c, and, as many villages 
were fortified by embankments or pickets, or by both, their traces have 
to be sought for. The former existence of pickets is sometimes indicated 
by rows of holes in the ground. A collection from a village site should 
be accompanied by a plan of the same. 

Forts. — The aborigines often fortified places affording special facilities 
for defense by building walls of earth or stone. Such localities have 
frequently yielded numerous relics left by the occupants, and they de- 
serve the attention of collectors. To the description of a fort should be 
added a plan showing its character and surroundings. 

Shell-heaps. — These accumulations mark the places to which the ab- 
origines resorted for catching and consuming mollusks, fish, &c. They 
occur on the sea-shore as well as on the banks of rivers, and are, there- 
fore, chiefly composed either of marine or fluviatile shells. Among 
them are found, sometimes in great number, implements of stone and 
bone, fragments of pottery, and animal remains. Also sometimes rude 
stone hearths surrounded by charcoal and ashes. The manufacture of 
flint implements was often carried on in these places. A collection from 
a shell-heap should contain characteristic specimens of every kind of 
manufacture there found ; a full series of the species of shells, and all 
obtainable remains of reptiles, fishes, birds, and quadrupeds (skulls t 
bones, teeth, shells of turtles, &c). The explorer should refer in his 
account to the situation, extent, thickness, and composition of the heap, 
and also state whether it is of a homogeneous character throughout, or 
consists of various layers differing in the nature of their contents. 

Caves. — Real caves, as well as recesses formed bj- overhanging rocks, 
were often used by the indigenes of jSorth America as places of refuge 
or temporary habitations, and such retreats generallj' contain abundant 
tokens of their occupancy. It is advisable to collect all implements, 
sherds, bones, &c, exposed on the surface of the floor; and if the latter 
reaches downward, in consequence of accumulation, it should be en. 
tirely removed in sections, its stratification (if there is any) carefully 
noted, and the relative position of each discovered object recorded. A 
ground-plan and section will serve to render the description of such a 
locality more intelligible. 

Proc. Nat. Mus. 83 31 



482 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

Some caves were used as burial-places. The human remains, together 
■with the objects accompanying them, ought to he carefully preserved, 
and every fact calculated to throw light on the mode of burial carefully 
noted.* 

Graves. — Various modes of interment were in use among the North 
American indigenes, and the graves are either isolated or grouped to- 
gether, forming cemeteries. The so-called stone-graves — rude cists con- 
structed of stone-slabs — usually occur as such. Other graves are mere 
pits, in which the dead were buried in a squatting posture, and there 
are ossuaries containing the bones of many individuals brought together 
for final burial. 

The explorer will do well to note every circumstance relating to the 
situation, form, dimensions, and direction of the grave or graves. It is 
important to know whether the body was stretched out or doubled up, 
and in the former case it should be stated what point of the compass 
the head faced. It also has to be ascertained, if possible, whether the 
body (or bodies) or only the bones were buried. In some graves the 
latter are promiscuously mingled. If, as is often the case, manufact- 
ured objects — such as implements, ornaments, earthenware, &c. — were 
lurried with the body, their position with regard to the latter ought to 
l>e ascertained before they are removed. The presence of manufactures 
derived from the whites (glass beads, objects of iron or brass, &c.) de- 
notes, of course, that the interment took place after the colonization of 
the country. 

The explorer, it hardly need be said, should collect the human re- 
mains and all articles found with them. 

Mounds. — Many of the mounds scattered over a large portion of the 
United States are of a sepulchral character, and these differ much in 
form, size, and the disposition of their contents. The shape and dimen- 
sions of the mound to be explored have to be ascertained by careful 
measurement, and, if it belongs to a group, its relation to neighboring 
mounds, embankments, &c, shown in a plan, which should be made as 
correct as circumstances permit. In such a case a regular survey alone 
will satisfy the requirements of absolute accuracy. The ordinary method 
■of opening a mound consists in sinking a square shaft of suitable dimen- 
sions from the apex to the bottom, as the human remains and their ac- 
companiments are usually found in the centre on a level with the origi- 
nal surface of the soil, and sometimes even below it. They constitute 
the primary burial, which caused the erection of the mound; but many 
mounds, more especially large ones, served for later or secondary burials, 
the body usually being deposited a short distance below the apex or in the 

* There have lately been discovered in New Mexico artificial caves or chambers 
scooped out in rows in mountain-sides. They served as dwellings. Details will soon 
ibe published by the Bureau of Ethnology. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 483 

side of the mound.* While sinking the shaft, the explorer has to notice 
the nature of the material composing the mound, and when he reaches 
the mortuary deposit, he will have to record all details which determine 
its character. The body was sometimes placed in a stone cist or a rude 
timber frame- work, which is now decayed, but has left its impression in 
the surrounding earth. In other instances the body was burned, and 
the mound contains only its calcined bones. Mounds have been opened 
which inclosed the remains of several or many individuals. Some show 
a stratification, being composed of alternating layers of pebbles, gravel, 
sand, earth, &c, which are not horizontal, but conform to the convex 
outline of the mound. Of such character are many of the so-called sacri- 
ficial mounds, which often inclose hearths of burned clay, serving as the 
receptacles of various articles more or less changed by the action of fire. 
This stratification has also been noticed in real burial mounds. 

The diversity in the inner structure of mounds is very great, and the 
mode of proceeding in opening one must be left to the intelligence of the 
explorer. A vertical section should always accompany the description 
of a mound. — Whenever feasible, a mound should have its excavation 
filled up, in order to be restored to its original shape. 

Earthioorks. — A search for relics within earthworks, and in their 
neighborhood, has frequently proved successful. Nothing short of a 
geometrical survey will fully illustrate the character of such works. 

Ruins. — The ruined buildings, cliff-dwellings, &c, in the southwest- 
ern part of this country, which have of late years attracted so much at- 
tention, are being carefully studied and surveyed under the auspices of 
the Bureau of Ethnology. Only the systematized efforts of exploring 
parties are adequate to the accomplishment of a work of such magni- 
tude. 

This circular, of course, is primarily designed for collectors in the 
United States ; but, with proper modifications, it may prove serviceable 
to contributors north and south of this country.

* There are sometimes sent to the National Museum specimens described as coming

formation is insufficient. It should be clearly stated whether the object pertained to 
.a primary or secondary burial, and in either case its relation to human remains or other 
articles with which it was found associated has to be indicated.

BRIEF DIRECTIONS FOR RE9IOTIIVG AND PRESERVIIVGTHE SKINS 

OF II AH1I A I*. 

By WM. T. II O It VI D A Y, 

Chief Taxidermist, National Museum. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 

It is a simple matter to prepare the skin of an ordinary quadruped, 
provided the operator is not afraid of getting a little blood on his hands, 
and is not naturally indisposed to physical exertioD. A few minutes' 
work suffices for the skin of a small mammal, and a few hours for a 
large one, up to the size of a buffalo. With a sharp knife, detailed in- 
structions, some cheap preservatives, and a little patient labor the thing 
is done. One specimen properly prepared in the field is worth ten that 
have been slighted. 

The great principle, which is the foundation of all valuable field work 
on mammal skins, is this : A shin must be so taken off, cleaned of flesh, 
and preserved that the preservative poivder or fluid can act directly upon 
the roots of the hair from the inner side of the shin and over every por- 
tion of its surface. Neither alum, nor salt, nor alcohol (unless it be of 
great strength) can strike through a thick layer of flesh and penetrate 
through the skin to the epidermis quickly enough to save it from decom- 
position. The epidermis of most animals is of such a close and oily 
nature that preservatives cannot strike through it from without, and 
therefore when a skin is removed it must be cleaned of flesh and fat, so 
that the preservative liquid or dry powder can come immediately iu con- 
tact with the cutis. 

SELECTION OF SPECIMENS. 

When specimens are sufficiently numerous to allow of a choice of in- 
dividuals for preservation, select first the finest, largest, and most per- 
fect old male and female. Young animals of every kind are very desir- 
able, and specimens should be taken whenever possible. Of animals 

(485) 



486 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL . MUSEUM. 

that are known, or even supposed, to be rare, preserve the first specimen 
obtained, be it young or old, good, bad, or indifferent, for fear another . 
of the same species is not obtained. 

NOTES AND MEASUREMENTS. 

The value of a specimen is greatly enhanced by a record of the fol- 
lowing: 1. Length of head and body; 2. Length of tail; 3. Height at 
shoulders (if the animal be a large one) and girth ; 4. Color of eyes; 
and 5. Color of other soft parts of the head, feet, and body which are in 
any way worthy of notice. Sketches and photographs of animals in 
the flesh, either dead or alive, are always highly prized by zoologists 
and taxidermists, to whom they are of the utmost importance and 
value. 

KNIVES AND MATERIALS. 

For small quadrupeds a good sharp pocket-knife is enough for any one 
who does not make a business of collecting, and for large animals small 
butcher or hunting knives are amply sufficient. Alcohol in copper cans 
with large screw tops are supplied by the Institution by special arrange- 
ment, but salt and alum with which to make a better solution, can be 
procured anywhere within the pale of civilization, and also kegs or bar- 
rels to put it in. Any one who really wishes to preserve the skin of an 
animal need never be thwarted by an apparent lack of implements and 
preservatives. 

SKINNING SMALL QUADRUPEDS (VARYING IN SIZE FROM A MOUSE TO 

A MASTIFF). 

Lay the animal flat upon its back, and, beginning at the throat, 
make a straight, clean cut in the skin along the middle of the neck, 
breast, and abdomen, quite to the base of the tail. Except in very 
small animals the tail also must be slit open along the under side from 
about one inch above the root quite to the tip. 

The bottom of the foot must be slit open lengthwise, from the base of 
the middle toe to the heel. All the opening cuts in the skin are now 
made. 

Begin at the middle of the abdomen, and cut the skin neatly from the 
body, leaving no flesh, or at least but very little, adhering to it. We come 
very soon to where the fore leg joins the body at the shoulder, and the 
hind leg at the hip. Cut through the muscles at those points, disjoint 
the legs, and detach them entirely from the body. 

Skin each leg by turning the skin wrong side out over the foot, quite 
down to the toes. When this has been done, cut the flesh away from 
the bones of the leg and foot, but be careful to leave the bones attached 
to each other by their natural ligaments, and to the skin itself at the 
toes. Never throw away the leg bones of an animal if the skin is to be

mounted, but leave them attached to the skin as shown by the left leg of 
the accompanying figure.* 




fci/faASqei 



SQUIRRKL PARTLY SKINNED. 

Detach the skin from the back, shoulders, and neck, and when you 
come to the ears cut them off close to the head. Turn the skin wrong 
side out over the head and proceed until you come to the eyes. Now 
work slowly with the knife, keeping close to the edge of the bony orbit r 
until you can see, through a thin membrane under your knife edge, the 
dark portion of the eye. You may now cut fearlessly through this 
membrane and expose the eyeball. It is a good plan with large mam- 
mals to hold "one finger of the left hand in the eye and cut against it to> 
avoid cutting the lid. 

Skin down to the end of the nose, cut through the cartilage close to 
the bone, and cut on down to where the upper lip joins the gum. Cut 
both lips away from the skull close to the bone all the way around the 
mouth, except directly in front of the incisors. 

The lips are thick and fleshy, and must be split open from the inside

author to illustrate a forthcoming work on taxidermy. 



488 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 




and flattened out so that the flesh in them can be pared off". Do not 
cut off the roots of the whiskers, or they will fall out. Pare away the 
membrane which adheres to the inside of the eye- 
lids and turn the ear wrong side out at the base 
in order to cut away the flesh around it. 

If the ears have hair upon them they must 
be skinned up from the iuside and turned wrong 
side out quite to the tip, in order to separate the outside skin, which 
holds the hair, from the cartilage which supports the ear. 

To clean the skull, cut the flesh all off the cranium, cut out the eyes 
and tongue, and Avith a bent wire, or a spoon-handle bent up at the end, 
draw out the brain through the occipital opening at the back of the skull. 
By this time the skin will most surely have become bloody in several 
places, and before applying any preservative it must be washed per- 
fectly clean. Blood left upon the hair imparts to it a lasting stain, and 
usually causes the hair to come off in mounting. 

SKINNING LARGE MAMMALS. 

The principal difference between the manner of skinning a small ter- 
restrial quadruped and a large one, like a bear, deer, or buffalo, is that 

the skin of each leg is slit open 
from the bottom of the foot up 
the back of the leg nearly the 
first joint and from thence up 
the inside of the leg, following 
to the lines of the accompanying 
figure, until it meets the opening 
cut which has been made along 
the center of the body. In pre- 
paring a skin as large as that of 
a buffalo or large polar bear, it 
is best to cut off the leg bones at 
the first joint above the foot, tie 
them up in a 
bundle with 
theskull,and 
foricard them with the sMn, properly labeled. 

In skinning the head of an animal having horns, 
it is necessary to make an opening at the back of ( 
the neck. Make the cuts as shown by the dotted 
lines of the accompanying figure, cut completely 
around each horn at the base, and skin the head by 
working downward over the forehead and the cheeks. The head skin 
of a large mammal is the most difficult part to remove and preserve 
successfully, and therefore the greatest care is necessary in its prepa- 
ration. 





PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 489 
PRESERVATION OF SKINS. 

1. In a temperate climate. The old and familiar method is to rub the 
skins inside with powdered alum or dry arsenic, or alum and saltpeter, 
wrap tow around the leg bones (of small mammals), and dry the skins. 
Let me here call the attention of all collectors to the following fact: 

A mammal skin ivhich has never been dried and hardened can be mounted 
in one-third less time and icith far greater accuracy than the best dry shin 
of the same Mud. 

This being the case, it is certainly worth while to preserve skins in a 
soft state. A skin may be removed very unskillfully, but if kept soft 
until it reaches the taxidermist, it can be mounted with gratifying suc- 
cess. On the other hand, the dry skins of the most experienced col- 
lector can be mounted well only with great difficulty. 

The following methods are recommended: 

Under ordinary circumstances, in a temperate climate a skin may be 
preserved in a soft state by rubbing salt very thoroughly on the in- 
side, and then leaving the skin turned wrong side out, packing it in 
salt, and shipping it in that condition as soon as possible. A better 
method, or rather the best of all methods for any climate, and all kinds of 
xkins, is to prepare a solution of salt and alum in water in the following 
proportions: For every gallon of water put in one pint of alum (three- 
fourths of a pound) and one quart of salt (one pound and three-fourths), 
stir it up, and heat it to the boiling point. Pour it into a wooden or 
earthen vessel, and when cool, or milk warm, it is ready for use. Plunge 
a skin into this bath and move it about until the' solution reaches 
every part. Give a fresh skin plenty of room for the first day or two, 
and if it be a large one move it about every day for three days so that 
the solution can act with full force on every part. 

Fresh skins of all kinds may be placed in this bath (leg bones and 
skull of small skins may also be left attached) and allowed to remain in 
it for months without deteriorating in any way ; even after five years 
they are still as soft and pliable as when first taken off. Small skins 
may be shipped in glass jars, or wooden kegs, and large ones in barrels. 

If you have alcohol sufficiently strong (30° above proof), skins may be 
immersed in it as fast as collected, instead of iu the salt and alum solu- 
tion. The objections to alcohol are that it loses strength very rapidly 
when receiving daily accessions of fresh skins, bleaches hair, and must 
be renewed from time to time until the collection is finally packed in 
fresh alcohol and shipped. 

2. In an arctic climate. As before stated, the salt and alum solution 
is the best preservative for skins in all climates, and for all objects from 
the largest elephant, seal, walrus, or polar bear, down to the smallest 
bat of the tropics. If it is impossible or impracticable to employ it, the 
skins of all large arctic mammals may be successfully preserved by im- 
mersing them in very strong brine, but it should be renewed at least 



490 PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 

once or twice The skins of seals and small mammals may be simply 
packed in salt. 

3. In a tropical climate. Skins cannot be preserved with salt in a 
tropical climate, but must be immersed either in the salt and alum solu- 
tion, or alcohol, or else dried. Drying skins in the tropics is extremely 
difficult to accomplish successfully, and should be adopted only as a last 
resort. It may be accomplished as follows : Alter removing and clean- 
ing a skin, apply arsenical soap to the inside; then rub on powdered 
alum, very freely, over every portion. The safest and surest plan is to 
leave the skin turned wrong side out, but skins so prepared are rather 
unsightly objects, and unfit even for study until relaxed and turned 
light side out. The neatest way is to wrap a little tow, oakum, rags, or 
even paper around the leg bones, turn the skin back over them, put a 
little loose filling in the head and body, and take a few stitches in the 
skin to hold it in shape. Do not put the skull back in the shin, but tie it to 
one of the fore legs. Comb the hair neatly, put arsenical soap and alum 
on the palms, face, and ears, and hang the skin up to dry in the shade y 
where the air will circulate freely around it. 

SPECIMENS IN THE FLESH. 

The most valuable of all specimens which come to us are those sent in 
the flesh. A rare animal so received is sometimes cast in plaster, skinned, 
dissected, skeletonized, and portions of the viscera preserved in spirits 
for pathological study. In this way a single subject is often made to 
yield a number of valuable scientific preparations. The institution will 
be very glad to receive the dead body of any foreign animal which may 
die in the Eastern United States, and also any rare or especially fine 
American species. 

FORWARDING ANIMALS IN THE FLESH. 

In cold weather, particularly from December 1 to March 1, a dead, 
animal may safely be sent (frozen) from as far west as the Koeky 
Mountains. In the cool month of November and March specimens may 
safely be forwarded from points five hundred miles distant. From May 
to October animals should be disemboweled and packed in ice when 
sent from points more than twelve hours by rail from Washington. 

Large animals with thick hair, such as deer, elk, moose, bear, &c. f 
can be sent without boxing, but it will be well to sew them up in coarse 
sacking to protect the hair. Small animals and others with close hair, 
such as the zebra, lion, tiger, or giraffe should be boxed and packed in 
straw or shavings to protect the hair from being rubbed off. Animals 
of the largest size, such as rhinoceros, elephant, or hippopotamus must 
be skinned and skeletonized where they die by our own preparators, 
who hold themselves in readiness to start at once for any point on the. 
receipt of telegraphic information. 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 491 

The Smithsonian Institution will pay all charges for boxing and cart- 
age upon presentation of vouchers in regular form, and all freight and 
express charges will be met here. As a rule, dead animals should al- 
ways be sent by express, the exceptions being in the cases of large ani- 
mals forwarded from a great distance in the middle of winter, when they 
could as safely come by freight. 

All donations are promptly acknowledged by the director of the Mu- 
seum, both by letter and in his annual report, and the names of donors 
also appear in the catalogues, and upon the large printed labels attached 
to their specimens in the exhibition cases. 

TRANSPORTATION. 

Specimens should be very securely packed previous to shipment, and 
plainly addressed as follows : " Smithsonian Institution, Washington, B. 
C. : for the National Museum. Perishable." Shipments may be for- 
warded by Government vessels when available, or by the ordinary lines 
of transportation &t the expense of the institution. 

In case immediate information or instructions are required in rela- 
tion to any dead animal of special importance, which is at the disposal

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAKIIVO PAPER ISOLDS OF INSCRIPTIONS IN 

STONE, WOOD, RRONZE. ETC. 

Prepared by Ensign A. P. IMBLAfK, U. S. W.* 



I. — MATERIALS. 

Three grades of paper, cut in sheets convenient for handling, and 
rolled for packing or transportation ; several pounds of starch ; several 
ounces of alum ; Cooper's white glue (one-fourth pound to one pound 
of starch) ; boiled linseed or fat oil ; essence of turpentine ; yellow wax ; 
pieces of thick pasteboard, or wooden blocks. Boards, scantling, canvas, 
nails, hammer, sand, &c, as explained in Sections III and V, and 
depending on circumstances. 

II. — TOOLS AND ACCESSORIES. 

Paste brush, similar to white- wash brush; ordinary paintbrush, for 
applying hardening mixture; large, flat, coir or grass brush with handle 
similar to that of an ordinary hair brush; small, stiff, paint brush (the 
two latter will be designated "large" and "small" brush, respectively; 
they are to be used in beating or " stippling" the paper in obtaining an 
impression); sponge; large pair of shears; spatula, or modeler's knife - r 
pans, pots, &c, for holding water, boiling paste and hardening mixture r 
heating sand, &c. 

III. — NOTES ON MATERIALS. 

Paper, for this purpose, should be unsized, and what may be called 
malleable, that is, when wet and beaten or stippled with a hard brush it

should yield or stretch locally and to a considerable depth without tear- 
ing. A coarse fibrous paper of this kiud can be used in case nothing 
better is at hand, or coarse paper may be used as a backing or stiffener 
to paper of a finer quality. Coarse, thick, fibrous paper is apt to wrinkle 
and .show the fibers in the surface of the plaster reproduction or cast. 
A quality of paper used by M. Desire Charnay in Central America and 
Mexico, and which may answer for all American inscriptions (which 
are seldom carved in fine lines), may be obtained from the firm of Batalla 
and Blain, commission merchants, No. 7, Rue Joliette, Marseilles, 
France. 

What may be specified as the first grade, of the three grades of paper 
spoken of under " Materials," is any of the thicker, coarser grades of 
paper for use on lar^e, massive inscriptions, having coarse lines and a 
rugged surface. The paper must possess sufficient malleability to en- 
able it to reach the deepest cuts or crevices. All paper should be tested 
before taking it into the field. Paper for the foregoing purposes is here 
designated, for convenience, No. 1. 

The smooth, thin, American, stereotyping paper, used for the matrices 
of our daily newspapers, is here designated No. 2. It is best for smooth 
surfaces, finer lines, and deeper cuts. 

For fine inscriptions in bronze, wood, or stone, or for plaster repro- 
ductions of hieroglyphics, &c, and for smooth unpolished surfaces and 
sharp relief figures with fine lines (without, of course, the refinement 
of hair or microscopic lines), American tissue paper may be used to form 
the inner surface of the mold. The more expensive French cream tissue 
paper, used in the best stereotyping, will of course give correspondingly 
better results. Tissue paper is here designated No. 3. 

The paste here recommended is made as follows: Mix starch in hot 
water till the solution is thick ; dissolve the white glue in hot water, 
one-fourth pound to one pound of starch ; pour the glue in the starch, 
stir well ; put on the fire and boil. As a preservative when large quan- 
tities are made, or in hot climates, stir in one teaspoonful of alum to 
the quart of paste. One minute after the mixture bubbles take it off. 

Plain flour or starch paste might answer, but the glue prevents the 
blistering of the molds so likely to occur in transportation. 

The hardening and water-proofing mixture Is made as follows : 

Boiled linseed oil or fat oil - . 3 parts. 

Essence of turpentine 1 part. 

Yellow wax 1 part. 

Boil, stir well, and apply boiling hot, as described hereafter. 

IV. — NOTES ON INSCRIPTIONS. 

This process will not answer for statues or figures in bold relief. 
Before taking the mold it is well to make all notes which can possibly 
add to the anthropological value of the work. Locate the inscription 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 495 

as accurately on a chart as the instruments at hand will admit; or lati- 
tude and longitude may he given, or hearings from prominent physical 
or geographical points may he taken. Give as accurately as possible the 
bearing of the planes of the inscriptions or different walls. Sketch 
each wall or inscription as a guide in putting the parts of the mold 
together. Make notes on the nature of the rock : whether the wall is 
natural or artificial, excavated or above ground ; color of stone. »S:c. Pro- 
cure a specimen of the rock, if possible. If an artistic reproduction 
is aimed at, notes and sketches of discolorations, fungus growth, vines, 
&c, should be made. Or a photograph of the inscription should he 
taken, if possible, with a scale of inches for reference, care being taken 
to have the plane of the scale and the plane of the negative parallel to 
that of the inscription. The scale should stand against the inscription. 
Preparatory to taking a mold, clean off the surface of the stone or in- 
scription with a modeler's knife or scrapers. 

A\ here the inscription can be covered with one sheet of paper, the 
sheets are laid simply one over the other to the thickness of four or five, 
the alternate sheets being crossed to cross the fibers in the paper. 
Where the surface is large, as supposed in what follows, the sheets are 
shingled on, so to speak, but commencing always at the top of the in- 
scription. Where No. 3 paper is used it is best to paste three or four 
thicknesses of it on sheets of No. 2, being careful not to put it on 
wrinkled. Sheets thus prepared are used only for the first course or 
layer, with the tissue paper in contact with the inscription. The other 
courses are Xo. 1 or Jso. 2 paper, as desired. 

The following process is suggested for large inscriptions and with the 
facilities assumed in this paper. Special variations must be made to 
suit the materials at hand, the climate, nature of inscription, &c. : 

V. — TAKING THE MOLD. 

Soak each sheet of paper in water for about three minutes or more, 
or until pliable, and put it unwrinkled on the face of the inscription; 
commencing at the top, stipple it firmly and methodically with the 
large brush until the paper reaches the bottom of the deepest cuts. 
Water should be applied with a sponge from time to time. For nar- 
row or small circular cuts use the small brush. Apply a thin coat of 
paste to this sheet, being careful never to get any on the surface of the 
inscription. Xow apply the second sheet, wet also, always in the same 
course, if there is room, or below the first sheet if there is only one 
sheet in the first course. This second sheet should in any (rase overlap 
or cover two-thirds of the first. Stipple it, apply paste, and a third 
sheet, overlapping two-thirds, and stippling as before. Proceed thus 
until the entire inscription is covered. This will give three thick- 
nesses of paper over nearly all the inscription. Mend the torn places, 
where the paper has failed, by applying wet pieces and beating them 
in. In all deep cuts fill in with strips of pasteboard till solid, or cut out 
blocks of light wood to fit in flush. They should be glued in, and fur-

ther secured by strips of paper pasted across them, securing them to 
the mold. These filling pieces prevent the projecting portions of the 
mold from being crushed in transportation. Cut long strips of paper 
and paste them here and there in all directions over the mold. Give 
the entire surface a coat of paste, and apply the sheets, slightly wet, 
with the edges in contact. One or two coats may thus be laid, the outer 
coat breaking joints with the next inner one. Beat all in lightly with 
the large brush. 

In a hot, dry climate, with the sun beating on the inscription, the 
mold will dry readily, the only precaution necessary being to paste the 
edges of the mold all around, here and there, to the edge of the inscrip- 
tion. This will prevent the mold from warping or the wind from de- 
taching it. 

In damp climates and under most circumstances it will probably be 
found best to apply hot sand to the mold to dry it. Sand is rarely dif- 
ficult to obtain, but its application is laborious. A frame should be 
built to fit closely against the inscription. One face of this (the side 
from the mold) should be covered with a sheet of canvas, or with tongue 
and groove boards. In either case cross strips or braces should be 
nailed at close intervals from side to side to keep the frame stiff, or to 
keep the canvas from sagging under the weight and outward pressure 
of the sand. The frame should be braced or shoved against the in- 
scription, and hot sand poured in the top between the frame and the 
mold until the space is full. The sand, besides drying the mold, will 
also keep it pressed closely against the inscription. As a general rule 
stone absorbs the heat so rapidly that several applications of sand are 
necessary. When the mold is finally dry remove the frame. Mark the 
mold with colored chalk, or with a pencil, into the number of divisions 
into which it is to be cut for packing. Give these each a number, and 
mark the edges so that there will be no difficulty in putting them to- 
gether again. Eemove the mold by prying it off gently with the model- 
er's knife. Lay it on the ground and pour the boiling, hardening mix- 
ture over it, using the brush to distribute it evenly. When dry turn 
the mold over and treat the other side in the same way; then cat it 
with the shears into the divisions previously marked, and pack for 
shipment. 

(Copy of a letter from Dr. Hamy relative to paper molds.) 

February 28, 1884. 

Dear Sir: I hasten to transmit to you the precise information that 
you have had the kindness to ask regarding our process of taking paper 
molds. 

This process, invented previously by M. Lottin de Laval and slightly 
perfected since, consists in the application, on the object which one 
wishes to reproduce, of a certain thickness of paper (unsized). This 
paper is applied wet on the desired surface and pressed in the crevices 



PROCEEDINGS OF UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 497 

or cuts by the aid of a bard brush (dog-grass, for example) witb or with- 
out a bandle, with which the paper is then methodically beaten on to 
the surface to be reproduced. 

When one is workiug on monuments or inscriptions of which the lines 
are very fine and elaborate, it is well to commence by first applying a 
sheet of white unsized paper of good quality to avoid the presence of 
vegetable fibers in the mold obtained. 

American inscriptions rarely have such a degree of fineness, and our 
travelers (collectors) have taken them simply with brown paper, of 
wbich I send you a specimen with this letter. 

This paper, remarkably elastic and fibrous, is sold by the firm of 
Batalla & Blain, merchants, commissioners, and armorers, No. 7 " Eue 
Joliette," Marseilles, who will furnish you as many bales as may be ne- 
cessary. To mold Angkor Thorn in Cambodia, M. Aymonier took 30 
bales of this paper. 

You commence by applying one coat of this paper wet, and when it is 
properly beaten in or onto the surface, apply a good coat of flour paste 
to the surface of the paper ; apply a second wet sheet and use the brush, 
taking care in putting it on to cross the fiber of the paper — that is to say, 
to place the fibers crosswise if it is up and down in the first sheet, and 
vice versa. A new coat of paste ; third thickness of paper pressed or 
beaten in as the first ; paste ; fourth paper crossed and beaten as sec- 
ond ; paste, and then fifth sheet. 

With the fifth .thickness or layer the mold has sufficient resistance 
The mold being dry in place, take it off and harden it. To do this we 
employ the following mixture : 

Boiled linseed oil, called fat oil 3 parts. 

Essence of turpentine 1 part. 

Yellow wax 1 part. 

Which is boiled, well mixed, and applied boiling to the paper mold. 
You will find in the package here sent a fragment of a mold from Pa- 
lenque thus hardened, and in which the proofs in plaster have already 
been cast. 

Believe me, dear sir, &c,

SOLENISCUS ? (MaCBOCHEILLS) POXDER08U8 Swallow ' 

FlGfe. 1, 2. — Opposite views of a large example from Southern Iowa. The outer lip and a portion of 
the columella have been broken away so that the obtuse fold is not clearly shown. Professor 
Swallow's species was never figured; and this form is doubtfully identified by means of 
his description. (Museum No. 9142.)

Soleniscus (Macrocheilus) fusiformis Hall, t 

Figs. 4,5,6. — Different views of two examples from Illinois, showing 8ome variation in the outward 
form of the shell, and also the character of the columella. Fig. 5 shows the character of the 
inner lip at mature growth j and Fig. 6 shows the columella with its fold and broad groove 
after a portion of the last volution has been removed. 

Soleniscus (Macrocheilus) newberryi Hall. 

Figs. 7, 8. — Opposite views of an example from Illinois, showing the outward form, the accumulation 
of callus upon the inner lip, and the columellar fold and broad groove. 

Soleniscus planus "White. 

Figs. 9, 10. — Opposite views of an example from Illinois, showing the outward form, and the columella 
with its fold and groove. This form is possibly identical with the Macrocheilus Newberryi of 
Hall; but it seems to be different. 

Soleniscus (Macrocheilus) ventricosus Hall. 

Figs. 11, 12. — Lateral views of two Illinois examples. Fig. 11 represents an apertural view of a 
nearly perfect shell ; and Fig. 12, another shell from which a large part of the last volution 
has been removed, to show the columella with fold and groove. (Museum Nos. 9372 and

Coal Measures of Illinois has been doubtfully identified by means of his description. 

Soleniscus 1 (Macrocheilus) medialis Meek & "Worthen. 

Figs. 15, 16. — Opposite views of an example from Indiana, showing the outward form and the colu- 
mella, which bears only a slight trace of a fold. 

Soleniscus (Macrocheilus) paludinjeformis Hall. 

Fig. 17. — Lateral view of an example from Indiana, with a part of the last volution removed, showing 
the columellar fold and broad groove. 

Soleniscus typicus Meek & "Worthen. 

Fic.s. 18, 19. — Copies of Meek & Worthen's figures of their type-specimen. • 
All figures on this plate are natural size. 

* This plate is also to appear in the annual report of the Indiana State Geological Survey ; and the 
use of a part of the examples here figured has been courteously loaned for the purpose by Prof. John 
Collett, State Geologist. 

tThe name Macrocheilus fusiformis was preoccupied by Sowerby. Professor Hall's species belongs 
to the group which I refer to Soleniscus. If this view is accepted, and Sowerby's species also belongs 
to that group, the name of the American species must be changed.
