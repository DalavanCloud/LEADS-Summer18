PREFACE. 



Horticulture is one of those subjects which teem with endless variety. 
The raising of new Flowers, Fruits, and Vegetables — the importation of 
strange Exotics — the alterations in Practice, and the improvements in Culture, 
— furnish from time to time a continuous source of important and highly- 
interesting matter, well worthy of recording, and not less worthy of being 
studied. 

To collect, and concentrate in one Annual Volume, all matters of 
practical utility that have occurred during the year, has been the object of 
this Work ; and the success of the Volumes for 1846 and 1847 amply testifies 
that our labours have not been lightly appreciated — a compliment which we 
gratefully acknowledge. 

The subjects of every year are novel ; and, therefore, however much the 
several Volumes may assimilate in general character, the Contents of each are 
widely different, and replete with original and practical lessons ; — in fact, 
the " Annals of Horticulture " literally form a comprehensive History of 
Modern Gardening, and an Encyclopaedia of Horticultural Information for the 
time being. 

As heretofore, the Work will be continued in Monthly Parts, as the 
"Horticultural Magazine;" and at the close of the year will be bound up 
as the " Annals of Horticulture," in a Volume similar to the present.

THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



BY GEORGE GLENNY, F.H.S. 



This plant derives its chief attraction from 
the particular season in which it blooms. It 
is showy and varied, but it has neither ele- 
gance of habit, nor symmetry of form, nor 
fragrance to recommend it. The most remark- 
able of the flowers are notorious for their de- 
formity, and although we have now British 
seedling varieties coming something nearer to 
a proper standard, we are far from attaining 
what must be the character of the plant and 
flower before it can be ranked among the bet- 
ter class of Florists' flowers. 

Although a Chinese plant, our English 
varieties will soon outnumber and excel the 
original, and it will be, like the Camellia 
japonica, essentially English, or, at least, 
European, before many years pass over our 
heads. The plants are valuable as out-of- 
door ornaments in mild autumns, for they suc- 
ceed the dahlia ; and although a very severe 
frost will destroy foliage and flowers, they 
will live through a frost which will cut off the 
dahlia past recovery. They are, strictly speak- 
ing, half-hardy, but their beauty is frequently 
spoiled just as they are commencing their 
bloom. The plants, if grown in the ordinary 
way, are too tall to be handsome, and the 
lower leaves wither and turn brown before 
the blooms come to perfection, even when the 
season is suitable. This can only be coun- 
teracted by means of particular culture, and 
49. 



we can only accomplish an improvement in 
the habit by carefully counteracting the 
general tendency of the plant to grow lanky 
and talh In herbaceous borders, where the 
subjects are allowed to spread and throw up 
annually large bundles of stems, and where 
thegeneral collection of masses bloom yearafter 
year in large heads, the appearance of the 
Chrysanthemum is very showy ; and in such 
places they are undisturbed three or four years 
together ; but this can be hardly called culti- 
vation, — a hundred subjects that make very 
striking flowers under high culture, are but 
rough, though showy masses of bloom, when 
allowed to take their own choice. The carna- 
tion, pink, picotee, auricula, polyanthus, 
primrose, hyacinth, tulip, narcissus, and many 
other subjects which are noble under rich 
and judicious growth, spread and become 
large masses when left a few seasons, and, how- 
ever pretty in these wilderness-like borders, 
possess no claims to notice for their individual 
flowers, nor for the form of their plants ; yet, 
propagated yearly, or separated every season, 
or dug up and replanted properly and perio- 
dically, they preserve a character which is as 
superior as it is unlike the diminutive blos- 
soms that come in hundreds. The Chrys- 
anthemum, then, has to be looked upon in 
different stations ; first, as a perennial herba- 
ceous plant, in common borders, growing in 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



masses ; secondly, as a dwarf showy plant, 
sufficiently protected to preserve its foliage 
in choice clumps or flower borders ; thirdly, 
as a pot plant, to bloom under cover, and be 
removed wherever flowers are wanted. 

AS HERBACEOUS PLANTS. 

In all large concerns there are portions of 
the ground, especially distant from the dwell- 
ing, laid out as rough borders, in which her- 
baceous plants that require no culture are 
planted, to grow, spread, and bloom, year 
after year. Hollyhocks, Michaelmas daisies, 
Aaron's golden rod, perennial lupins, ever- 
lasting peas, early primroses, monk's-hood, 
digitalis, and a hundred other plants that die 
down and come up again, are planted and left 
without any other culture than forking the 
borders after they begin to grow, and giving 
an occasional dressing of some kind of manure. 
The Chrysanthemum ought to be among them, 
and form no small proportion of the whole. 
The yellow, primrose, white, red, brown, 
purple, and various other shades, may be 
planted in the spring. The ground ought not 
to be rich ; vigorous growth is very much 
against hardiness. The plant that will live 
through a frost in poor ground, will perish in 
the same temperature if the land be rich. 
This has been found by the growers of bro- 
coli. In hard winters acres have been cut. off 
in rich ground, while that in less exciting soil 
has escaped. If the border is anything like 
good ordinary loam, it is better merely to see 
that it is well drained, and plant without any 
dung or dressing. As the plants advance in 
height stakes should be placed to tie them up 
to, so that they may not be broken by high 
winds, and in due time, if frosr does not inter- 
vene, they will flower the first year, though 
not very strong. After the bloom is fairly 
off, and the beauty of the plant gone, they 
may be cut down to within four inches of the 
ground, and, if the weather be very severe, 
and litter can be had handy, a little thrown 
over the herbaceous border will protect many 
half-hardy subjects from damage. But there 
are many who do not think it worth the 
trouble, and therefore let all things take their 
chance. In the spring the plants shoot up 
much stronger, and require the same care as 
to tying to stakes ; but in these rough borders 
a single stake is generally all that is bestowed, 
thebranches being merely tied somewhatloosely 
together, something like a wheatsheaf, for 
the head of bloom covers all over the top, and 
looks best in a mass, besides being less damaged 
by hard weather. In this way, year after year, 
the plants will grow up and spread until they 
form huge bunches, with great masses of 
flowers ; and, when they become too large, 
*hey may be lessened by taking some of the 



roots away, all round, with the plants attached 
to them. This may be done by chopping off 
with the spade ; the pieces chopped off may 
be planted out elsewhere, or be used to make 
good any that are damaged or have died. 
The same management would apply also to all 
the other herbaceous plants of the kind, but 
our business is with the Chrysanthemum. 

AS DWARF PLANTS IN BORDERS. 

To make a naturally tall plant grow dwarf 
is not always an easy matter, but the facility 
with which the Chrysanthemum strikes en- 
ables us to take the tops off when they have 
made a considerable part of their growth, and 
thus produce the bloom -upon a stem half the 
length that it would have been. "We have 
always allowed the plants to grow as fast as 
they would, in a pit or greenhouse, or the open 
ground, but it is far better in the pit or 
greenhouse. In the months of June, July, 
and August, we have taken the tops of the 
strongest shoots, about three inches in length ; 
these should be cut up to a joint, and the lower 
leaves cut off, so as to leave half to three quar- 
ters of an inch of bare stem. Now prepare 
some wide-mouthed pots, by putting one-third 
of crocks, and fill up within three quarters of 
an inch of the edge of the pot, tapping the 
bottom on the potting-table to settle the soil 
moderately close, and make it quite level. 
The soil ought to be half loam, one-fourth 
turfy peat rubbed through a coarse sieve, and a 
fourth rotten cow-dung, also rubbed through 
the sieve. Fill up the pot with silver sand, 
which will be, of course, three quarters of an 
inch thick on the other soil, and with a very 
gentle watering saturate the sand and the soil. 
Then take a bell-glass, that will just fit a little 
within the edge of the pot, and, having first 
made a mark by pressing the edge into the 
sand, stick in the cuttings, ^o that the bottoms 
touch the soil through the sand, and not more 
than an inch apart. A gentle watering will 
settle the sand down close to the stems, and 
the glass should be then covered over, pressed 
into the sand a little to exclude the air, and 
the pot should be placed in a slight hot-bed, in 
a propagating-house, or in a cool part of the 
stove, and be shaded from the rays of the 
sun by a paper over the bell-glass. Whether 
there be one or twenty pots is immaterial — 
the same process must be gone through with 
each and all. Every morning the glasses 
should be wiped dry and bright ; cleanliness 
is everything with cuttings. The sand must 
be moistened whenever it gets nearly dry, and 
if any one of the cuttings exhibit anything 
like mildew or damping, remove it imme- 
diately from the pot, as there is nothing sooner 
caught than mildew or damp. In the course of 
a few days, comparatively, the cuttings will

begin to grow, and they are then in a fair way 
of striking. Continue your watchfulness, the 
drying of the glasses, the moistening of the 
sand, and removing any that appear inclined 
to damp off ; and when they have grown, and 
exhibit any appearance of having struck, pre- 
pare for potting them off. Use pots of the 
size of forty-eight to the cast, or large sixties. 
Put crocks at the bottom enough to ensure good 
drainage. Use nothing but loam from rotted 
turves if you can get it. You do not want to 
excite rapid growth ; on the contrary, the 
slower they grow the better, so that they keep 
growing in a healthy state ; put some of the 
loam, say half or two-thirds full, and then turn 
out the ball from the cutting-pot, or hold them 
sideways, and strike them gently sideways ; 
the sand will fall out, and the ball may be so 
loosened, that withdrawing the pot with a 
jerk will leave it on the bench. By pressing 
the ball it will part a little, so as to enable 
you to take the cuttings away one by one with 
earth about their fibres. Hold them upright 
in the pot, and place them so that the soil will 
come fully as high as the sand was. The 
earth should be pressed all round the root, 
moderately close, but not hard, and the pots 
knocked gently on their bottoms to settle the 
earth properly. After watering them, they 
should be placed in a frame, and the light 
covered down close the first day or two, and 
they must be properly shaded, or they will 
droop. Indeed they ought, if it were conve- 
nient, to be a little while in gentle heat, but 
this is rarely practicable, unless slight hot- 
beds were made on purpose. After the first 
day or two they must have plenty of air, and 
as soon as they have recovered the check they 
receive by transplanting, they may be removed 
to the open air on a hard bottom of pavement, 
or some contrivance which they cannot root 
into, for they will soon protrude their roots 
through the bottom of the pot, and strike them 
into a hard gravel walk if they are allowed to 
do so. They may have all the sun but an 
hour or two of the hottest in the middle of 
the day, but even this will not hurt them if 
they are kept well watered. The only danger 
is that, if they are neglected, the soil very 
soon bakes dry, and they then begin to suffer, 
and the leaves turn red or yellow. The best 
situation is a border which is protected from 
the midday sun, and made hard by paving, 
or having slates or wooden planks laid on ; in 
a very short time the pots will be filled with 
roots, and a change will be required, but the 
plants will be just ready to turn out in the 
clumps, borders, &c, whei*e they are to be 
flowered in their dwarf state. They may be 
planted out without dressing, three feet apart, 
to allow room for other subjects between them. 
They will flower at less than half the height 



they would have attained without cutting and 
striking, besides which they will not have lost 
their foliage nor their colour. The plants 
that are put out thus, would the next year be 
just as tall as any other ; and the only way to 
make them otherwise, is to take off the tops 
as we have described. 

IN POTS AS DWARF FLOWERING PLANTS. 

We have already described how the cuttings 
are to be taken and treated up to the filling of 
the first pots with roots. At the time when 
they are turned out as we have described for 
the beds and clumps, when dwarfing is an 
object, a certain portion may be continued in 
pots, but they will at that period require to be 
shifted into other pots a size larger. Nothing 
more need be done than striking the edge of 
the pot against the potting-table, while held 
the wrong way upwards ; the ball wall leave 
the pot whole. The crocks need not be dis- 
turbed, but a few being placed at the bottom 
of the new pot, and enough earth to just cover 
them, the ball may be placed in whole, as deep 
as may be, and the soil filled in all round, up 
as high as the edge of the new pot ; if the soil 
come higher up the plant than before, so much 
the better ; a gentle watering to settle the 
new earth round the ball will be necessary, 
and they may be then placed again in their 
out-of-door locality, attention being paid to 
their occasional moisture. They will all be 
more or less dwarf, according to the season, 
but in the general w r ay they require no other 
attention. We have already stated that the 
time to take these cuttings may be June, 
July, or August ; some, indeed, may be taken 
as late as September. It would be always 
found that the latest struck cuttings were the 
most dwarf when they bloomed, but it will be 
sometimes found difficult to strike the latest, 
and this is our chief reason for striking at 
different seasons. There will be no difficulty 
in procuring cuttings from the pots or out-of- 
door plants, but they answer better from 
potted plants, because they are always for- 
warder. They may again fill their pots with 
roots, and require a shift, but they ought to 
bloom in thirty-two sized pots, that is, pots of 
thirty-two to the cast, and technically called 
thirty-twos, and if they fill ever so much with 
roots, they must not be shifted into any larger, 
because you rather wish to check the growth 
than encourage it. In September the frost may 
come pretty sharply,and damage potted plants, so 
that about the middle of that month they should 
be placed in frames, and carefully closed and 
covered at night, on the least sign of severe 
weather ; but if this be not expected or likely, 
the glass is covering enough. The latest 
struck cuttings may be kept under glass all 
through, for as they may be potted off the

first time as late as the end of August, they 
cannot draw up much, but they ought to have 
all the air that can be given in mild weather, 
and only be closed in cold winds, and of even- 
ings towards the middle or end of September ; 
after this period they will show their bloom- 
buds, and when these once appear the plants 
do not grow materially. If fine flowers are 
the object, they must not be checked with 
cold, and many persons make up a house full 
of them, and regulate the temperature with 
great exactness. It will, however, always be 
found that the less artificial heat they have, 
the better will be the colour of the flowers 
and foliage, and the latter will be retained 
best on the stems ; which, in spite of the best 
management, will shrivel, turn yellow, or fall off 
altogether, when the plant is attempted to be 
forced, or, by the neglect of the watering, gets 
starved. It has been the custom of many 
nurserymen to take off cuttings as soon as 
they were strong enough ; but the great object 
of taking cuttings is lost under this treatment. 
The plants run up nearly as tall as if they 
were not taken off at all, but were left to grow 
their full height ; whereas, when their growth 
is half made, or even more than half, the tops 
have so much less to do, that they form really 
dwarf specimens when of the tallest kinds. 
Some, who appear to lose sight of the object 
in view, or, perhaps, never thought of it 
seriously, recommend cuttings to be taken in 
April, fancying, perhaps, they have made a 
great discovery, when they find that April 
cuttings strike more freely ; but they answer 
no purpose, because in April they are scarcely 
any length, while the June, July, and August 
cuttings are taken from the top of shoots two 
feet long. Now, we will not say that the top 
of a shoot two feet long, that would only grow 
to three feet if left on, would only grow the 
other foot, because fresh impulse gives vigorous 
growth ; but they will not grow one-half the 
length that April cuttings would, nor be half 
the trouble. The flowers as they advance and 
begin to open, become still more susceptible 
of damage by frost, and the prevention of this 
is the only care required at this late period of 
their cultivation. The nurserymen put them 
in houses, and give them a little heat, but the 
object is to bring them into flower earlier than 
they would come otherwise, and not with any 
hope of bringing them finer. Those in 
houses will commence flowering in October 
and November, and continue until some un- 
lucky frost gets to them, or they may be 
removed from time to time into the places 
their flowers may be wanted in. But the 
culture of Chrysanthemums may be considered 
complete, up to the period when the huds 
swell, and the flowers are opening ; the plants 
seldom grow much after that, unless they are 



in heat, and shaded, and this should always be 
avoided as much as possible, for the stems by 
elongating throw the leaves farther apart, 
and destroy the shrubby habit, which is, whe- 
ther natural or artificially produced, essential 
to the beauty of the plant. 

INCREASING THE BUSHY HABIT. 

Although we may obtain from cuttings 
much more free growth and larger flowers, 
and by taking them late keep the plants very 
dwarf without topping, they may also be 
dwarfed a good deal more by topping the 
strong shoots, and encouraging laterals. This 
is resorted to chiefly for large specimens, but 
the small potted plants that we have been 
treating of may be topped as soon as they are 
fairly established, and the side branches grow 
more numerous, and get forwarder than they 
would otherwise. The plant becomes more 
bushy, but the foliage and flowers come 
smaller. In short, we obtain more branches 
and bloom, but we sacrifice size to number, 
and sometimes it will be found necessary to 
top the laterals as well, for they would grow 
nearly as long as the original shoot would, 
and we have known plants so managed diffi- 
cult to bloom at all until very late in the 
winter. The way to manage these with the 
best chance of success, is to take one of the 
plants from the July cuttings, and as soon as 
it is planted out from the cutting-pot, and well 
established again, take off the top, leaving 
three inches, or if the plant be as short as that, 
merely pinch out the heart : as the laterals 
come out to the same length as theohdplantwas, 
they require to be stopped in the same manner, 
and in their turn will give out their laterals ; 
and where these cross one another, or are in 
the way of each other, or are too thick for 
their general appearance, they should be re- 
moved entirely ; but this may be continued 
so as to prevent flowering altogether, so that 
when the plant has become moderately bushy, 
all the shoots should be allowed to go up to 
bloom, and that without forcing, or heat of 
any kind, but merely protected from the 
weather by a frame and glass, and allowed all 
the air. 

DWARFING LARGE SPECIMENS WITHOUT 
STRIKING. 

We cannot prevent large plants from grow- 
ing to a considerable height, but we can at least 
check them a third of the elevation they 
would acquire in an ordinary way. The pots 
which have contained the plants of last year 
are at the close of the bloom placed in winter 
quarters, and the plants are cut down to 
within a little of the soil. In the spring, 
when these begin to grow, they should be 
turned out of these pots, trimmed, the top 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



surface of the soil taken away, pots a size 
larger should be procured, fresh drainage and 
fresh soil applied to the plants, the soil pressed 
well round the ball of earth, which if much 
bound should be loosened ; the whole should 
be well watered to close the earth about the 
roots, and the pots should then be replaced in 
the pit or frames they were in before ; these 
plants will in general throw up more shoots 
than are wanted, a selection of the strongest 
and best should be made after they have grown 
up a little, and all the lanky ones should be 
removed altogether. As they all advance 
they may be allowed to grow until the earliest 
cuttings are wanted, and the strongest shoots 
may be topped for that purpose. The length 
to which the shoots are shortened should be dif- 
ferent ; and in proportion to their strength the 
strongest should be left a good deal longer than 
the weakest, because they are capable of support- 
ing the greater number of lateral branches, 
but the tallest should not be more than six or 
eight inches high, and the weaker ones not 
more than half the height ; they may now be 
put out of doors, in the same way that young 
plants are, in the shade a little, and watering 
must be attended to. These plants will be 
considerably shorter, and more bushy in their 
habit, and bear a great many more flowers. 
But there is no way of producing the Chrys- 
anthemum so well, so elegant, in such good 
colour and condition as to foliage and flower, 
as that of taking the tops of the shoots at 
different seasons, and growing them without 
heat. 

CHRYSANTHEMUMS FOR SHOWING CUT 
BLOOMS. 

The system of culture for growing the best 
show blooms to cut, must be totally different 
from that which we have recommended for 
showing the whole plant. In the one case 
we want to exhibit a handsome bushy plant, 
with as many flowers as it will carry well and 
bring to an ordinary size ; in the other 
we care nothing about the plant, and only 
want an out-sized bloom to be cut off and 
shown in a stand. For this last purpose 
select a few of the best sorts, strike a portion 
in autumn, and another portion in early 
spring, in thumb-pots ; as soon as the roots 
reach the side change them to large sixties ; 
when the roots fill these change to forty-eights. 
All the while they are growing keep them out 
of doors in a sheltered situation and tied up to 
a stick but not too tight ; when their roots 
have filled the forty-eight sized pot, prepare 
the blooming-pots, size sixteen ; let there be 
a good two inches of crocks at the bottom and 
prepare a good rich compost, one-third good 
loam from rotted turfs, one-third turfy peat 
earth broken small, one- third well- rotted cow- 



dung, or dung from an old melon bed ; let 
this be well mixed and laid together a little 
while before using. When you shift, put 
upon the crocks that are for the drainage as 
much soil as will make the top of the ball of 
earth even with the top of the pot, and having 
taken the ball out whole with the plant un- 
damaged, fill up all round with the prepared 
soil, pressing it down between the ball and the 
pot. Take off all the side shoots all through the 
culture, from the time the cutting is first 
struck till the period of bloom. When the 
plants are shooting up pretty strong, take out 
the small stick to which they were tied, put 
regular carnation sticks and let them run up 
in the same way, be ready with the same kind 
of shade as the carnation. Besides having 
these in pots, plant some out of doors, but do 
not let the side shoots grow, and in other re- 
spects treat them as if they were in large 
blooming-pots. When the buds show them- 
selves, reduce them to the best two, and as 
soon as you can determine which is the most 
likely to answer your purpose, remove one of 
these, that all the strength may be thrown into 
one flower only : the plants in pots should be 
put into the greenhouse, or for want of that 
into a deep pit, or even into a dwelling-house, 
as soon as the weather becomes uncertain, 
because, as there is no succession of blooms, 
a frost would settle these altogether. Those 
in the ground may be bloomed upon tables 
like the dahlia, and covered with flower-pots 
in the night and during bad weather ; the 
bloom when once opening will not be improved 
by rain, nor by the sun when it is too power- 
ful, but covered over during the bad weather, 
and in the night, there may be a tolerably 
sharp frost without injuring the flower, and 
the plant stands a good deal of rough weather. 
Those who grow tulips under an awning will 
find the frame closely covered, protection 
enough for pots, and on taking the tulips up 
in June, the bed itself would carry the chrys- 
anthemums to a very good bloom, if they were 
planted out a foot apart, the dwarf ones out- 
side, the taller ones in the middle ; but only 
one shoot must be allowed to grow, and all the 
side shoots from that must be removed as fast 
as they grow. In the middle of September 
the side-cloths must be put up, and the top- 
cloth be put on, that they may be all made 
close in case of frost, and every night. They 
will have done their bloom in time for the 
tulips again, for as there is but one bloom, or 
two at the most, they will come earlier and 
be done with by the first or second week in 
November, which is time enough for the 
tulips. Those in the house will come the 
finest because they will have received no 
check. Those in the open ground will, how- 
ever, do well, and the lot flowered in the tulip

bed, will, if well arranged according to their 
heights, in five rows, a foot or a trifle less 
apart, form quite a handsome object during 
the greater part of October. If, however, 
they are not to be cut, but merely bloomed as 
a collection, three blooms may be left on each, 
to last so much the longer in flower. Chrys- 
anthemums are packed for showing the same 
as dahlias are, in tubes, with the stems through 
a stopper made of wood, cork, turnip, or 
potato, and so kept from bruising their under 
leaves by the height of the stopper, above the 
stand in which the tube is dropped, or some- 
times fixed. 

PROPERTIES OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM. 

"We expect a sort of remonstrance against 
the properties which we shall set down as 
desirable in the Chrysanthemum, because the 
forms of the present varieties are as numerous 
as were those of the dahlia when the published 
rules first st-t to rest the properties of that 
universal favourite. There were among them 
at that time anemone-flowei*ed, China-aster- 
flowered, globe-flowered, single, and semi- 
double, flat, starry, and ragged flowers, to say 
nothing of colours. In the Chrysanthemum, 
we are told in a very recent publication, that 
there are the ranunculus-flowered, the in- 
curved, the China-aster-flowered, the marigold - 
flow T ered, the clustered, and the tasselled, all 
of which, except the ranunculus-flowered, are 
untidy and flimsy. Great efforts have been 
made to bring these flowers into notice, and 
shows have been established at which the 
judges have not known by what rules to award 
the prizes, or which flower was the best. We 
affirm with great submission to those who 
pride themoelves on this flower, that it is im- 
possible to select one less fit to exhibit, cut 
from the plant, and that individually there is 
nothing to hope for in the bloom itself that 
should raise it to the dignity of a florist's 
flower; but as there is great merit in growing 
the plant well in pots only, and as the plant is 
showy when there is a scarcity of bloom in a 
house, they ought always to be shown in pots 
only, and the merits of the plant be taken 
into account quite as much as that of the 
bloom, and as such we shall notice both. 

1. The plant should be dwarf, shrubby, 
well covered with green foliage to the bottom, 
the leaves broad and bright, the flowers well 
displayed at tie end of each branch, come in 
abundant quantity, and be well supported by 
the stems. 

2. The flower should be round, double, high 
in the crown, perfect in the centre, without 
disk or confusion, and of the form of half 
a ball. 

3. Tiie individual petals should be thick, 
6mooth, broad, circular at the ends, according 



with the circle of the flower, the indentations 
where they meet hardly perceptible. 

4. The petals must not show their under- 
sides by quilling, and should be of such firm 
texture as will retain them all in their places. 

Size of bloom to be large in proportion to 
the foliage, but the size only to be considered 
when plants are in all other respects equal. 

The properties we have described bring a 
good flower under one of the two classes, 
ranunculus-flowered, or marigold-floAvered, 
and therefore we pronounce the tasselled, the 
quilled, the incurved, and all ragged and con- 
fused varieties, as well as all those which ex- 
hibit a disk, to be inferior to the other flowers 
in all the points in which their deficiencies 
can be recognised, and sincerely hope that 
there may in a few seasons be a sufficient 
number of good ones to enable us to banish 
them altogether as show flowers. 

A FEW OF THE BEST CHRYSANTHEMUMS. 

A society has at length been formed in the 
Metropolis for the encouragement of this 
autumnal visitor, and we have been gratified 
with a sight of Chrysanthemums as large as 
medium-sized dahlias. The capabilities of 
this flower are but little known by ordinary 
dealers ; for we have been to the advertised 
collections of Messrs. Chandler, said to be the 
best, and we are bound to say that we there 
saw nothing to tempt us to grow the Chrysan- 
themum, except as an out-of-door subject to 
prolong the lively appearance of the garden 
after the dahlias are over. The lanky branches, 
only half furnished with discoloured leaves, 
even in the best we saw, rendered them very 
ugly in pots, and those who do not see them 
grown as they may be grown, will not be 
tempted to adopt them as a stock flower in 
collections. Since the properties of the Chrys- 
anthemum were laid down a few years since, 
the foreigners appear to have chosen their new 
varieties better, and there are some approach- 
ing the standard. As a proof of the difference 
between well-grown and ill-grown specimens : 
we had made a descriptive list for the purpose 
of publication from the collection at the Vaux- 
hall Nursery, and after attending the show of 
the Chrysanthemum Society, held at the 
Rochester Castle, Stoke Newington, we threw 
our list into the fire ; we will give a specimen 
of the discrepancy. 

The Clustered Yellow. — "Bright 
yellow, flow r ering in clusters, with soft quilled 
i petals, standing out like irregular rays ; these 
! in some places thick ; in others thin, so that 
! the flower never forms a circle ; hard, con- 
, fused eye, with petals undeveloped ; abundant 
j bloom." 

Perhaps the above description, taken honestly 
[ from scores of plants at Vauxliall, is as unjust 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



as could be written ; but it seems that the Chrys- 
anthemum, like many other subjects, wants 
more care than nurserymen will bestow. 
Clustered yellow was in all the winning 
stands, and there were many pots of it besides, 
and our description from well-grown speci- 
mens would be thus : — 

Clustered Yellow. — A noble round 
bright yellow flower ; very full on the face 
with exceedingly good centre petals, inclined 
to cup, and altogether one of the best show- 
flowers, according to the properties laid 
down. 

Goliah, another grand flower, was ex- 
hibited, as large as a middling-sized dahlia. 
The petals of this flower curl upwards and 
turn over inwards, showing the back of the 
petal, but very uniformly closing into as 
splendid a bloom as ever we saw, forming 
almost a cone, but rounded. The colour is 
pale, but it is darkened gradually on one side, 
like an apple or other fruit ; the shading is so 
gradual though it deepens. The centre of 
this flower is good, though made up as it were 
by the curling petals meeting in the middle. 
We are quite within bounds in saying that 
Goliah was four inches across, and beautifully 
formed, the outline as true as a drawn circle. 

Two coloured incurved is a noble flower, 
the front of the petals one colour, the back 
another, and all the petals sufficiently incurved 
to show the backs. The face is rather hollow, 
but it is a bright-looking flower in a stand. 

One of the neatest and best formed of all is 
Annie Salter ; a small flower, bright yellow, 
with reflexed petals, laying well, and forming 
two-thirds of a ball. There is nothing among 
the whole tribe so completely a show-flower 
as this little pet, though it is very small com- 
pared with many favourites. 

Most of the Chrysanthemums in present 
cultivation, even the best, have curled, or, as 
they are called, incurved petals ; generally 
loose and irregular ; but there are a few and 
very few, that make up well, that is to say, 
that are symmetrical when full bloomed, and 
form a sort of half-globular flower, close 
enough to pass well in a stand. The publica- 
tion of the names of these will give our Con- 
tinental friends a good notion of what will pass 
current among florists; and we strongly advise 
all who intend to commence the cultivation 
of this flower, to confine themselves entirely 
to those we mention until they see something 
better, for the descriptions now publishing are 
altogether false, and we in vain, in a very 
large collection, sought for more ; we proceed, 
however, to describe them. 

Campestroni, purplish red, very full, toler- 
ably round ; a good full size, showing the 
dull underside of the petal by reason of its 
curling, the centre full of petals, but sunk. 



Beauty is after the fashion of Goliah, but 
not so compact. The flower forms well, be- 
cause, although the centre is thin, the petals 
curl over, and make up a nice globular and 
somewhat rich-looking flower. 

King is blush pink, curling like others, but 
making up into a showy, bold, round, good 
flower ; centre pretty round, and general 
appearance rich. 

Aristides is a fine orange-coloured medium- 
sized flower, very bold and full, desirable on 
account of its being the best of its colour, and 
showable. 

Defiance, large white, forms a good round 
flower by the petals curling inwards, so that 
the outside of them is shown ; the petals are 
not so thick as some, but the style is very 
pretty. 

Lucidum, a blush white; made up much in 
the same way by the petals curling inwards ; 
full-sized, and very pretty. 

Formosa is also a very pretty white, but 
not so large as some others ; forms a nice 
globular flower, although the petals are not so 
full as many of the sorts. 

These few are all that we should grow of 
the great number we have seen, and all we 
should recommend others to grow. There 
may be some new ones to come out in the 
season, and one especially that we at present 
do not know the name of, but which we mean 
to recommend to make up a dozen. It is of 
no use recommending a parcel of misshapen 
flowers that present no good qualities. It is 
wasting ground, and pots, and house-room to 
cultivate them. As, however, there are some 
who may wish to buy less than a dozen, the 
principal object will be to judge from the 
above descriptions which are the best, regard 
being had to diversified colours. The general 
management of the Chrysanthemum for the 
year round may be thus laid down : — 

January. — In this month most of the flowers 
will be gone, and the plants may be cut down to 
within three inches of the pot, and placed in the 
pits, where they can be covered up, or plunged 
in rows in the ground, to be hooped over, or 
covered with dry loose litter. Those which 
have not done flowering should have decaying 
blooms removed as fast as they decline. If 
the soil has wasted in the pots so that they 
are not full, fresh earth may be put to fill the 
pots, as the earth is some protection to the 
crowns of the roots, and it prevents water from 
lodging in the pots. 

February. — Continue as in January, 
taking out and providing for the bloomed 
plants, protecting against hard weather : the 
pits, or frames and lights should be left open, 
and the plants on all occasions uncovered in 
mild weather. 

March. — The balls may be turned out of 



THE CHRYSANTHEMUM, AND ITS CULTURE. 



the pots, the top surface rubbed off, some of the 
spent mould shaken out of the roots, which may- 
be slightly trimmed, the plants repotted in the 
same size or larger pots, with fresh compost, 
new drainage, and so forth, and may be 
replaced where they were taken from ; only 
remember that when plants are plunged, the 
hole in which the pot is placed ought to be 
carried down lower than the bottom of the 
pot, narrow enough to prevent the pot from 
going down, but sufficient to hold the water 
which runs through the pot, instead of pre- 
venting its egress, which would be the case 
were the pot fitted to the solid bottom. 

April. — The shoots come up thick now, and 
those who propagate for sale take them off as 
fast as they come, and continue striking them 
under a bell glass in sand and soil, and with 
a little bottom heat ; rub the glass dry e,\ery 
morning inside ; shade the cuttings from the 
sun by means of paper which does not exclude 
the light. Those plants which are to be 
grown for specimens are not to lose any of 
their tops, but may have all superfluous shoots 
removed to strike for young plants. Continue 
protection through the month, and when 
necessary give them moderate waterings. 

Mat. — The plants may now generally be ex- 
amined and removed to a sheltered and shady 
place, where they are to make their summer 
growth. You may continue to remove super- 
fluous shoots and branches for propagation, and 
strike them as before directed* At the end of the 
month some of the struck cuttings may require 
potting off, and they should be continued in 
the heat they were struck in until the plants 
have recovered their check. You may begin 
now to trim the large specimens, leaving no 
more main shoots than you require. 

June. — Top some of the longest of the shoots, 
but not generally, as July and August cuttings 
make shorter and better plants ; but, where 
quantity is required, we cannot be too much 
upon the alert ; strike them as before. Pot 
off struck cuttings, and those which have be- 
come established and got over the potting may 
now be placed out where they are to grow ; 
some may be left to grow naturally, others 
may have the tops taken off to throw out late- 
rals. The large ones must be looked to and 
treated as required ; if they are to be grown 
as specimens, they must be shortened and 
trimmed out ; if destined to supply late cut- 
tings for dwarf plants, they may go on grow- 
ing. See to the watering, which must never 
be neglected with growing pot plants, because 
they dry rapidly. 

July. — Take off more cuttings from the tops 
of the strong shoots of the plants left for the 
purpose, and strike them as before. Pot off all 
those that are struck, and shift some of the 
earliest that have filled the pots with roots. 



Give also all the specimen plants a shift, if 
they have filled their pots with roots. Look 
well to the watering; top any of the small 
plants intended to be made bushy ; and place 
out those plants which have been potted off 
and have recovered themselves. 

August is a continuation of the same events, 
and, therefore, requires a continuation of the 
same treatment as tbat for July, Take off the 
last cuttings. Let them be from the tallest 
shoots, for they will, in the end, make the short- 
est plants. Strike them with great care and 
attention, because they are naturally the most 
obstinate. Pot off struck cuttings ; shift 
plants which have filled their pots from one 
size to another ; and look well to the specimen 
plants, which require thinning out, topping, 
removing, or shortening, the growing shoots 
to give something like symmetry to the plant, 
So with the young ones. If they are not 
growing handsome, and are getting lanky, 
shorten them also, always excepting those to- 
be grown naturally, but from cuttings ; tie up 
the specimens out of doors. Plant out some 
in the open ground. 

September. — Some of the plants are indi- 
cating flower, and all have, by the end of this 
month, come pretty well to their growth. Now 
they must be taken to their several places, ac- 
cording to their purpose, some into a warm 
greenhouse to bloom, and be drawn up, and 
spoiled ; some to the conservatory, to figure 
among the few autumn flowers ; but the mass 
to cold pits, where they are protected from 
frost, but can have all the air in mild weather, 
even by the entire removal of the glass all 
day. In all their stations they will require 
occasional watering ; fasten any of the loose 
shoots of these in the open ground. 

October and November is a mere con- 
tinuance of their approach to, or their com- 
pletion of bloom ; and they merely want the 
same treatment. Some apply liquid manure 
to them instead of plain water. It is a wrong 
notion, spoiling the texture, the colour, and the 
endurance of the bloom. 

December., — The bloom of the early ones 
begins rapidly to decline ; and, as this occurs, 
cut down the plants, and remove them into cold 
pits, or plunge them in the open ground where 
they can be protected by hoops and mats, or 
litter. See that the place be well drained, and 
have the pots filled with compost, that no water 
may lodge. Keep off the heaviest rains, if 
possible. Those in the open ground may be 
flowering half through this month, if the wea- 
ther has been mild ; but when the frost finishes 
the bloom, they may be cut down and cleared, 
and left to take their chance, or be covered up 
with rough litter. All the plants are to be 
removed from their various flowering places 
to their resting quarters, and be tended during 



MANAGEMENT OF GA.UDEN ALLOTMENTS. 



the rest of the winter as plants at rest ; very 
little water, very little care, an occasional 
inspection to see that the draining is clear, is 
all they want. 



MANAGEMENT OF GARDEN ALLOTMENTS. 

Those who will allot ground to poor cotta- 
gers at a moderate rate are real benefactors ; 
and those who are ignorant of the means by 
which ground is made profitable should be 
instructed by a supply of some plainly written 
book, that they may read, or have read to them, 
or, to make the work of benevolence more 
complete, they should be instructed. Economy 
in the management of an estate turned into 
allotments is a first consideration, and were we 
to attempt anything of the kind we should do 
it effectually. Let us first consider, then, 
what is necessary to a garden ? First, good 
ingress and egress by well-made paths and 
roads ; second, a supply of water within reach. 
We will suppose fifty acres of land to be 
adopted, from its situation, for the use of the 
cottage population of a village or town, and 
that the ground is worth 3/. per acre as a 
rental. To this fifty acres of land there 
should be a road or roads, so that there might 
be no difficulty of approach in bad weather. 
The number of allotments should be two 
hundred, which would allow of forty rods to 
each person, and the holding should be limited 
to the forty rods until a man could show the 
managers or the owner that his family was 
large enough to render him a proper object for 
more. The forms of these allotments should 
be, as near as may be, ten rods long and four 
wide, and as many of them squared properly 
as the form of the entire space will allow. Of 
course, some will be w r orse than others. We 
would have a range of pig-styes in the most 
convenient part, for the purpose of being let at a 
trifling rent to such allotment holders as choose 
to keep pigs, that they might have on the spot 
the means of using their waste profitably, and 
supply themselves with manure. There could 
be no difficulty in this arrangement, and many 
ways there are of carrying it out. On these 
fifty acres there should be placed a creditable 
man, whose cottage should overlook the whole 
plot, and who should have the following duties 
to perform : — He should keep the public roads 
in order, that is to say, the main roads that 
lead to all the allotments, but not the private 
paths ; he should be an inspector, to see that 
each allotment holder does not damage or 
infringe on his neighbour, or commit any nui- 
sance, or suffer weeds to seed in his ground 
and blow over other people's ; he should collect 
the rents weekly, and keep a record of all the 
occurrences of note ; he should keep a supply 



of appropriate seeds, purchased wholesale by 
the managers, and retailed at cost price to the 
holders ; and he should be in authority, as 
constable, to apprehend any trespasser or 
person committing wilful damage ; he should 
also keep spades, rakes, hoes, and other useful 
garden tools, bought wholesale and sold at the 
cost price to the allotment holders, or for a 
weekly payment instead of money down. We 
reckon this office at a cost of 20s. per week, 
or less, including his rent. So that let us 
charge the roads and repairs, and the pro- 
viding of proper wells or supplies of water 
at 1/. per acre, the overseer at 11. per 
acre, and the land 31. per acre. Let the 
charge for each allotment be 6d. per week, 
or twenty-six shillings per annum for each 
quarter of an acre, being at the rate of 
five pounds four per acre. The effect of 
allotments like these would be like magic on 
a rural population ; for it cannot be denied 
that in too many cases the prices have amounted 
to extortion. Five pounds per acre is enough, 
in all conscience, for a poor man to pay : but 
in scores of places there is more than double 
the rent charged ; in some places it has 
amounted to twelve pounds per acre. Here 
we have the means of providing two hundred 
poor men with each a garden large enough for 
his family purposes for sixpence a week; and it 
should be the study of the managers to draw 
up such rules as might prevent the holders 
from extravagance or waste by restricting 
them to the articles they should grow. These 
rules might extend to an obligation to grow so 
many rods of potatoes every year, and no more, 
because the first object should be the ensurance 
of food for the family, and preventing them 
from growing too much of a lazy crop. A 
few stringent regulations as to the disposal of 
so much of the land in useful food, and ju- 
dicious restriction of the quantity that might 
be used for flowers and useless or extravagant 
crops, would be as necessary to the well- 
being of the holder as the land itself. Sup- 
pose there were none, a man naturally idle 
might plant all his plot with potatoes, leave 
them to take their chance till earthing up 
time, and then leave them till the time for 
taking up, when, having more than he can 
possibly use, he would have to sell them, and 
the money might possibly be expended badly; 
whereas, if he were obliged to have different 
crops in about the proportion that families 
consume vegetables, he would be obliged to 
work at his garden continuously, and provide 
wholesome changes in the vegetable diet of his 
family, and sell the surplus if he please. We 
have especially mentioned potatoes, because we 
should not like to see our rural population 
become lazy. Ireland gives us too fatal a 
result for us to adopt potato culture as the 



10 



MANAGEMENT OF GARDEN ALLOTMENTS. 



dependence of our working classes. It has 
been, in our opinion, the ruin of the people 
there, as far as the total prevention of honest 
industry can be so called. If a family there 
could secure a piece of ground planted with 
potatoes, and take up the crop, it was all they 
cared for, the labour was nothing ; the crop 
was their food, and so without any incitement 
or encouragement to work, and enough potatoes 
to keep them from starving, they were alike 
reckless of every thing beyond the mere pos- 
session of their store to last the season. The 
failure of their crop, therefore, was the failure 
of every thing. To find them labour and pay 
them well for it was forcing them into active 
exertion, which they could not brook, and 
making them work or starve ; this un- 
fortunately put the whole population out of 
the way ; their discontent was manifest, — 
their idleness a downright firmly- rooted vice. 
They would understand nothing in the way of 
relief except finding them food, while they 
indulged, as heretofore, when their pits were 
full of potatoes ; and unless there were certain 
restrictions in the mode of cropping, the allot- 
ment of land among the rural population of 
England might in some degree awaken notions 
by no means beneficial to their morals or their 
social condition. There is as much to guard 
against in one extreme as the other. Give 
the poor gardens that shall enable them to use 
their over hours, and by means of increased 
industry procure a greater plenty of good 
wholesome vegetable food, and you teach them 
the value of labour by the double operation of 
profitably filling up their leisure time, and 
keeping them out of some other, and in all 
probability costly occupation. Nothing in our 
experience tends so to demoralize men as idle 
time on their hands : the mind must be 
amused ; the less mind a man has the more 
easily is he induced to go astray. What is the 
ordinary consequence of a man coming from his 
daily labour with three hours daylight on his 
hands before bed-time ? He and his com- 
panions, with no profitable object in view, — 
nothing to tempt them to advantageous occu- 
pation, go and take — we are putting the most 
favourable construction on the thing — go and 
take their social pipe and pint of beer at the 
ale-house ; suppose this to be done, and no 
more, the man has expended at the week's end 
one shilling for beverage in which his wife 
and children participated not, and goes home 
to bed to get up to his daily labour in the 
morning and repeat the same in the evening; so 
that instead of adding one iota to his resources 
by the three hours of his own time, he uses 
them to lessen his income, if nothing worse. 
But suppose — and this applies to a large por- 
tion of the rural population — suppose the 
mind is a little more active, and wants a little 



more excitement, — suppose there are games at 
skittles and bowls, and quoits, and other more 
objectionable gambling going forward, and he 
mixes with the throng, it is not one nor two 
pints that will do, and the Saturday night is a 
painful one to the mother and children at 
home ; suppose half the wages have gone to 
pay the ale-house score, and suppose the frugal 
shilling laid by for clothing by the frugal 
housewife is missing, and we gradually see the 
poor creatures worse clad and worse fed : 
what, then, becomes of the man ? He does 
not improve while he has three hours of idle 
time on his hands. He gets from bad to w T orse; 
he begins to see griping poverty at home. 
He has seen enough to feel acutely now and 
then the mischief he has done ; but, with no 
path pointed out for him, and no apparent 
means to recover himself, he flies to the ale- 
house to dissipate the gloomy picture, and 
makes bad worse; perhaps joins some society of 
poachers, and tries to get by these means some- 
thing to make up for the money spent in drink. 
One step only from poaching to less equivocal 
robbing, and the man is lost. How to reclaim 
the thousands of this precise character is 
worth serious consideration. Offer him an 
allotment, as in some places they do now, — he 
has no tools, no money for seed, no means of 
starting fair. Hence the necessity of adopting 
a system. Let the same power that provides 
him with a quarter of an acre of land at six- 
pence per week, provide him with his proper 
tools, seeds, and other necessaries, at sixpence 
a-week more till they are paid for, and the man 
is saved. He will fly to his garden, and feel 
it the greatest relief ; he will feel the good 
effects in an incredibly short time; he will lay 
down on his pillow fatigued, — but to lay down 
with a quiet mind after fatigue is one of those 
luxuries which are valued by all who can 
enjoy it; and who can so well enjoy it as those 
who have been previously in the habit of 
going home to a wretched wife, to ragged 
children, to an empty cupboard, feverish with 
drink, but nevertheless sensible enough to be 
cut to the heart by the sighs of his neglected 
helpmate ? Yet thousands of such men are 
allowed to go step by step to infamy and per- 
dition for want of considerate superiors. All 
men have to pay some sacrifice for the pre- 
servation of the bulk of their property. They 
pay for a watchful police ; they pay an in- 
surance premium to save themselves in case 
of fire ; and if the landed gentry in every 
town would devote the most favourably situated 
fields to give the humble population the benefit 
of a garden, they would be preserving in the 
most effectual manner the rest of their pro- 
perty. They would not be called upon for 
so much poor-rates; they would protect them- 
selves better than the police can protect them 



MANAGEMENT OF GARDEN ALLOTMENTS.

from continual petty depredations : but there 
is one consideration that is far beyond all others; 
they would be saving their fellow-man from 
being totally lost in this world and the next. 
All we want to impress upon the minds of 
those who wish to adopt the system effectually 
is, that they should have an overseer who 
should be a practical gardener, living in a cot- 
tage on the spot : that, among other duties 
such as we have spoken of, he should be 
obliged to teach the holders the handiest and 
best way of doing things, when they were 
manifestly ignorant of it; that he should be 
provided with all the necessaries for the 
holders of allotments, to be sold to those who 
want them, at the cost price, and take the money 
weekly with their rent. This would be effective 
benevolence, and the fruits would be mani- 
fest in a rapidly improving neighbourhood. 
With regard to the nature of the restrictions 
as to crops, something must depend on locality 
and the habits of the people ; generally speak- 
ing, half the ground in potatoes should be the 
maximum, a quarter the minimum ; they 
should never be allowed to plant potatoes two 
years together on the same spot. Half the 
ground should be the maximum for wheat ; 
but there should be no obligation to sow grain. 
The other crops should be carrots, cabbage, 
lettuce, celery, spinach, onions, and other 
vegetables ; but there should be a restriction 
as to the quantity of any one thing, because 
the object is to make them provide well for 
families, and not be extravagant. Fruit 
should be restricted to the useful ; not costly 
fruit for sale. The object is not to create 
market-gardeners, but to make happy men 
and happy homes. We are quite certain that 
if anybody, no matter who, wishes to make 
the allotment system effective, all these pre- 
cautions are necessary. The first step is to 
lay out the ground, and see it drained pro- 
perly, and the necessary roads made, so that 
a cart can get to every garden. This may 
require a little consideration and skill, but the 
first expense is always the best ; employ some- 
body who knows his business, in the onset, 
and all will go well. If the thing be a paro- 
chial affair, all the labour can be had from the 
workhouse and distressed out-of-door paupers; 
the cost therefore will not be much. This 
once done, and the plots marked out, there 
can be no difficulty ; and we suggest that, to 
prevent any squabbling between the holders 
about boundaries, a common path should part 
all the pieces, stakes being driven down the 
centre and level with the surface, each being 
bound to keep eighteen inches clear path from 
such centre, but the path to be in common for 
both to use all of it — three feet being wide 
enough for any purpose. There are many 
regulations that may be required for particular 



localities, but of these we can say nothing ; 
and the laying out of the ground must depend 
altogether upon its situation, drainage, pro- 
bable supply of water, and other circumstances. 
But every parish should, for its own sake, 
have a piece of land to allot, and it should 
be very different to the best we have yet seen. 
In no one have we seen proper roads, proper 
drainings, proper supply of water, or that 
which to our view is indispensable, an in- 
spector or superintendent. In no one place 
do we know of a proper, economical, and 
attainable supply, upon easy terms, of the 
seeds, tools, and necessaries for cultivation ; 
and to these points do we earnestly call attention. 
Our notion of the amount to be charged for 
rent may be questionable in some localities, 
but our notions of the proper management of 
such establishments cannot be. And now we 
come to the last, though not least important, 
part of our arrangements — the periodical show 
of productions. There ought to be premiums 
awarded. Award first for a certain number 
of the best managed allotments ; for the best 
potatoes, carrots, cabbages, onions, savoys, 
lettuces, peas, beans, beetroot, and useful vege- 
tables only ; none for asparagus or sea-kale, or 
forced things of any kind. The judges should 
be authorized to award premiums for any new 
variety of anything raised on the ground, and 
for any ingenious contrivance in implement 
or practice that should be considered deserv- 
ing especial notice ; and the produce of the 
clay should be sold on the day of show, to the 
highest bidder, for the benefit of the owner. 
We can imagine that some will be deterred 
from adopting any such system by the ap- 
parent trouble and difficulty ; that others will 
think, as too many do now with existing allot- 
ments, that as long as the parties have their 
ground marked out, they may as well make 
the paths themselves ; and that as to draining 
and so on, it is expensive. But what is the 
use of setting men to work unprofitably ? 
Why set them to overcome evils, when they 
ought to be enticed by all the advantages that 
can be offered ? Let any considerate person 
weigh well what we have recommended, and 
then go to any existing set of allotments, and 
think which is the more likely to prosper. 
We have read a good deal, and seen a good 
deal, of allotments, and the present system of 
granting them, and their general management, 
but they are all full of objections. A vast 
deal of good lost for want of system ; a large 
portion of labour wasted because wrongly 
applied ; and all this for want of a good begin- 
ning. Every plot should be well defined by 
made paths, the centre of which should be the 
boundary, because there is no excuse for dis- 
turbing it ; the whole well drained, that the 
ground may be made really productive ; the

■whole approachable by good roads, to save 
labour in carrying on the proper dressings 
and bringing off the matured crops; and the 
whole watched, kept in order, supplied, and 
the rents collected, by a man always on the 
spot. This is the way to make allotments 
useful to the holders, beneficial to the neigh- 
bourhood, and, above all, important to all 
interested in the moral and religious improve- 
ment of the working classes. 



THE DAHLIA, AND ITS PROGRESS. 

Among all the flowers that have been 
noticed by florists as show subjects, none have 
attracted more attention than the dahlia ; yet 
the really improved varieties do not amount 
to one-tenth of the number sent out under 
warranty as show flowers. The present year 
actually affords little or nothing in the way of 
advance, and yet we have several praised by 
the newspapers as grand acquisitions. Any- 
body who reads Mr. Glenny's description this 
year, in the Almanack for 1848, will scarcely 
fail to observe that he has confined himself to 
descriptive particulars, and has altogether ab- 
stained from recommendation. Let any one 
who grows the dahlia for exhibition read 
these descriptions quietly, and judge calmly, 
and see whether there is anything to tempt 
him to buy. We have a flower of Mr. 
Whale's, held up certainly as the crack flower 
of the season, and it is just possible to be so. 
The only time it was shown, to our know- 
ledge, it was falling to pieces, but there was 
the remains of a noble and beautiful flower. 
It was a pure white, a beautiful outline, hand- 
some rounding face, compact well-formed 
petals, laid as symmetrically as possible ; but 
the inference drawn by growers when a thing 
is seen but once, and then seen badly, is that 
it is uncertain. This may or may not be, for 
some men care little about prizes at country 
shows, and will not take the trouble to show 
at them. Mr. Whale generally confines his 
exhibitions to the metropolitan and the Salis- 
bury shows ; so that his Delight, though only 
seen once, and in bad condition, may never- 
theless be as certain as most flowers ; and if 
so, it is a splendid variety, an improvement 
on all the edged flowers. However, going to 
the merits of the present year's dahlias, we 
are directed to Gem and Shylock, as two 
grand acquisitions, whereas we maintain that 
(even allowing all Mr. Glenny says of them 
to be true) neither of them beat flowers in 
the same way already in our collections. Mr. 
Glenny says of Shylock, that it is " rather 
coarse," that the petals are "large," and that the 
" outline is not perfect ;" all of which is per- 
fectly true. The outline is a sort of rosette, 



instead of a circle ; and we aver that Scarlet 
Gem is worth a thousand of it. Shylock is a 
good flower of the old school, and it is, more- 
over, a certain flower ; it is in scarlets (sup- 
posing it were a good scarlet) what Essex 
Triumph is in darks; Berryer beats the one, 
and Gem the other, as completely as Spring- 
field Rival beat all its predecessors. But a 
certain flower is sure to be in more stands 
than an ordinary one, though it were twenty 
degrees worse. Though we insist upon it 
that Gem and Berryer beat completely in 
these two classes, let us be understood not to 
object to Shylock as a new flower; but the 
extravagant praises bestowed on it proceed 
either from interested, or from ignorant, or 
from inconsiderate people. Gem is a style of 
flower that we have had various grades of ; 
the Maid of Bath was the coarsest, the 
Bridesmaid was better, and the Marchioness 
of Ormond better than Bridesmaid and all in 
the same way ; but they were so dreadfully 
treacherous and uncertain that many discarded 
Bridesmaid, and nearly all threw the last 
away ; nevertheless, both were better flowers 
when perfect. We do not, however, object 
to Gem coming out as a new flower ; it may 
be useful, but it is not a jot better than Lady 
of the Lake, Miss Vyse, and some other 
light flowers ; it deserves to come out, but it 
does not deserve the praises lavished on it by 
the newspapers. It is, as Mr. Glenny says in 
the almanack, "rather coarse;" which, when 
we look to such flowers as the Standard of 
Perfection, Sir Robert Sale, the Queen of 
Roses, and others that come in the style of 
a ranunculus, and almost form a new race, is 
a fault not to be lightly treated. We do not 
object to the dealers themselves describing a 
new thing in flying colours, — it is natural they 
should make the best of it ; but we protest 
against the praises of needy adventurers who 
are employed on journals, being received as 
any authority, when the facts before us show 
that they assert of flowers what is not true. 
In the list described by Mr. Glenny, who is 
usually looked up to, he precedes the descrip- 
tion by saying, " We have no first-rate varieties 
to report." We read the descriptions carefully, 
and believe they are just, so much so, that 
people who read may suitably make up their 
minds what they would buy. If we could only 
buy one from his description, it would be De- 
light. If we could stretch to half-a-dozen, we 
should add Shylock, Queen of England, Gem, 
Walter Hilson, and Lady Ashley. And if 
it were to be pushed to a few more, we should 
add, Fire King, Jane, Forest Flower, War 
Eagle, Boule-de-feu, and Attraction; we mean 
that this would be our conclusion from Mr. 
Glenny's descriptions. Nell Gwynne, Canary, 
and Mont Blanc, we take to be among the

last on the list, chiefly on account of their 
colour, and having no particular redeeming 
point. With Mont Blanc, Canary, and Nell 
Gwynne may be placed Yellow Perfection, 
Sir Robert Peel, and Richard Cobden. It 
was, however, quite right to describe all these, 
because they have all been conspicuously 
shown, and many of them cried up too much 
for the price to be honest, and the public are 
glad of a fair and fearless opinion. But we 
should feel more inclined to take the growers' 
recommendation of things that have not been 
seen, than to come down too low in Mr. 
Glenny's scale. If he has not seen one-half 
that are to come out, there may be some good 
ones in the back-ground ; still there are 
enough among those described to do for mo- 
derate growers, and as such the almanack will, 
after all, be chiefly looked to for the direc- 
tions what to buy. Fancy flowers have, 
however, taken a fair start. Mrs. Shaw 
Lefevre is one of Mr. Glenny's pets, he 
expresses no doubt ; it is " dull red and 
white, but splendid form, and a great favou- 
rite." This is distinct then, and no mistake : 
Jenny Lind a second, Jeannie Deans a third, 
Belted Knight a fourth, Eliza Meilez a fifth, 
because it is lugged in by Mr. Glenny in a 
postscript; but we should depend on the sheet 
almanack more than the book, sjmply because 
it is published two months later. We have, 
however, seen several circulars, but the prin- 
cipal object of this paper is to show, that 
unless some one who can be depended on will 
give us fair descriptions, it is impossible to be 
at all prepared for the overwhelming lists of 
new subjects from which men of limited 
means have to select not more than half a 
dozen or a dozen ; but we positively assert, 
that among those Dahlias which the public 
have an opportunity of knowing, or of which 
they have been able to read anything to be 
depended upon, there is not one advance 
among the show sorts, unless it prove to be 
Delight ; the others are, according to the 
best authority, not first-rate. But the follow- 
ing may be had for their several qualifications. 
We may say, however, that the fancy kinds 
are advancing, for they are becoming of a good 
form. 

Delight, for its form and beauty. 

Shylock, for its constancy and high centre. 

Queen of England, for its rich colour and 
novelty. 

Gem, for its deep tip when in good order. 

Walter Hilson, for its brilliant orange. 

Lady Ashley, for its compactness. 

Fire King, for its dazzling orange-scarlet. 

War Eagle, for its deep red and con- 
stancy. 

Boule-de-feu, for its general usefulness. 

Attraction, for its rich colour and shade. 



Forest Flower, for its thick petals and 
dense lilac. 

Jane, for its usefulness as a light flower. 

And these may be taken almost in the order 
we have placed them. According to the number 
wanted, people may begin at the top, and 
come downwards. Then, as to fancy flowers, 
they appear to stand upon their merits equal 
up to five, and we would add a sixth : — 

Mrs. Shaw Lefevre, for exquisite form 
and distinctness. 

Jenny Lind, for richness of colour and gene- 
ral form. 

Jeannie Deans, for general form and new 
colour. 

Belted Knight, for novelty of colour and 
good form. 

Eliza Meilez, for its splendid form and 
rich colour. 

Lady Sale, we would add ourselves. 

We believe much good will result from the 
new Seedling Society encouraging the raisers 
of new varieties of every thing, for it will lead 
to the assembling of all classes of gardeners, 
and the consequent temptation of many to try 
upon fresh subjects. A market-gardener, for 
instance, who joins it for the sake of the new 
fruits and vegetables introduced, may be easily 
tempted to grow a few rods of seedling dah- 
lias, and a greater chance of producing novel- 
ties than many who have, year after year, 
been sowing seeds carelessly, and planting 
thousands with far less chance of striking 
novelty, than the new man who sows seed 
from a dozen first-rate kinds, and plants out 
only hundreds. At all events, there is nothing 
this year that can be called an advance. Mr. 
Glenny speaks of a new flower of the present 
season, of which only one bloom has been 
shown, " The Maid of Kent," and if there was 
the least dependence on its constancy, it might 
be a star, but we are in doubt about it. The 
make of the flower is similar to Princess Radzi- 
ville, and if it be one-half so certain, it will be 
a valuable addition. There is one variety this 
year, also, of which we can say but little, be- 
cause we have seen but little; we allude to 
Yellow Perfection ; we have only heard of 
two blooms being seen, one good, the other 
middling, and the flower is two years old, so 
that there ought to have been more ; a single 
plant ought, if at all certain, to have yielded 
four blooms for the Surrey Gardens, instead of 
one, because they are not all obliged to be 
perfect, and a good judge of a flower cannot 
be prejudiced by three of the four being out 
of condition. The one bloom, however, fully 
justified the name, it was a neat, compact, 
well-formed flower, and if it be at all con- 
stant, may become a great favourite. Any 
who buy it purchases a ticket in a lottery, 
that may come up a prize or a blank; if a 



14 



THE IXIA AND ALLIED PLANTS. 



prize, it will be a good one, because there 
cannot be many made from the very small 
stock in existence. Upon the whole, then, 



we come to the conclusion, that there has been 
very little done to improve collections beyond 
adding to the variety of " useful flowers." 




CULTURE OF THE IXIA AND ALLIED PLANTS. 



Ixias are among the most handsome of the 
smaller greenhouse bulbs ; but, notwithstand- 
ing this, they are but rarely met with in cul- 
tivation. This cannot arise from any real 
difficulty in growing them, for they readily 
submit to cultivation, and only require pecu- 
liar attention as to their growing and resting 
seasons : doubtless it is referable to that po- 
pular prejudice by which familiar forms excite 
a less degree of attention than those of a more 
novel character, for some years since these 
plants were more frequently to be met with ; 
or it may be that gardeners, at that time, were 
not so generally impressed with the import- 
ance of affording to all plants — and bulbous 
ones especially— a season of repose, and, in 
consequence, were not so successful with these 
plants as they might have been. 

Ixias belong to the natural family of Irises 
(Iridacese), and to the Linnasan Triandria 
Monogynia. The name is said to be derived 
from Ixia, bird-lime, in allusion to the viscid 
nature of some of the species. They are all 
natives of the Cape of Good Hope, whence 
bulbs are annually imported : it is said that, 
in company with other plants of a similar 
nature, which form the greater part of the 
vegetation in some situations, these plants 
spring up during the rainy season, clothing 



the hitherto barren plains as if by magic, first 
with a carpet of green, which is soon ex- 
changed for one of gay and varied colours. 
After the flowering season is past, the plants 
perfect and ripen their foliage, being assisted 
to do so by the moisture contained in the soil 
acting in conjunction with the bright light and 
heat of those latitudes : the heat of the sun 
being continued, while the supply of moisture 
is cut off until the next rainy season, the 
ground becomes gradually dried, and the 
plants are ripened off at the same time, the 
face of the country then becoming, as it were, 
again a barren waste. This natural mode of 
growth at once points out what should be the 
leading features of any course of artificial 
treatment to be successful in cultivating 
them. 

For the most part they are most conve- 
niently regarded as greenhouse bulbs, not, 
however, actually requiring to be kept in a 
greenhouse, for a pit or frame in which they 
can be sufficiently protected will grow them 
to perfection. In cases, however, where there 
is a greenhouse, it usually happens that there 
are situations, such as shelves and narrow 
ledges, where small plants of this nature can 
be placed with greater convenience than if a 
pit or frame were entirely devoted to them. 



THE IXIA AND ALLIED PLANTS. 



15 



We mention this then prominently here, be- 
cause we shall have occasion to recommend 
the use of pits as very appropriate and econo- 
mical situations for them during the period of 
their growth. Ixias may, however, be grown 
in a warm sheltered border in the open 
ground. 

CULTURE IN THE GREENHOUSE. 

We will commence with the bulbs in a state 
of rest. When in this state they are to be 
kept quite dry, being allowed to remain in the 
soil exactly as they were growing. A dry 
shelf, at the back part of the greenhouse, is a 
very suitable position for them, when in this 
state ; and they require no other care than 
to be kept dry until the time of potting 
them. 

The time for potting may depend on cir- 
cumstances. Where there are more than a 
very few roots, it would he desirable not to 
pot them all at once, as, by a little variation 
of the time of doing this, and of exciting them 
into growth, a longer succession of flowers 
will be secured. About the latter end of Oc- 
tober may be considered as the general time 
for potting the roots, and starting them into 
growth, so as to come into bloom, according 
to their respective habits, in the April and 
May following. Some may be potted and 
excited a month earlier, and others a month 
later ; and although, in consequence of the 
different periods at which the plants will be 
making their growth, there may not, and pro- 
bably will not be exactly this difference in the 
time of flowering, yet this plan will have the 
effect of prolonging the flowering period of 
these gay and beautiful plants. 

The manner of potting is thus : — Turn out 
the dry soil containing the bulbs from the old 
pots, and carefully separate from it all the 
bulbs and offsets ; the strongest of the roots 
are then to be selected for blooming ; while 
the rest are to be grown as store-roots to 
increase the stock, and come in for blooming 
in another year. The most convenient sized 
pots to use are five-inch ones, in which three 
or four strong bulbs, or five or six of but 
moderate strength, may be planted. Smaller 
pots than these — three-inch ones — will do for 
the very small growing kinds, about three roots 
of which may be planted in them. The roots 
should be placed at equal distances apart, and 
near the edge of the pots. A suitable mix- 
ture for them may be made by incorporating 
equal parts of turfy peat soil of a sandy nature 
and friable rather sandy loom ; to this about 
a fourth of the whole of decayed leaves quite 
rotted into mould may be added : this mix- 
ture should be used in medium state, between 
wet and dry — wet enough to adhere slightly 
when pressed, but dry enough to fall to pieces 



again when dropped on the potting bench. 
The pots must be thoroughly drained, because, 
when the plants are growing, they require a 
good deal of water. The bulbs should be 
placed so as to be about an inch or rather 
more beneath the surface. When the potting 
is finished, the pots may be set on any of the 
shelves in the greenhouse, where they are 
most out of the way, and here they may re- 
main until they commence growing : when 
growth is perceived they should be brought to 
some of the front stages, where they will be 
sure to obtain plenty of light, and be more 
within sight. 

Very little water should be applied after 
potting until growth commences, for the ap- 
plication of much water at the time when the 
bulbs are dormant, especially as it would be 
during the winter season, could hardly fail to 
be injurious. What is wanted by the roots 
when they are brought under excitement, is a 
very moderate degree of moisture, increased 
in quantity gradually as they become influenced 
by it, and put out roots and shoots ; if the 
soil is in the proper medium state, they will 
almost derive this supply from it, and espe- 
cially if means are taken to prevent it from 
rapidly drying by evaporation, which may be 
readily done either by laying a flat piece of 
glass on the top of the pot, or covering the 
soil with a layer of very slightly damped moss, 
either of which may be removed if the weather 
is damp, and the covering appears to favour 
mouldiness, which will be readily detected. 
There is another advantage in employing a 
flat piece of glass besides its preventing the 
evaporation of moisture : where there are any 
mice they not unfrequently rout up and even 
eat and destroy the roots, and this covering of 
glass prevents these busy little creatures from 
intruding. By the time it is found that the 
bulbs are throwing out roots, which will gene- 
rally, or, at least, ought to, precede the protru- 
sion of leaves, moderate applications of water 
may be given ; and the gradual increase of 
these supplies, as the plants progress, is all the 
special attention required until the flower stems 
are produced. It may, perhaps, be necessary 
to give a caution, that this gradually increasing 
supply of water is never to be carried to the 
point of saturating the soil: this, in fact, should 
be held as a standing rule in the growth of 
all potted plants which are not absolutely of 
an aquatic nature. The stress which is laid 
upon attention to the operation of watering, 
as the plants approach a flowering state, must 
rather be understood as implying the neces- 
sity of more and more cautiously preventing 
the soil from becoming dry. In order to 
secure this condition, more frequent supplies 
will be needed in the same ratio as the seasons, 
as well as the plants, progress. 



16 



THE IXIA AND ALLIED PLANTS- 



When the flower-stems are produced, the 
taller growing kinds will require supporting 
in an upright position by neat and slender 
stakes, which should be painted of a dull olive 
green colour, so as to be as little conspicuous 
as possible : it is not in good taste to have 
these stakes painted of a more lively green 
than that of the plants, neither is any other 
striking colour at all desirable. "While the 
plants continue in bloom, and until their 
foliage has evidently attained mature growth, 
the supply of water must be maintained ; and 
though, during the period of bloom, the plants 
may require to be placed in situations (such 
as drawing-rooms, &c.) where their decorative 
effect more than any thing else is the object, 
yet, as soon as the bloom is past, the plants 
must be placed in a situation where they will 
get as strong light as can be secured to them, 
in order that the elaborative functions of the 
leaves may prepare a store of organizable mat- 
ter for the production of flowers in the follow- 
ing year. When this object has been gained, 
and the leaves indicate a disposition to turn 
yellow, the supply of moisture must be gra- 
dually cut off until they become quite dried 
up, when the bulbs are to be left embedded 
in the dry soil. In this state, they may be 
allowed to remain on the shelves of the 
greenhouse until the season arrives for re- 
potting. 

CULTURE IN FRAMES AND PITS. 

The treatment of these plants, when kept in 
frames and pits, differs in no wise from that 
which should be followed out in the green- 
house, except in so far as the situation is con- 
cerned. The pit should be one of those — 
adapted for preserving greenhouse plants — 
which are capable of excluding frost : it 
should be quite free from damps, but as the 
roots will not be in an active state during 
winter, no provision for heating it need be 
made on their account ; they only require 
sufficient covering, according to the state of 
the weather, to exclude frost. 

As regards the general management of the 
pit, through the winter it may be kept com- 
paratively close, being opened a little in fine 
mild weather, in order to purify the interior. 
In the spring, as the plants grow, it may be 
opened a little every day while the weather is 
fine, but not so much as to chill the plants 
with cold air ; for although they may be 
grown, under certain circumstances, in the 
open ground, as will presently be explained, 
yet, when the protection of a pit is afforded to 
them, this treatment is altogether incompati- 
ble with direct exposure. In cultivating exotic 
plants of any kind, whatever course of treat 
ment is afforded should be followed out as a 



whole, and not mixed up with features which 
belong to a totally different course. Plants 
like these, therefore, to which protection has 
been throughout afforded, should not, at dif- 
ferent intervals, be too much exposed. During 
the winter, if the lights are tilted up at the 
back a couple of inches, when air is required 
to be admitted, a sufficient degree of ventila- 
tion will be afforded, and in the warmer 
weather of spring, when the plants are in a 
growing state, double this quantity would at 
any time be sufficient. 

The plants in pits will be somewhat less 
subjected to drying influences than those in 
the greenhouse, and will, consequently, re- 
quire fewer and more limited applications of 
water. If, however, the principle of applying 
water only when the soil appears to be getting 
dry is adopted, there will be little risk of ap- 
plying too much during the earlier stages of 
growth, and subsequently, when a greater 
supply is required, this risk becomes consider- 
ably lessened. 

In all other respects, such as potting, af- 
fording as much light as possible, resting, &c, 
the same treatment should be given them as 
that recommended in the greenhouse. 

GROWING IXIAS, &C, IN PROTECTED BEDS 
AND BORDERS. 

Notwithstanding that this class of plants, 
being brought from climates warmer than our 
own, requires to have the protection afforded 
by glass erections, to bring them to perfection, 
yet they may be grown so as to become very 
pretty objects, even in the open ground, pro- 
vided a dry and sheltered place is selected for 
them, and a trifling degree of protection is 
afforded them. When grown in this way, 
however, they do not spring up or bloom at 
the usual period, but just start into growth as 
the genial weather of spring excites them, 
and flower under the influence of increasing 
solar power. 

What is wanted, is not a situation remark- 
able for the amount of influence which the 
sun exerts upon it during the winter season ; 
for this would be too likely to excite the bulb3 
into growth at an earlier period than would 
be desirable. It is of far greater importance 
that the selected spot be what is termed on a 
" dry bottom ;" that is, where no superfluous 
water rests among the subsoil ; for without 
this condition there is but little hope of suc- 
cess. The danger to be anticipated from 
frost is not of any material extent, for the 
manner in which the surface of the beds 
should be covered will keep the frost from 
penetrating to the injury of the roots. The 
bad effect to be anticipated from the exciting 
influence of the sun maybe avoided by adopt- 



THE 1XIA AND ALLIED PLANTS. 



17 



ing some means of intercepting its rays during 
the earlier part of the winter ; later in the 
season this need not be attempted. Another 
means of keeping the plants from growing so 
early as to be liable to be checked by the 
frosts and cold weather of early spring, is to 
plant in situations having a northern (or at 
least not a southern) aspect ; but the disad- 
vantage of a northern aspect is, that it is there 
impossible that the plants should derive full 
advantage from the sun late in the season. 

Unless in situations peculiarly favoured, 
and possessing the advantage of a dry subsoil, 
and sheltered aspect — conditions, however, 
rarely to be met with, there is not much 
probability of their succeeding planted in a 
promiscuous manner in the flower-beds. Ge- 
nerally speaking, the trouble and attention 
which would be necessary to render this course 
successful, would hardly be repaid by the 
results. This is not the case when they are 
grown together in beds, for then the whole 
preparation can be effected at one operation, 
and the subsequent trouble of attending them 
is considerably lessened. 

In preparing a bed, something like the fol- 
lowing course should be adopted : — In the 
first place, the natural soil should be taken 
out to the depth of fifteen or eighteen inches, 
the bottom being made quite even, and in- 
clining either to the front or on one side, so 
that the moisture, if any, may find its way to 
the nearest drain. In the bottom of the bed, 
lay six or eight inches of broken bricks, and 
on these a layer of rough turfy soil ; above 
this, the bed should be filled up with prepared 
compost, as good in quality as can be ob- 
tained. If the natural soil is light and open, 
a portion of it may be retained, say one half ; 
to this should be added, a fourth of good loam, 
and a fourth of turfy peat. If the natural 
soil is sandy, this mixture will be sufficiently 
porous ; but if it is of a closer texture, enough 
sand must be added to remedy the evil. As 
much of this mixture is to be filled in, as will 
raise the bed four or five inches above the 
level of the surrounding ground. In planting, 
the roots are to be covered over about three 
inches. There are two common methods of 
planting bulbous plants ; one is to make holes 
for each bulb of the proper depth, by blunt 
dibbles, which form a hole large enough to 
drop in the root ; in ordinary cases, this is an 
objectionable plan, especially if the soil is 
heavy, or rather wetter at the time of planting 
than is desirable ; the pressure of the dibble 
forms the sides and bottom of the holes more 
or less into a compact caked mass, which pro- 
portionately arrests the percolation of water, 
to the injury of the bulb; the other plan, 
which is a far preferable one, is to draw drills 
with the drill-hoe, of the depth required, in 
49. 



the bottom of which the bulbs are set at the 
regular and proper distances, and then care- 
fully covered by returning the soil again into 
its place, leaving the surface even, so that the 
roots may be all situated at an equal depth. 
This may be done in the fine dry weather of 
autumn. After planting, the beds are to be 
covered over with a thickness of about three 
inches of dry old tan, or dry sawdust half 
decayed ; either of them will serve as an 
efficient protector, not only against frost, but 
also, in a great measure, against wet. If the 
weather becomes very wet or very severe, 
some additional portable covering should be 
employed as long as it appears necessary. 

By the latter end of March, if the weather 
is at the time at all open, -part of the covering 
of tan or sawdust may be taken off, prepara- 
tory to the removal of the whole as soon as 
mild weather becomes fairly established in 
the month of April. If from the situation of 
the bed it would be preferable, for the sake 
of appearance, to remove the whole of this 
winter covering, and substitute a lighter one 
of moss in its place, for a short time, this 
might be done without detriment to the 
plants. 

At this time of year (spring and summer) 
the plants are benefited by all the sun they 
can obtain, therefore nothing should be per- 
mitted to shade them unnecessarily in any 
way. As they grow up, some of the taller 
kind may require to have their flower-stems 
tied up to neat stakes. If the weather is very 
hot when they are in bloom, they may be 
kept in perfection for a longer period by 
shading them, but whatever covering may be 
used for the purpose should be taken off as 
soon as the bloom is over, and the plants 
exposed to the full influence of the sun. It is of 
far greater importance towards a good bloom 
in the following year, to secure a perfect 
development and ripening of the leaves, under 
the highest amount of solar influence the 
plants can be subjected to, than it is to favour 
by any means the early growth of the roots 
during autumn or winter ; indeed the latter 
course is the most impolitic one that can be 
adopted. No further attention is required 
after the decay of the foliage until the ap- 
proach of winter, when the beds must be 
again covered in a manner similar to what 
has been already recommended. The beds 
do not require replanting every year, but once 
in three or four years will be sufficient. 

RAISING FROM SEEDS AND OFFSETS. 

The former is but a simple process. It is 
only necessary to procure the seeds when 
ripe, and sow them in the ordinary manner 
immediately afterwards, using broad shallow 
pans instead of pots, and the same kind of 
e

soil, with a little more sand added, as that 
previously recommended. The pans may be 
set in a frame or pit, such as that described 
as being suited to their growth. They may 
remain here throughout the first year. The 
second year, they may be transplanted into 
other pans, in less sandy soil, and may be 
grown in these pits till they get large enough 
to bloom, when they may be treated as the 
blooming bulbs. This period may be two, 
three, or more years, just according to the 
free-growing nature of the kind or otherwise. 
There is no doubt if these plants were brought 
into that state of universal cultivation to 
which their beauty entitles them, a good deal 
would be effected by hybridizing in securing 
variety, at least, if not what might be con- 
sidered to be better flowers.

Ixia columellaris. 

Offsets from the old bulbs, which are pro- 
duced freely, should be managed in a precisely 
similar manner with the young seedling plants; 
and they will take about an equal time to 
attain a flowering state, depending of course 
a little on the strength of the offset when first 
planted* 

Of those genera which we have enumerated 
as allied to Ixia, the following summary notice 
will be sufficient as regards treatment. Ba- 
biana requires to be grown very similarly to 
Ixia ; they are generally lower-growing plants, 
and many of them are very pretty. Cypella 
requires to be grown in a warm greenhouse, 



and treated with care. Geissorluza, and 
Hesperantha, should have the greenhouse or 
pit treatment above detailed. Sparaxis, 
while it admits of being also thus grown, is a 
trifle more hardy in its nature, and therefore 
is so much better suited to be grown in shel- 
tered beds out of doors. Synnetia requires 
the treatment of Ixia. The hardy kinds of 
Trichonema may be planted in moderately 
sheltered places out-doors ; the others may be 
gi-own in the pit or in the greenhouse. Fi- 
nally, the Tritonias belong to the section 
requiring greenhouse treatment. 

All these plants, without exception, are of 
a gay and showy nature ; and a collection of 
them would possess great interest and beauty, 
if grown with moderate success. The whole 
tribe has been for many years neglected ; and 
possibly from this cause, some of the kinds 
enumerated below may not be at this moment 
in cultivation ; they are nevertheless conti- 
nually obtainable from the Cape.

THE BEST VARIETIES IN CULTIVATION OF 
TWENTY-ONE SORTS OF FLOWERS. 

Periodically it is necessary to give amateur 
florists an idea of the best subjects to cultivate, 
because when new and improved varieties ap- 
pear, they must turn out inferior ones from 
all limited collections ; and there are many 
persons who grow so few that it is of the 
highest importance to be informed now and 
then of those that keep the lead, that collec- 
tions may be corrected by the addition of 
novelties that are actually better, or different 
from, and as good as those in cultivation 
already. We are aware that there are other 
sources from which lists can be taken, but 
those which can be depended on are too large 
for small growers ; others only mislead them. 

It may be said there are other flowers 
as good as we name, but suppose there be 
some as good, and they are not better, our 
list cannot mislead ; for instance, in mention- 
ing a dozen of any thing of which there are 
hundreds, when we come towards the last, down 
to the quality of which there may be many 
equally good or bad, we can only take the 
number we want, and in such case we are 
guided by the colour or character we require 
to form the best small collection. These lists 
will be found useful to young beginners, be- 
cause it is most essential to begin with the 
best, and it is well known that young flor- 
ists have always been the dupes of the older 
and more cunning ones. 

It has been a general feeling among old 
florists, that inferior soi*ts, such as they began 
with, are good enough for beginners now ; 
but our notion is, that the young man who 
never grew a thing before ought to begin 
with the best ; and not waste his money in a 
single flower that is of second-rate character, 
while he can get enough of the first. Those 
who are growing such subjects, or any one of 
them, may consult the lists with advantage; for, 
if they find any among those named that they 
do not already cultivate, they ought to lose no 
time in procuring them. The following may 
be considered the best that can be selected of 
each tribe of flowers up to the present time.

GARDENING MEMORANDA FOR 

JANUARY.* 

Gardening operations during the winter 
months are, for the most part, confined to the 
protection of crops and plants, and the prepa- 
ration of ground for the reception of others. 
The dunging and dressing, digging, trenching, 
with occasional cleaning, are the chief kinds 
of work, and this depends greatly on the 
weather. All the tender crops require litter 
to be put on at night, and taken off in the 
morning, in fine weather, but continued in 
frost. The pits and frames in which potted 
plants are placed must also be covered with 
mats or cloths, or long straw, to keep off 
frost, and uncovered by day, unless it be very 
severe. All these winter protections are, 
more or less, injurious to crops and plants, 
and therefore should be used as little as pos- 
sible ; every thing is better for the full air 
when it is mild, so that litter, and other cover- 
ing, should be removed as early as possible 
when there is no frost, so as that plants should 
never lose daylight, if it can be avoided. The 
glasses may be taken off altogether whenever 
the weather is suitable, but the plants must 
be protected against rain and heavy falls, as 
much as against frost and bleak winds. Alte- 
rations, making new garden walks, or clumps, 
go on all through winter in favourable weather, 
and planting may be done from November to 
March; but the earlier the better, on account 
of the interruptions which occasionally stop 
every thing, such as a long interval of wet 
weather or hard frost. The stove requires 
little more than attention to the heat, which 
must be kept up uniformly; but, contrary to 
the too prevalent custom, the heat should be 
greater by daylight than by dark ; keep up 
the heat, therefore, all day, and it will bear to 
sink a few degrees, without injury to the 
plants, by night. The greenhouse and con- 
servatory should have as much air as possible 
in mild weather; and if frosty, keep the fire 
going all day, while air may, more or less, be 
given, and close all the glass, and cover the 
plants with mats by night. The forcing 
houses require constant attention to the 
fires throughout the month.

TROP^OLUM UMBELLATUM. 



Trop<solum umbellatum, Hooker (umbellate 
Indian Cress). — Tropasolaceae § Tropasolete. 

This plant is altogether distinct from any 
other species of Indian cress which has found 
its way to our gardens. Paucity of blossoms 
is by no means a character applicable to any 
of the Tropseolums ; nevertheless, in the spe- 
cies under consideration, the ordinary propor- 
tion of blossoms is quintupled, for instead of 
their being produced, as is usually the case, 
singly along the stems, in this they grow in 
the same position, but in bunches of from four 
to six together. This habit of blooming gives 
the plant an aspect altogether different from 
that of the species which are more familiar 
to us. 

Our plant has a tuberous root, which, ac- 
cording to Professor Jameson, reaches the 
weight of three to four pounds ; the plant is, 
therefore, of course perennial. The climbing 
stem is slender but fleshy ; it has, moreover, 
a zig-zag direction, and is of a purplish colour. 
The leaves, which are rather large, and some- 
what remotely situated, are sub-peltate and 
cordate, deeply cleft into five ovate obtuse 
lobes, which are mucronate when young ; they 
are attached to long flexuous petioles : the 
younger leaves on the flowering branches ap- 
pear to be generally smaller, and to have more 



the form of those of theivy, but somewhat deeply 
lobed. The flowers grow in umbels from the 
axils of the leaves, and are of singular external 
structure ; the calyx is cylindrical, with an 
erect (straight) limb of five unequal lobes, and 
continued at the base into a stout curved 
blunt spur, which is shorter than the calyx 
itself; the colour is orange-red, tipped with 
green at both extremities, the limb being yel- 
lowish ; the petals are very unequal in size, 
but are spathulate and clawed, as well as 
erect (not spreading) ; the three lower ones 
are red, projecting a little beyond the calyx ; 
the two others orange, and very minute : the 
flowers are thus, no less than the manner in 
which they are produced, very different from 
those of the other species of the genus ; they 
are produced very freely during the summer 
months — so freely, indeed, as quite overpower 
the foliage. 

It is a South American species. Professor 
Jameson, of Quito, first found it on a moun- 
tain called Pilzhum, (to which, he observes, it 
is quite peculiar,) at an elevation of 7000 feet 
above the level of the sea. For its introduc- 
tion to our gardens, however, we are indebted, 
as for several other beautiful Tropasoleas, to 
Messrs. Veitch and Son, of Exeter, who ob- 
tained it through their collector, Mr. Lobb,

probably from the same locality where it was 
found by Professor Jameson. 

From the nature of its locality, there can 
be little doubt of its proving to be amongst 
the most hardy species of the genus. The 
roots of some, at least, of the other kinds — 
those of T. pentaphyllum for example — are 
certainly hardy ; that is to say, they will stand 
uninjured in the ground during winter, and 
produce young stems again in spring, flowering 
freely in summer and autumn, provided the 
situation be fairly relieved of stagnant water, 
and the surface of the ground is covered before 
severe frost sets in with some dry protective 
material, either such as half- decayed tanner's 
bark, or fine turfy peat-earth, or, where ap- 
pearance is not much an object, a good layer 
of dry fern, or litter. Nothing could be more 
beautiful than a series of our — usually consi- 
dered — greenhouse species so treated ; and 
we should have full confidence of success in 
making such an experiment. What splendid 
additions to ordinary flower-garden creepers 
would be derived from the rich colour of 
many species of Tropaeolum. 

The Tropseolums grow exceedingly well in 
a compost consisting of the turfy portions of 
sandy loam, mixed with broken charcoal, 
liquid manure, in a clear and diluted state, 



being given to the plants, when growing, 
freely, and approaching the blooming state. 
When grown in pots, they should be planted 
at once in those in which they are to flower, as 
the trellises for the branches require to be ad- 
justed as soon as they begin to grow, after which 
it becomes exceedingly tedious and hazardous 
to attempt removing the plants from one pot to 
another. Many of the species have a strong 
tendency to grow during the winter months ; 
and if they are placed in situations where they 
can enjoy plenty of light and air, without 
being subjected to cold draughts, their growth 
is more healthy at that season than what is 
often obtained in what would be thought to 
be the more favourable period of advanced 
spring ; probably they suffer from the con- 
fined heat, and, if so, this explains how it is 
that they flourish so perfectly, under proper 
regimen, in the open air. It is by no means 
advisable to endeavour to check this winter- 
growing tendency when it becomes at all ap- 
parent in any of the tubers. 

Tropasolums are freely propagated by cut- 
tings, which, however, require some care lest 
they should be suffered to lapse into a state of 
rest before the young tubers are organized for 
their perpetuation. Seeds, whenever pro- 
duced, will originate more vigorous plants.

ing when full grown about a foot in height, 
furnished with compound leaves, the indivi- 
dual leaflets of which are heart-shaped, and 
producing an upright raceme, bearing many 
small yellowish-green flowers. It is perhaps 
one of the. best species of the genus. Sup- 
posed to be a native of Japan. Introduced 
in 1846, through M. Makoy, of Liege. 
Flowers in April. Culture. — Requires slight 
protection in winter (with other delicate alpine

spike of small whitish flowers, the sepals 
clothed, and the petals ciliated, with hairs. 
Native of the East Indies, where it grows on 
trees. Introduced about 1846. Flowers in 
autumn. It is the Stelis hirta (Smith); and 
Tribrachia hirta (Lindley). Culture. — Re- 
quires a stove ; turfy peat soil ; division of 
the plant. 

Cymeididm eburneum, Lindley (ivory 
Cymbid). — Orchidacea3 § Vandese-Brassidaa. 
— A large and very handsome perennial 
herbaceous plant. The leaves are long, narrow, 
swordshaped, and are bilobed at the end ; 
from their axils are produced the flowers, about 
two together, at the extremity of a long droop- 
ing scape ; they are very large, pure ivory- 
white, with one broad yellow stripe along the 
middle of the lip ; moreover, they are deli- 
ciously fragrant. Native of the East Indies. 
Introduced about 1846. Flowers in August 
and September. Culture. — Requires a hot 
moist stove ; turfy peat soil ; propagated by 
division of the plant. 

Sobralia macrantha, var. splendens 
(splendid large-flowered Sobralia). — Orchi- 
daceoe § Arethuseas-Vanillidaa. — The Sobra- 
lias have a reedy habit, stiff plaited leaves, 
and for the most part large splendid blossoms; 
this is the case with S. macrantha. The 
present variety differs chiefly in stature, and 
in the colour of its blossoms ; being dwarfer, 
not growing more than from two to three feet 
high, and producing large deep rich crimson- 
purple blossoms, which have a slender curved 
neck, elliptic reflexed sepals and petals, and a 
prominent rolled up (so as to appear funnel- 
shaped) lip, the lower edge of which is ex- 
panded and frilled, and the inside yellowish. 
Culture. — Requires a stove ; turfy peat and 
turfy loam; propagated by division of the plant; 
young plants are also to be obtained by enve- 
loping one of the joints of the stem with moss, 
which is to be kept constantly damp ; in this 
case the stem should be slightly cut through 
below where the moss is applied. 

Barkeria Skinneri, var. major (large- 
flowered Skinner's Barkeria). — Orchidaceaa § 
Epidendreas-Laeliadas. — This variety is much 
superior to that generally cultivated ; the 
flower scape grows nearly two feet high, bear- 
ing upwards of thirty blossoms, which are of 
a deep reddish purple-lilac colour. It is, we 
presume, a native of Mexico. Introduced 
about 1845. Flowers in autumn. Culture. — 
Requires a stove ; turfy peat soil, or to be 
fixed on a block of wood ; propagated by divi- 
sion of the plant. 

Ctpripedium Lowei, Lindley (Mr. Lowe's 
Lady's Slipper). — Orchidacese § Cypripedeoe. — 
A very beautiful addition to the epiphytal 
section of Lady's Slippers. The leaves, which 
are all produced from the root, are strap- 



shaped ; the flower-stem produces a raceme 
of from four to eight blossoms, most beautiful 
in their way ; the sepals are green, with a 
purple tinge near the base ; the petals spa- 
thulate, nearly three inches long (much longer 
than the lip), gracefully curving inwards and 
downwards, near the base of a pale greenish- 
yellow, with numerous well-defined purple 
blotches, rich violet -purple at the apex, and 
having a few stiff marginal hairs ; the oblong 
pouch-shaped lip is purplish-green, shining as 
if varnished. The cut blooms — of course 
those on the plant also — continue long in per- 
fection. Native of Borneo, where it grows on 
high trees in thick jungle, flowering in April 
and May. Introduced, in 1846, by Mr. Lowe. 
In cultivation it has flowered in October and 
November. Culture. — Requires a hot moist 
stove, and a degree of shade ; turfy peat soil, 
or to be fixed to a block of wood ; propagated 
by division of the plant. 

Dipladenia nobilis, Morren (noble Di- 
pladene). — Apocynaceas § Wrighteae. — This is 
a distinct species, and promises to make a very 
ornamental subject for cultivation ; the blos- 
soms are themselves very beautiful. It has a 
largish tuberous -like corm, from which issue 
the stems ; apparently several stems may be 
induced, and on this will depend in great 
measure the ornamental aspect of the plants ; 
these stems appear to grow from two to three 
feet long. The leaves are opposite, oblong 
acute, on very short stalks. The flowers grow 
in one-sided racemes, and are large and dis- 
tinct, the corolla being between tubular and 
campanulate, with roundish ovate spreading 
lobes. There are two distinct varieties, — one 
with a whitish limb and pink throat, the other 
entirely pink. Native of Brazil. Introduced 
in 1847. Flowers in summer and autumn. 
Culture. — Requires a stove, and bears expo- 
sure to sun ; coarse peat and sand ; pro- 
pagated by cuttings. 

Dendrobium tortile, Lindley (twisted 
Dendrobe). — Orchidacete § Malaxeae-Dendro- 
bidae. — A very beautiful species, with erect 
furrowed stems, which protrude from the 
joints a profusion of large showy flowers 
growing in threes ; the sepals are linear 
oblong, blunt, reflexed and twisted; the petals 
broader, wavy and twisted, spreading but not 
reflexed ; the lip is rolled up at the base, 
roundish, slightly rhomboidal, and finely 
notched ; these flowers are of a pale clear 
lilac, with a lemon-yellow lip, veined at the 
bottom with rich purple. It is allied to D. 
nobile. The foliage is not described. Native 
of Java. Introduced, in 1846, by Messrs. 
Veitch. Flowers in autumn. Culture. — 
Requires a stove ; turfy peat soil ; propagated 
by division of the plant. 

Agalmyla staminea, Blume (long-sta- 



GARDENIA NITIDA.

mened Agalmyla). — Gesneraceae § Cyrtandrea?- 
Didymocarpidre. — The generic name of this 
plant is derived from two Greek words, which 
signify " wood ornament " in allusion to its!de- 
corating the woods where it abounds with its 
showy blossoms. It is one of the best plants 
of this class of stove plants which has been 
introduced for some time past. The habit of 
the plant is robust, the creeping perennial 
stems rambling about the trunks of trees, 
rooting as they go ; both the stem and petioles 
are densely hairy. The leaves are large, al- 
ternate, oblong acuminate, denticulate and 
downy on the edges as well as beneath. The 



flowers are disposed in dense axillary fascicles, 
and are both large and very numerous ; they 
are tubular, and curved with a spreading limb, 
of a rich crimson colour, and velvety surface ; 
the limb is marked with dark blotches ; each 
flower has two stamens, which project consi- 
derably. Native of Java, growing in the 
mountain woods. Introduced in 1846. Flowers 
in autumn, probably at other periods. It is 
the Justicia parasitica (Lamarck) ; and the 
Cyrtandra staminea (Vahl). Culture. — Re- 
quires a stove, but probably not extreme stove 
heat ; light rich turfy soil ; propagated freely 
by cuttings in a hotbed. 




GARDENIA NITIDA. 



Gardenia nitida, Hooker (glossy-leaved 
Gardenia). — Cinchonaceae § Gardenidse. 

Several new and very striking kinds of 
Gardenias have been, within a brief period, 
introduced to our gardens; and the older kinds, 
known by the name of Cape Jasmines, are held 
in especial esteem from their powerful and 
delightful odour. The present species is a 
nevy and very distinct plant from any other 
which is known. 

It forms a dense compact sturdy evergreen 
shrub ; a flowering plant sent to Sir W. J. 
Hooker, for the purpose of being figured, was 
but two feet high and three feet across, so 
that in the mere leafy state, without flowers, 
it is an interesting plant. The leaves are 
large, oblong lanceolate, tapering to both ex- 
tremities, the base being extended into a short 
petiole ; they are wavy, very glossy, and dark 
green above, and paler beneath. The flowers 



are axillary, solitary, and stalkless ; they are, 
moreover, large, white, and deliciously fra- 
grant ; the calyx tube is an inch long, slender, 
and cylindrical, with a limb of seven spreading 
obovate or spathulate leafy segments ; the 
corolla tube is slender, cylindrical, slightly 
wider upwards, projecting much beyond the 
calyx, the limb consisting of seven very long 
oblong obtuse segments, which soon become 
reflexed, their margins being also reflexed ; 
these give the blossoms a very distinct cha- 
racter. 

Our only knowledge of the plant is derived 
from the account published in the Botanical 
Magazine, where Sir W. Hooker states that 
the plant had been received by him " from the 
stove of Messrs. Lucombe, Pince & Co. [of 
Exeter], who raised it from seeds taken from 
a dried specimen, gathered by Mr. Whitfield 
[natural history collector for the Earl of 



30 



PLUMBAGO LARPENT.E 



Derby, who also introduced some other beau- 
tiful Gardenias,] at Sierra Leone. It proves 
to be a perfectly new and most distinct species, 
possessing handsome dark g~een, glossy foliage, 
flowers among the larger of the genus, deli- 
riously scented, the calyx furnished with large 
leafy segments, the corolla of the purest white, 
its "limb cut into seven long segments, which 
are soon reflected." " Though shrubby it is 
eminently suited for 'pot culture,' and deserves 
a place in every stove. It blossoms in Octo- 
ber and November, and will probably be found 
to do so at other seasons." 

There is one point in this account which 
may deserve especial mention — it was reared 
from a seed taken out of a dried specimen. It 
is, we believe, not the only plant which our 
gardens thus owe to the chance of such bota- 
nical specimens as contain seeds falling into 
the hands of persons who care to turn them to 
account. Many ferns have certainly been so 
raised, and that often in the greatest profu- 
sion. 

The Gardenias flourish in rich turfy loam, 
well drained, and they delight in abundance of 
weak liquid manure when growing. To grow 
them successfully, they also require a hot damp 
atmosphere ; and no place is so congenial to 
them as a brisk heated dung-bed. Cuttings 
take root pretty freely planted in sand, and 
placed in a similar situation. 

PLUMBAGO LARPENT.E. 

Plumbago Larpentce, Lindley (Lady Lar- 
pent's Leadwort). — Plumbaginacese § Plum- 
bagineas. 

Blue-flowered plants, adapted for the flower- 
garden, are by no means numerous ; indeed, 
excepting the few dwarf kinds of Lobelias, 
there is hardly a good blue-flowered half-hardy 
plant which can be employed for summer de- 
coration ; and these dwarf Lobelias are too 
small to occupy many positions where blue 
flowers are required. 

What experience has been had in the growth 
of the Plumbago Larpentce tends to the conclu- 
sion that it will prove all that can be desired 
as a bedding-out plant for the flower-garden, 
for which purpose its charming blue colour 
will render it quite an acquisition. Its'adapt- 
ability for this purpose has in some measure 
been tested during the past season. In the 
Gardener's Chronicle, where the first account 
of it was published, and from whence our 
sketch is derived, it is stated, that, in the 
nursery of Messrs. Knight and Perry, of Chel- 
sea, a plant in the open ground had, in the 
month of October last, produced 4,000 blos- 
soms. 

Our subject is a sub-shrubby plant, with 
slender zig-zag stems, which are covered with 



scales and close-pressed hairs. Its leaves arc 
obovate, and sharply pointed, tapering also to 
the base, and covered with minute scales on 
each side, the margins finely serrated and also 
fringed with hairs. The flowers grow in close 
terminal heads, and are of an intense violet or 
clear deep blue colour, marked with a little 
red in the throat ; the plant, consequently, 
when growing under favourable conditions, 
becomes a very beautiful object. Besides 
these characteristics, others more minute, yet 
serving equally for the purpose of scientific 
recognition, are these : — the bracts or floral 
leaves, and the sepals or calyx segments, are 
perfectly smooth and shining, fringed with 
hairs (ciliated), but entirely destitute of glands. 

It is a native of Shanghai, in China, where, 
however, it appears to be exceedingly rare. 
Mr. Fortune found it growing on the ruined 
ramparts of that city, but the Horticultural 
Society were not successful in raising it. To 
Sir George Larpent, Bart., is due the merit of 
introducing, and to his gardener, Mr. Eyles, 
that of successfully rearing and cultivating it. 
It was sent to Sir G. Larpent, by Mr. Smith, 
in the ship Monarch, Captain Duncanson, with 
the following memorandum, dated Canton, 
May 16, 1846 :— 

" No. 6 Mr. Fortune tried to get a plant 
of, but failed : yours is, therefore, the only 
one in England. It is very rare, even at 
Shanghai ; and I found it on the city wall, 
growing out of the stone-work ; it will, there- 
lore, require good drainage. This is one of 
the most ornamental plants I have seen in 
China." The memorandum goes on to state, 
that the climate of Shanghai, though in 30° N. 
lat., is both very cold and very hot, the ther- 
mometer being sometimes as low as 30° in 
February and as high as 110° in August. 
From this it would appear that the plant is 
able to endure a considerable degree of cold ; 
it ought, in fact, if it can be kept dry enough, 
to prove hardy in our climate, but this is 
scarcely to be expected ; neither our climate, 
nor the circumstances under which it would 
usually be placed as regards moisture in the 
soil, would be likely to accord sufficiently with 
those of its native place. In our climate damp 
would certainly be the greatest obstacle to its 
successful preservation in winter. This over- 
come, there would be little further difficulty 
in its cultivation. 

The Plumbagos flourish in any light porous 
turfy soil, but in none better than where sandy 
loam preponderates. The present species 
must be particularly well drained, and not too 
freely watered. It may be propagated by 
cuttings planted in sand, and set in a mild 
hot-bed : these cuttings should, as in the case 
of other bedding plants, be planted in the latter 
part of the summer, and kept over the winter

31 



in greenhouses or dry frames until the follow- 
ing spring. 

For pot culture it will doubtless prove a 
very desirable subject. It must, in this case, 
be regularly shifted into pots containing a 
compost in which turfy loam preponderates, 
not using very large pots, and having these 




drained in an efficient manner. The plants 
should, while young, be well stopped back, the 
point of the shoots being removed as soon as 
practicable after they reach from two to three 
inches long ; this is to be continued until a 
good round head of branches is pi'oduced, and 
the plant should then be allowed to grow on 
for flowering. An allied kind, P. cajiensis, 
forms a very elegant plant under good manage- 
ment, and becomes a really desirable object 
for greenhouse decoration, from the distinct 
and soft pale blue colour of its blossoms ; this 
species being, moreover, of rather straggling 
habit, may be used as a semi-climber ; trained 
against the upright pillars of a conservatory, 
in situations pretty well exposed to light, and 
where its roots are in a healthy medium, it be- 
comes very ornamental. Whether or not the 
new species will assume any of this habit, we 
know not ; but the plant which appeared at 
one of the metropolitan exhibitions certainly 
indicated a more compact and bushy habit. 
Of course, as a pot plant, it must be very 
carefully watered. 



THE FOREST TREES OF BRITAIN.* 
BY THE REV. C. A. JOHNS. 

There is nothing that would contribute so 
much to the improvement of old plantations, 
and the formation of new ones, as the know- 
ledge of the habit, character, culture, and 
management of the trees which thrive in this 
country; and we hail with pleasure the pub- 
lication of everything calculated to familiarize 
the generality of landowners and landholders 
with this important subject. Many who have 
laid out immense sums in planting, have alto- 
gether failed in their object, and the causes 
have been various ; some from a thorough 
ignorance of the sorts likely to flourish, others 
from a mistaken notion that planting is plant- 
ing, and that trees are to be chosen according 
to the owner's, or rather the planter's, fancy. 
There have also been not a few who have 
imagined that when trees are planted their 
duty is over, and that they have no more to 
do. We know of nothing therefore so essen- 
tial as a full acquaintance with the require- 
ments, as well as the comparative value, of 
the numerous plants which may be used, that 
the planter may choose judiciously, according 
to the soil and situation of his land ; and 
when he has chosen, use all the means that 
are required to grow them to the best advan- 
tage. The subject has been often treated 
well in the Horticultural Magazine. Mr. 
Grigor's papers on many Timber and 
Ornamental Trees have been of the greatest 
service, so far as they went ; but he has not 
written upon a tenth of the kinds that are 
applicable to the various earths that prevail 
in this kingdom. The first volume of the 
work before us is an attempt to supply all 
that is wanted, and it is published for the 
society which has ushered many a useful work 
into the reading world, the " Society for 
Promoting Christian Knowledge." With ample 
means of providing the highest talent, and, 
generally speaking, " in the multitude of 
counsel, wisdom " to engage it ; a work of 
any kind has no small advantage when got up 
under their auspices. In this volume we 
have good evidence of both. In a general 
way, the descriptions of the trees, their peculiar 
characteristics, and the localities in which they 
flourish are sound. The illustrations are not 
only natural, but engraved in the most effective 
style ; some of them are highly finished, and the 
majority may be considered worthy of a place 
among the best of the highest class. Some of 
the sketches are exceedingly interesting from 
the fact of their being portraits of existing spe- 
cimens of notoriety. The author seems quite 
aware of the importance of his task; he says: —

Knowledge. Two vols. 1847.

THE FOREST TREES OF BRITAIN. 



" The author's object in preparing these 
little volumes, is to furnish the lover of nature 
with such information respecting the trees 
which are either natives of Great Britain, or 
naturalized in it, as will tend to impart addi- 
tional interest to his wanderings in the coun- 
try. The reader, therefore, must not expect 
to find the announcement of any botanical 
discovery, any suggestions of new methods of 
planting, or recommendations for the improve- 
ment of timber. If he desires information on 
these points, he is referred to the numerous 
excellent works already in existence which 
treat on these subjects. But if he be merely 
desirous of exploring the wonders of nature 
as it is displayed in the more stately vegetable 
productions of his native country, it is hoped 
that he will find in the following pages, not, 
indeed, enough to satisfy his curiosity, but to 
stimulate him to fresh research. The author 
assures him that even his own slender amount 
of scientific attainments can crowd the hedges 
and by-ways with countless miracles, which 
for the untrained eye have no being. 

" Scarcely any country in Europe is so 
favourable to the general study of the trees 
of temperate climates as England; for, with- 
out going so far as to assert that the number 
of native and introduced species exceeds that 
of all other states, it may be said with safety, 
that, whereas in most other countries the rare 
kinds are almost exclusively confined to bo- 
tanic gardens and public institutions, the 
wealth and good taste of the English gentry 
procures for all trees worthy of introduction, 
and adapted to the climate, admission into 
the numerous parks with which the whole 
land is studded ; where, without exception, 
for all purposes of observation and study, they 
are as much the property of the curious in- 
vestigator, as of the lord of the soil himself. 
Scarcely a town in England is beyond a rea- 
sonable distance of some lordly demesne, 
abounding in fine specimens of most of our 
native trees, as well as many foreign ones, to 
the former of which the author hopes to in- 
troduce hi3 readers in the following pages. 

" Technical terms have been as far as pos- 
sible avoided; but since, in describing the 
structure of a tree, it is necessary to apply to 
the several parts the conventional terms as- 
signed to each part in scientific works, it has 
been judged advisable to give a general but 
slight sketch of the anatomical structure of a 
tree belonging to the class in which all the 
British trees are comprised." — Introd. pp. ix. x. 

The introduction to the volume gives us as 
much of the physiology of vegetation as is 
necessary for the general reader ; and the 
illustrations to this portion are acceptable, 
because they are not those common-place 



examples that have become contemptible by 
their familiarity. The volume is not the 
work of a book-maker. There is no smack 
of the compilation which mars nearly all the 
modern works on gardening, botany, and even 
the treatises on simple subjects. It is a work 
after our own heart, at least as much so as 
any we have ever found. Any reader of the 
treatises which grace our volumes, will re- 
member that they are never ushered in by 
long discussions on the locality of the plant, 
or speculations on matters which do not con- 
cern the culture. It has been too much the 
fashion to precede the actual matter that is 
wanted, by long and often tedious lectures on 
botany, that have been published a hundred 
times before. The author of the present 
work has given a very concise understandable 
sketch of the anatomical structure of plants, 
which we feel more than half inclined to 
quote for its intrinsic merit. It is true that 
under the head of " Introduction" he com- 
prises a brief, but not a botanical, description 
of many of the orders, with examples and 
sketches, illustrating some leading tree be- 
longing to it ; but this is all new, it is a part 
of the subject itself. The portion of scien- 
tific matter, generally the most dry and the 
least interesting, is, as we have already ob- 
served, brief; and we like it because of its 
rare merit, — the condensation of much in little, 
and we cannot resist the temptation to quote 
a calm but sharp rap on the knuckles for the 
pompous but empty professors of the present 
day, and a just and dignified tribute to the 
genius of Linnagus, brought in, too, without 
any apparent effort, as the spontaneous effu- 
sion arising from a conviction of the great 
injustice done by the comparative worms of 
the present age to one of the greatest lights 
that ever shone on the natural history of 
vegetation. The author says, speaking of the 
organs of generation in plants, — 

" On the number, relative lengths, com- 
binations, and position of these essential 
organs, Linnasus founded his artificial system 
of the arrangement of plants, the class being 
for the most part decided by reference to the 
stamens, the order being dependent on the 
pistils. It is now unfortunately too much the 
custom to decry the system of Linnaaus, and 
to speak of his time as ' the dark age of 
botany ;' but its great inventor himself con- 
fessed it to be imperfect, and recommended it 
only as a substitute for some undiscovered 
system, which should associate plants of simi- 
lar structure ; his own method being open to 
the objection, that it brought together those 
which were not physiologically connected, and 
separated many which were closely related. 
Modern botanists have freely availed them-

selves of the discoveries of Linnaeus, and have 
undoubtedly made considerable advances to- 
wards a natural system, against which this objec- 
tion cannot be urged, but they have neglected 
to tender their acknowledgments to one who 
did more to dissipate the gloom in which the 
science of natural history was shrouded, than 
any, or even all, of his predecessors." — Introd. 
pp. xxiii. xxiv. 

The natural orders are described very 
clearly, though not at great length. The 
single example of Coniferae is as good as any 
for our purpose of showing the style in which 
it is treated ; but it must be noted that this is 
only in the Introduction ; when the trees are 
described individually, they are treated more 
elaborately. Of the order Conifera?, the 
author says, — 

" This order derives its name from the 
peculiar kind of seed-vessel, called a ' cone,' 
produced by the Fir and other allied genera. 
Conifers are distinguished by this character, 
by their needle-like leaves, by the vessels of 
their wood being perforated with numerous 
dots, and the apparently imperfect structure of 
the pistil in the perfect flower. ' No order 
can be named of more universal importance 
to mankind than this, whether we view it 
with reference to its timber or its secretions. 
Gigantic in size, rapid in growth, noble in 
aspect, robust in constitution, these trees form 
a considerable portion of woods or plantations 
in cultivated countries, and of forests where 
nature remains in temperate countries in a 
savage state. Their timber, in commerce, is 
known under th© names of deal, fir, pine, and 
cedar, and is principally the wood of the 
Spruce, the Larch, the Scotch Fir, the Wey- 
mouth Pine, and the Virginian Cedar ; but 
others are of at least equal, if not greater 
value. Pinus palustris is the Virginian Pine, 
so largely employed in the navy for masts. 
The gates of Constantinople, famous for having 
stood from the time of Constantine to that of 
Pope Eugene IV., a period of eleven hundred 
years, were of Cypress. The Norfolk Island 
Pine (A?'aticaria excelsd) and the Kaurie 
tree of New Zealand attain the height of 200 
feet, and the latter yields an invaluable, light, 
compact wood, free from knots, from which 
the finest masts in the navy are now prepared. 
But they are both surpassed by the stupen- 
dous pines of North-west America; one of 
which, Finns Lambertiana, is reported to 
attain the height of 230 feet ; and another, 
Abies Dougladi, to equal or even to exceed 
it.' {Lindley.') Great though their value be 
as timber, they are yet more valuable for 
their copious secretion of substances useful in 
the arts and sciences. Pitch, tar, turpentine, 
resin, Burgundy pitch, Hungarian balsam, Ca- 
nada balsam, &c, are furnished by some one 
49. 



or more of these trees ; and the seeds of the 
larger kinds are edible and nourishing. The 
Scotch Fir is a British example of this order. 
The Juniper, the berry-like cones of which 
are used for flavouring hollands, extends over 
the gi'eater part of Europe and North Ame- 
rica, and is likewise found in some of the moun- 
tainous parts of Asia." — ircfr'od.pp.lxxii.lxxiv. 
With one quotation, which we shall select 
for its brevity, we shall close our extracts ; 
but not without mentioning that the Oak — 
the glory of the forest — has nearly one hun- 
dred pages devoted to it, and so interspersed 
with historical records, legendary particulars, 
and engravings, as to form the most interest- 
ing part of the volume. The Mountain Ash 
is one of our most ornamental trees, and is as 
much esteemed for the showy colour of its 
fruit as for its flowers. There is perhaps 
hardly any tree that shows the author off to 
less advantage ; but in some cases it is as 
well to show the least as it is the most inter- 
esting, when the object is to show merely the 
plan. It suits our limits just now, although 
at some future period we may be tempted to 
select some passages from the Oak. 

" This universally admired tree chooses its 
dwelling, as its name would imply, in the 
wildest and most exposed situations, where, 
though impatient of being itself sheltered by 
any other kind of trees, it affords a friendly 
protection to grass and other plants which 
choose to grow beneath its shade. As long 
as it overtops its companions in the wood or 
mountain side, it is a vigorous and stately 
tree ; but when it has attained its utmost 
height, and its more aspiring neighbours begin 
to screen it from its due share of air and light, 
it quietly retires from the contest, pines away 
in confinement, and suffers itself to be de- 
stroyed by the drip of the very trees that it 
formerly nursed and protected. 

" Hence we rarely meet with a full-grown 
Mountain Ash in a crowded forest of ancient 
trees. Where it has gained the vantage- 
ground of a broken rock partially covered 
with rich, light soil, or taken its stand in an 
open glade, amid plants of humbler growth, it 
attains a considerable size. Or, again, in an 
elevated situation, uncongenial to the rapid 
growth of its companions, but well suited to 
its own wild tastes and habits, it will continue 
to flourish for a century or more. 

" The Mountain Ash , 
No eye can overlook, when 'mid a grove 
Of yet unfaded trees she lifts her head, 
Deck'd with autumnal beiries, that outshine 
Spring's richest blossoms; and ye may have marked 
By a brook side or solitary tarn, 
How she her station do!h adorn : the pool 
Glows at her feet, and all the gloomy rocks 
Are brighten'd round her. 

Wordsworth.

THE FOREST TREES OF BRITAIN. 



" The Mountain Ash is placed by most 
modern botanists in the same genus with the 
Apple and Pear, the fruit of which it resem- 
bles in conformation.* Others assign it a 
place with the Medlar, (3Iespilus,) or make 
it and the group with which it is connected a 
distinct genus (Sorbus). The name " aucu- 
paria "' (from aticeps, a fowler) indicates the 
use to which its berries are applied by bird- 
catchers in France and Germany, who bait 
their traps with them as a certain lure for 
thrushes and fieldfares. Its popular names 
are very numerous : Mountain Ash, the com- 
monest, is far from correct, as it belongs to 
an entirely different tribe from the Ash, which 
tree it resembles only in its leaves ; Rowan, 
Roan, its common name in Scotland, and 
various other forms of the same word, occur 
in old authors. It is also called Quick-Beam, 
Wild or Fowler's Service-tree : " Service " 
appears to be a corruption of Sorbus, the 
ancient Latin name of an allied species, Pyrus 
Sorbus. Witchen, Wicken, Wiggen, &c, 
evidently bear allusion to the power it was 
once supposed to possess of counteracting 
witchcraft. 

" Lightfoot and Gilpin are both of opinion 
that the Mountain Ash was held in high 
estimation by the Druids. The former says, 
' It may to this day be observed to grow more 
frequently than any other tree in the neigh- 
bourhood of those druidical circles of stones 
so often seen in the north of Britain ; and the 
superstitious still continue to retain a great 
veneration for it, which was undoubtedly 
handed down to them from early antiquity. 
They believe that any small part of this tree, 
carried about them, will prove a sovereign 
charm against all the dire effects of enchant- 
ment and witchcraft. Their cattle also, as 
well as themselves, are supposed to be pre- 
served by it from evil; for the dairy-maid 
will not forget to drive them from the sheal- 
ings, or summer pastures, with a rod of the 
Rowan-tree, which she carefully lays up over 
the door of the sheal-boothby or summer- 
house, and drives them home again with the 
same. In Strathspey, they make, on the 1st 
of May, a hoop with the wood of this tree, 
and in the evening and morning cause the 
sheep and lambs to pass through it.' 

"'In ancient days,' says Gilpin, 'when 
superstition held that place in society which 
dissipation and impiety now hold, the Moun- 
tain Ash was considered as an object of great 
veneration. Often, at this day, a stump of it 
is found in some old burying-place, or near 
the circle of a Druid temple, whose rites it

formerly invested with its sacred shade.' The 
custom of planting it in burying-grounds 
appears to have been retained after the in- 
troduction of Christianity; for Evelyn men- 
tions, that, ' in Wales, where this tree is 
reputed so sacred, there is not a churchyard 
without one of them planted in it, so, on a 
certain day in the year, everybody religiously 
wears a cross made of the wood.' In the Isle 
of Man, also, it is up to the present day 
invested by the superstitious with a sacred 
character. On Good Friday, when no iron 
of any kind must be put into the fire, and 
even the tongs are laid aside, lest any person 
should unfortunately forget the custom, and 
stir the fire with them, a stick of the Rowan- 
tree is used by way of substitute.* 

" The belief in the efficacy of the Mountain 
Ash, as a preservative against witchcraft, has 
led some commentators on Shakspeare to sub- 
stitute, for the puzzling expression in ' Mac- 
beth,' ' Aroint thee, witch !' the words, ' A 
Roan-tree witch !' The passage being thus 
uttered, the mention of a tree so fatal to the 
power of the witch might naturally excite her 
acrimony against the person who applied the 
test. The authoress of 'Sylvan Sketches' 
quotes a stanza from a very ancient song, 
which runs as follows : — 

Their spells were vain; the boys returned 

To the queen in sorrowful mood, 
Crying, that ' witches have no power 

Where there is Roaa-tree wood.' 

" In remote districts of England the super- 
stition has not even yet died away. Waterton, 
in his 'Essays on Natural History,' relates an 
anecdote which fell under his personal obser- 
vation, of a countryman in Yorkshire, who 
' cut a bundle of Wiggin, and nailed the 
branches all up and down the cow-house,' in 
order to counteract the effect produced on 
his cow by the ' overlooking ' of a supposed 
witch. 

" It is not a little singular, that, in like 
manner as we saw similar superstitious 
practices holding in Ireland and the East with 
regard to the Hawthorn and a tree closely 
resembling it, so we find in India a tree 
bearing a strong resemblance to the Mountain 
Ash, to which the same superstition attaches. 

" Bishop Heber, in the 18th chapter of 
his ' Indial Journal,' gives the following ac- 
count of this tree, and the superstition con- 
nected with it : — ' As I returned home, I 
passed a fine tree of the Mimosa, with leaves, 
at a little distance, so much resembling those 
of the Mountain Ash, that I was for a moment 
deceived, and asked if it did not bring fruit ? 
They answered no ; but it was a very noble

tree, being called " the Imperial tree" from its 
excellent properties, — that it slept all night,* 
and wakened and was alive all day, with- 
drawing its leaves if any one attempted to 
touch them. Above all, however, it was 
useful as a preservative against magic ; a 
sprig worn in the turban, or suspended over 
the bed, was a perfect security against all 
spells, evil eye, &c, insomuch that the most 
formidable wizard would not, if he could help 
it, approach its shade. One, indeed, they 
said, who was very renowned for his power 
of killing plants, and drying up their sap with 
a look, had come to this very tree and gazed 
on it intently ; " but," said the old man who 
told me this, with an air of triumph, "look as 
he might, he could do the tree no harm !" a 
fact of which I made no question. I was 
amused and surprised to find the superstition 
which, in England and Scotland, attaches to 
the Rowan-tree, here applied to a tree of 
nearly similar form. Which nation has been 
in this the imitator, or from what common 
centre are all these common notions derived ?' 
" The Mountain Ash is found in a native 
state throughout the whole of Europe, and in 
several of the northern countries of Asia and 
North America. The parts of Great Britain 
where it attains its largest size are the Western 
Highlands and the western coast of Scotland. 
On the hills of Cheshire and Derbyshire it 
does not often attain a great size : in such 
situations an entire tree, with roots, leaves, 
and flowers, is sometimes found not more 
than nine inches high. Ordinarily it grows 
very rapidly during the first five years of its 
existence, and at the age of twenty years 
forms a tree of the same number of feet, with 
a single erect stem and a bushy head. The 
branches are smooth, and vary in colour from 
grey to purplish-brown. The buds, before 
their expansion in the beginning of April, 
are large and downy. The leaves consist of 
from seven to nine pairs of narrow, acute, 
notched leaflets, terminated by an odd one. 
These are somewhat downy underneath in 
their young state, but soon become quite 
smooth. The flowers are numerous, resem- 
bling in shape those of the Pear, but much 
smaller ; in odour, those of the least fragrant 
varieties of Hawthorn. In early summer they 
are conspicuous from their number, and ar- 
rangement in large white clusters ; when these 
are shed, the tree is still a pleasing object, 
from the brightness and elegant shape of its 
leaves. As autumn advances, it asserts its 

* Most plants of the Acacia tribe, which have com- 
pound leaves like the Ash, fold the leaflets together 
during the night, thus protecting their upper surfaces 
from the cold and damp. The same property resides 
in clover, and several other English plants of the same 
natural order. 



claim to be considered a fruit-tree, in appear- 
ance, if not for utility. Its flowers are th<-n 
succeeded by numerous bunches of coral-red 
berries, which, until devoured by the Thrush 
and Storm-cock, or scattered by the equinoc- 
tial gales, infallibly distinguish it from every 
other tenant either of the wood or the park. 
' In the Scottish Highlands, on some rocky 
mountain covered with dark Pines and 
waving Birch, which cast a solemn gloom 
over the lake below, a few Mountain Ashes 
joining in a clump, and mixing with them, 
have a fine effect. In summer the light-green 
tint of their foliage, and in autumn the glow- 
ing berries which hang clustering upon them, 
contrast beautifully with the deeper green of 
the Pines ; and if they are happily blended, 
and not in too large a proportion, they add 
some of the most picturesque furniture with 
which the sides of those rugged mountains 
are invested.'* 

" A variety is cultivated which has yellow 
berries, and another with variegated leaves ; 
but neither of these, as is the case with many 
other treasured rarities, has anything beyond 
its rarity to recommend it. 

" The berries, besides being applied to the 
use from which the tree derives its name, 
' Bird-catcher's Service,' are eaten in the 
extreme north of Europe as fruit, though not, 
one would suppose, until every other kind of 
attainable fruit is exhausted, for they are in- 
tensely acid, and possess a peculiar flavour, 
which makes them very unpalatable. In sea- 
sons of scarcity, it is said that they are 
sometimes dried and ground into flour. 
' Some,' says Evelyn, ' highly commend the 
juice of the berries, which, fermenting of 
itself, if well preserved, makes an excellent 
drink against the spleen and scurvy. Ale and 
beer brewed with these berries when ripe, is 
an incomparable drink, familiar in Wales.' 
A beverage resembling perry is still made 
from them in that country, and is much used 
by the poor. In Kamtschatha and in the 
Scottish Highlands an ardent spirit is dis- 
tilled from them, which is said to have a fine 
flavour. 

" As a timber-tree, the Mountain Ash does 
not attain a size which renders it available by 
the carpenter ; but its wood, being fine- 
grained, hard, and susceptible of a high polish, 
is used for smaller manufactures, principally 
in turnery. As coppice it may be applied to 
most of the uses ot Ash, Hazel, &c. ; and the 
hark is employed by the tanner. In the days 
of archery it ranked next to the Yew as a 
material for bows, and was considered suffi- 
ciently important to be mentioned in a statute 
of Henry VIII."— Pp. 277—286.

THIBAUDIA PINCHIXCHENSTS. 



"We have simply now to give all praise to 
the general getting up of the volume. It is 
neat, and worthy of a place on the drawing- 
room table, as well as in the library. The 



embellishments are amusing and instructive, 
many of them of deep local, and some of 
general interest ; and we should like to see it 
J in everybody's hands. 




THIBAUDIA PINCHINCHENSIS. 



Thibaudia pinchinchensis, Bentham (Pin- 
chincha Thibaudia), var. glabra. — Vaccin- 
iaceaa. 

The genus Thibaudia is an extensive 
one, occurring chiefly in South America and 
Mexico, though, in some instances, native of 
the East Indies. Notwithstanding that it 
contains many plants of great beauty, compa- 
ratively few are known in a state of cultiva- 
tion, a circumstance much to be regretted. It 
was named by Pavon, in commemoration of 
Thiebaut de Burneaud, who held the office of 
Secretary to the Linnaean Society of Paris, 
and was the author of some botanical memoirs. 
The species of Thibaudia are evergreen shrubs 
remarkable for the elegance of their blossoms. 

Thibaudia pinchinchensis, which does not 
appear to be yet introduced in a living state, 
is a shrub with somewhat angular branches, 
oval-oblong acuminate leaves on short petioles, 
and axillary racemes of flowers, which are 
shorter than the leaves. 



The variety glabra, represented in the en- 
graving, differs primarily, as the name sug- 
gests, in being destitute of a certain degree of 
scurfy hairiness present in the species. It is 
an eminently beautiful shrub : in the flower- 
ing plant at Kew about two feet high, but 
growing several feet high in its native locali- 
ties. The leaves are alternate, on short pe- 
tioles, oblong-ovate, acuminate, between cori- 
aceous and fleshy, and either entirely glabrous, 
or having only a very few short scattered palea- 
ceous hairs; the nerves of the leaves besides the 
midrib, consist of two on each side from below 
the middle, generally but not always opposite. 
The flowers grow in axillary and sub- terminal 
racemes of from four to six or more together ; 
the calyx, together with the adherent ovary, 
is red, turbinate, and quite glabrous, the limb 
cut into five short triangular teeth ; the 
corolla is nearly an inch long, shaped like a 
slightly swollen tube, with a limb of five equal 
somewhat spreading teeth ; it is of a waxy

texture, and deep rose-red colour, paler at the 
mouth : the whole flower, including calyx and 
corolla, all rose coloured, is rather over an inch 
in length. 

The plant under notice was obtained from 
the elevated mountains of Columbia, whence 
seeds were sent by Mr. Purdie to the Royal 
garden at Kew, and also to Syon, at which 
last place it first flowered in a greenhouse, in 
September 1847. Mr. Bentham's T.pinchin- 
chensis was gathered by Hartweg, on the west 
side of Pinchincha. 

It is a handsome greenhouse shrub, and 
should be grown in a compost of three parts 
turfy peat, and one part turfy loam, with an 
admixture of sharp silver sand, in sufficient 
quantity to render the whole mass porous. In 
regard to potting, they should be managed 
similarly to heaths ; and it is best to give 
them moderate shifts into pots a size or two 
larger than those they are taken out of, rather 
than to place them in very large pots : like 
heaths, too, they must be well drained, broken 
charcoal being laid beneath and amongst the 
compost ; and, moreover, they must be very 
attentively watered, so th&tthey never want, nor 
are ever saturated. Cuttings of the young 
shoots, when they have become a little firm, 
take root, if planted in sand, and placed under 
a bell glass, in a moderate degree of heat. 

GLENN y's GARDEN ALMANAC. 

The present pocket volume is such a mani- 
fest improvement on all its predecessors, that, 
except for the usual lists of the best fruit, 
flowers, plants, and vegetables, and the plain, 
straightforward, blunt and somewhat uncour- 
teous style, we should hardly recognise it. 
The calendar of the months, with the rising 
and setting of the sun and moon, and the 
aspects of the planets, are the most complete 
of all the almanacks of the year, and are per- 
fect specimens of elaborate calculation and 
neat typography. There are some novel and 
useful tables, got up in excellent style, and a 
large quantity of miscellaneous useful matter. 
The predictions of the weather are new, and 
the Editor pretends to no other merit than 
that of having met the taste of the public for 
this kind of speculation, by employing the best 
talent that could be had for that department. 
There is an article on " The influence of the 
Moon on vegetation," which is so inviting, that 
we take the liberty of borrowing largely from 
it. The author of this paper says : — 

" "We certainly believe in the influence of 
the Moon, not only on the earth's atmosphere, 
but on the earth itself; not, however, on ac- 
count of this ' opinion so universal and popu- 
lar,' but from observation and experience. It 
is well known that there are hundreds of in- 



telligent agriculturists who firmly believe in 
astral influence, and they are careful not to 
have their cattle castrated when the Moon is 
approaching, or on the meridian, or when she 
is in the zodiacal sign Scorpio, because they 
well know that the animal, in ten cases out of 
twelve, does not survive the c peration. We 
could name two or three first-rate surgeons 
who will never perform an operation when the 
Moon is on, or near the meridian, or when she 
is in the zodiacal sign that rules the member 
which is to be operated upon. Ramsay, an 
author who wrote about the year 1650, speak- 
ing of the influence of the Moon, says, ' More- 
over, there is no herb nor fruit, that is either 
set or sown in the wane of the Moon, but the 
taste thereof is neither so good as naturally the 
fruit is, nor so kindly ; so also that vines may 
not spread and grow too fast, and be too for- 
ward, they are pruned and cut in the wane ; 
and such timber or wood which we desire to 
keep long unwormeaten, we cut in the wane ; 
for that then the Moon's light being abated, so 
is the sap and humidity of the tree, which 
causeth corruption being once lopt ; thus 
much concerning what we would not have 
grow ; but as touching such vegetables as we 
would have increase, it is but observing the 
Moon contrai'iwise, and we shall accomplish 
our desires therein ; as if we be desired any 
thing should grow up in height, we take care 
she be at the time of setting or sowing thereof 
increasing in light and motion, and in an aiery 
sign ;* but contrariwise, if to take deep root 
and grow downwards, we place her in an 
earthy -f sign.' Thus far Ramsey : now let 
us hear what Mr. Montgomery Martin says 
concerning lunar influence in his History of 
the British Colonies : ' In considering,' says 
he, ' the climate of tropical countries, the in- 
fluence of the Moon seems to be entirely over- 
looked ; and, surely, if the tides of the vast 
ocean are raised from their fathomless bed by 
lunar power, it is not too much to assert that 
the tides of the atmosphere are liable to simi- 
lar influence ; this much is certain, that, in 
the low land of tropical countries, no attentive 
observer of nature will fail to witness the 
power exercised by the Moon over the seasons, 
and over animal and vegetable nature. As 
regards the latter, it may be stated that there 
are certainly thirteen Springs and thirteen 
Autumns in Demerara in the year ; for so 
many times does the sap of trees ascend to 
the branches and descend to the roots. For 
example, the wallaba, (a resinous tree, com- 
mon in the Demerara woods, somewhat re- 
sembling mahogany,) if cut down in the dark

a few days before the new moon, is one of the 
most durable woods in the world for house- 
building, posts, &c. ; in that state, attempt to 
split it, and, with the utmost difficulty, it 
would be riven in the most, jagged and unequal 
manner that can be imagined. Cut down 
another wallaba (that grew within a few yards 
of the former) at the full moon, and the 
tree can be easily split into the finest smooth 
shingles of any desired thickness, or into staves 
for making casks ; but in this state, applied to 
house-building purposes, it speedily decays. 
Again, — bamboos as thick as a man's arm are 
sometimes used for paling, &c. : if cut at the 
dark moon, they will invariably endure for 
ten or twelve years; if at the full moon, j 
they will be rotten in two or three years; 
thus it is with most, if not all the forest 
trees. Of the effects of the Moon on animal 
life, very many instances could be cited. I 
have seen in Africa newly young perish in a 
few hours at the mother's side, when exposed 
to the rays of the full moon. Fish become 
rapidly putrid, and meat, if left exposed, in- 
curable or unpreservable by salt ; the mariner, 
heedlessly sleeping on the deck, becoming 
afflicted with nyctolopia, or night-blindness ; 
at times the face hideously swollen if exposed 
during sleep to the Moon's rays. The maniac's 
paroxysms renewed with fearful vigour at the 
full and change ; and the cold, damp chill of 
the ague supervening on the ascendency of 
this apparently mild, yet powerful luminary. 
Let her influence over this earth be studied, — 
it is more powerful than is ge?ieral!y 
known.' 

" This is the testimony of a gentleman who 
speaks from actual experience, and who, in all 
probability, went to Demerara with as little 
faith in lunar influence as have many of our 
modern groping philosophers in England. 
Among the believers in stellar influence are 
to be found ' some of the clearest-headed men 
in England.' Indeed it is no difficult matter 
to prove that some of the master minds of this 
and other countries were firm believers in 
astral influence. Such men, for instance, as 
Zoroaster, Josephus, Thales, Anaximander, 
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato, Eu- 
doxus, Hippocrates, Proclus, Pliny, Galen, 
Virgil, Horace, Claudius, Ptolemy, Mercurius 
Trismegistus, Haly, Alphard, Albumazar, 
Roger Bacon, Melancthon, Cardan, Lord 
Bacon, Tycho Brahe, Baron Napier, Cornelius 
Agrippa, James Usher, Archbishop of Ar- 
magh, Bishop Robert Hall, Dryden, Sir Mat- 
thew Hale, Sir George Wharton, Placidus de 
Titus, Sir Christopher Heydon, George Wit- 
chel, Astronomer Royal, Portsmouth ; Elias 
Ashmole, founder of the Museum ; Dr. Hut- 
ton, ard Professor Simpson; and hundreds 
more might be mentioned. We submit the 



following to practical men, to be disproved if 
possible, — -fiat experi mention: — 

" 1. Vines, if pinned when the Moon is 
increasing in light, will shoot out, spread, and 
grow fast, particularly if it be done in the 
second quarter, because, as the light of the 
Moon increases, so does the sap in the tree. 

" 2. Vines, if pruned while the Moon is 
decreasing in light, will not spread nor grow 
fast, particularly if it be done during the last 
quarter, because the sap decreases with the 
light. 

""3. Timber cut down while the Moon is 
increasing, will soon become rotten, particu- 
larly if she be in the second quarter. 

" 4. Timber cut down when the Moon is 
decreasing, will last for years, and the more 
durable it will be if cut down during the last 
quarter.* 

" 5. Peas sown during the Moon's increase 
will bloom to the last, and will be full and rich 
in flavour ; still more certain if sown during 
the second quarter. 

" 6. Peas sown when the Moon is decreas- 
ing in light will be just in the opposite condi- 
tion. 

" 7. The age to which a pomegranate will 
live depends on the Moon's age at the time of 
planting ; it will live just as many years as 
the Moon was days old. 

" 8. Plants and shrubs shoot up and take 
little root if planted when the Moon is increas- 
ing in light, and in the zodiacal signs Gemini, 
Libra, or Aquarius. 

" 9. If planted when the Moon is decreas- 
ing in the signs Taurus, Virgo, or Capricornus, 
they take deep root and do not grow tall." — 
Pp. 23—26. 

An article on the influence of light is equally 
interesting, but we must wait for another 
number and give it whole. A very extraordi- 
nary paper on sun-dials, and an especial notice 
of the sun-dial of Ahaz, has some claim to 
originality, and the examples of various cal- 
culations that interest the scientific world are 
worthy of notice. The list of fruits worthy 
of cultivation in every garden gives us a good 
idea of the tricks of the trade ; each fruit is 
given with its proper name, and to this is 
added all the other names by which the same 
fruit is sold by different nurseries, and in too 
many instances by a single dealer ; some of 
the popular subjects in apples, pears, peaches, 
and nectarines, have eight or ten different de- 
signations, so that a person, from a common 
trade catalogue, may order twenty- four kinds 
and find himself burthened by the same thing 
under many different names. The aim of the

rule we should hear nothing of the dry rot in the 
British Navy, and a saving of from four to five 
hundred thousand pounds per year might be effected.

Editor is to lessen the difficulties of an 
amateur, by giving him a dozen or two of 
really good things, the worst of which is good, 
and so assist him in forming a collection of the 
best things only. The Calendar of Operations for 
each month in the year is not very materially 
altered from last year, hut the lists are changed 
by striking out some of the worst and insert- 
ing some of the new things that have beaten 
them. To the amateur gardener it will be 
found absolutely necessary. There are some 
short notices of flowers, horticultural buildings, 



trellises, rustic work, fountains, and other 
subjects, embellished with wood engravings. 
That on fountains we quote for its simplicity. 
It is very roughly illustrated by what appears 
a pen-and-ink drawing, and the artist has cer- 
tainly not endeavoured to make the slightest 
improvement. This was thoughtless and un- 
wise, because the subject is one in which 
there was room to make a pretty sketch. It is, 
however, just as useful as a diagram, and 
we give it to illustrate the paper, which is 
very short and to the purpose — 



"simple method of making a fountain. 




*' By placing a Avater-butt at a considerable 
elevation, out of sight — as behind a wall, or in 
an upper room in an out-house, or any where 
else — and having a pipe from the bottom to 
any spot you like, you have a fountain : the 
elevation can always be increased by forming 
a valley below it. There is no difficulty in 
adding three or four or more feet to the rise of 
water, by sinking the ground into a hollow : 
then it should be also recollected, that by the 
jet being close to the surface, the stream of 
water is lengthened ; for, if there were a de- 
sign three feet high, it would be so much 
taken from the rise ; say, a jet throws up six 
feet from the surface of the basin, a three -foot 
figure would only throw the same stream up 
three feet. This simple machinery explains 
that a fountain requires nothing but a head of 
water ; and that, whether this is carried out 
with a tub or a reservoir of miles in extent, the 
principle is the same. But when water is 
laid on by water-companies, there is sufficient 
force for any thing ; and it may be laid into 
the jets at once. 

" A, section of wall ; B, water-butt ; C, 
pipe carried under-ground to fountain." — P. 94. 

As we give our own list and description of 
new Dahlias, we shall not quote that feature, 
but the Editor gives us to understand that 
there are scarcely any first-rate varieties, and, 
from his description, there seems to be a 
number of flowers which may be classed as 
useful without any marked excellence. Upon 



the whole, the Almanack for 1848 is by very 
much the best of the series, and the first in 
which the astrological portion has been worthy 
of the rest of the book, which contains a com- 
plete manual of gardening. The Editor is 
bent upon opposing certain people, for the 
sake of opposition, or his notions honestly 
differ from many. For instance, we observe 
that he boldly asserts that Mr. Whale's tipped 
flower Delight is the best flower of the season, 
although it was rejected altogether at the 
Surrey Gardens. He did the same by the 
Marchioness Cornwallis, and also by Keyne's 
Standard of Perfection, both of which were re- 
jected in the same way, and by the same 
judges. He proved right in the other two, 
and may in this. But he was as much op- 
posed to two other flowers selected for honours 
by the same judges. Bianca and Model were 
both pronounced by them to be first-class 
flowers, and he denounced them as altogether 
worthless ; and in both instances he was right. 
The florists must account for these discrepan- 
cies their own way ; we only state the facts.

portion of the rich fertilizing salts contained 
in the manure. One gallon of this liquid, 
mixed with three gallons of soft well aerated 
water, is an excellent preparation for all plants 
requiring liquid manure. 

Pixus Bexthamiaxa. — Mr. Hartweg has 
recently met with this species of pine in Cali- 
fornia ; and, as it appears to be a new and 
distinct kind, has named it in compliment to 
G. Bentham, Esq. He describes it thus : — 

The leaves of this species stand in threes, 
and are longer than the cones, usually eleven 
inches in length ; the cones are five inches 
long, by two inches and a half at the broadest 
point, of a reddish brown colour, the centre of 
the scales terminating in a small sharp point 
bent downwards. The trees rise to the height 
of a hundred feet, with a stem three to four 
feet in diameter, producing the cones in clus- 
ters of three or four, which ripen in September, 
or in about eight months from the time of 
flowering." 

Trailing peach trees. — Professor Du 
Breuil, of Rouen, proposes the following plan 
of training peach trees. A wavy central 
stem is first provided. When young this 
stem is bent first to the left and then to the 
right. Where it commences to turn from 
left to right, a shoot is encouraged on the 
outside of the bend, and trained straight to 
the left in a direction a little above the hori- 
zontal. Where the stem is again turned from 
right to left, another branch is extended to 
the right ; and so branches are produced al- 
ternately on either side from every outward 
bend till the wall is covered. The systems 
recommended by Hitt and Hayward, intro- 
duced upright wavy main stems, but in both 
these there are two straight naked stems, pro- 
ceeding in opposite directions, elevated at an 
angle of forty-five degrees, and four feet and 
a half in length, before these upright stems 
commence. The great objection to these 
plans is, that the long naked stems invariably 
become scorched on the exposed sides, from 
which the trees suffer severely. In the plan 
above noticed this objection is avoided; be- 
sides, the wall is furnished from top to bottom 
instead of being unfurnished in the lower four 
feet, as according to the systems of Hitt and 
Hayward. The method is recommended by 
Mr. Thompson, Superintendent of the Fruit 
department in the Horticultural Society's 
garden, as deserving of trial in Britain.

may be seen a cheaply constructed wall for 
fruit trees, which might often be imitated 
where brick or stone walls would be considered 
too expensive. The Avail alluded to has a stone 
foundation, carried up a little above the sur- 
face ; the rest is composed of a mixture of 
clay, straw, and a little chalk — forming, in 



fact, a kind of mud wall. These walls are 
found to answer the purpose at Rouen, and 
similar walls, when properly made, stand very 
well in our climate, and would doubtless be 
useful appendages to many gardens. The 
example above alluded to, at Rouen, is about 
eighteen inches thick, and ten feet high, and 
is surmounted by a coping of slate which pro- 
jects several inches. It has been built six or 
seven years, and is in good condition. Such 
walls must, of course, be constructed in sum- 
mer, so as to admit of their becoming well 
dried before winter. The trees must also be 
trained to wires or trellis work, as such walls 
will not admit of their being nailed to them. 

Substitute for Tea. — Mr. Neumann, one 
of the principal Superintendents in the Jardin 
des Plantes, at Paris, states, that, in the Mau- 
ritius, where he for some time resided, the 
leaves of Aerides odoratum are used as tea, a 
very few of the leaves being sufficient for in- 
fusion. Mr. Thompson, who records this in 
the Journal of the Horticultural Society, 
states, that he had supposed, when thus in- 
formed, that the plant was merely employed to 
impart a particular flavour to the tea, but was 
subsequently assured that the leaves of the 
Aerides were employed without any other 
along with them. 

Pixe Apples in the open ground. — At 
Bicton, in Devonshire, the seat of Lady Rolle, 
her ladyship's gardener, Mr. James Barnes, 
planted out, during the past spring, among 
the vegetables in the open garden, a quantity 
of pine apple plants which had attained a 
fruiting size ; these plants were of different 
kinds, but chiefly of the variety called the 
Queen. Referring to these plants, in a letter 
dated about the end of June, Mr. Barnes 
remarks, that, " notwithstanding the cold and 
drenching rains, and the continued morning 
frosts, the fruit continues to swell beyond my 
expectation, and, if we get some sun, we shall 
have a lot of pretty fruit. Queens, according 
to present measurement, are likely to go from 
three to four and a half pounds." One of 
these fruits, sent to the exhibition of the 
Royal Botanic Society on July 7, weighed 
4 lbs. 2 oz. ; and though inferior, of course, to 
fruit swelled under more favourable circum- 
stances, it was by no means a bad-looking 
fruit ; the leaves and crown, however, were 
rather rusty. Mr. Barnes' experiment is 
not, of course, likely to lead to any results so 
far as regards the cultivation of pine apples 
out-door^ — even in the climate of Devonshire; 
but it proves that they may be grown — and 
not unsuccessfully — in a lower temperature 
than is usually afforded them ; and by the aid 
of cheap glass many persons might grow them 
in pits with comparatively little trouble and 
expense.

Vegetable Fecundation. — This is one of 
the unsettled points of vegetable physiology ; 
and theories almost diametrically opposed are 
maintained in reference thereto by " the doc- 
tors." A general opinion is, that the pollen 
emits a slender tube, which, passing from the 
stigma to the ovary, conveys a material vivify- 
ing substance into the ovules ; and that, to 
effect fertilization, it is absolutely necessary 
for the pollen to be put into communication 
with the foramen of the ovule through the 
intervention of the conducting tissue of the 
stigma. A celebrated microscopic observer, 
Professor Amici, of Florence, has recently, by 
a minute examination of several species of 
Orchis, endeavoured to prove the existence of 
the essential part of the embryo anterior to the 
application of the pollen, which, according to 
him, acts as the specific stimulus to its deve- 
lopment. This view receives great support 
from some singular exceptions to the general 
law of fecundation. Of these, the most strik- 
ing occurs in a New Holland shrub, which has 
been cultivated several years in the Botanic 
Garden at Kew ; and which, though producing 
female flowers only, has constantly ripened 
seeds from which plants have been raised per- 
fectly resembling the parent : while yet there 
is no suspicion either of the presence of male 
flowers in the same plant, or of minute stamina 
in the female flower itself, nor of fecundation 
by any related plant cultivated along with it. 
This plant has been figured and described in 
a recent volume of the Linnaean Society's 
Transactions, under the name of Ccelebogyne 
ilicifolia, by Mr. J. Smith, the intelligent 
curator of the Kew Garden, by whom, indeed, 
this remarkable fact was first noticed. Male 
flowers of the Ccelebogyne have lately been 
discovered in New Holland, unquestionably 
of the same species. Professor Gasparini, of 
Naples, has more recently made various obser- 
vations and experiments on the cultivated fig, 
which, though entirely destitute of male 
flowers, produced seeds having a perfectly 
developed embryo, independent of fecunda- 
tion ; access to the pollen of the wild fig, 
generally supposed to be carried by insects, 
being, in his experiments, prevented by the 
early and complete shutting up of the only 
channel in the fig by which it could be intro- 
duced. 

Large Hawthorns. — In an old farm-yard 
fence at Winmarty, near Garstang, the pro- 
perty of Wilson Patten, Esq., M.P., are some 
line old trees of the hawthorn {Cratcegtis 
Oxyacantha). They are from thirty to forty 
feet high, with stems from twelve to fifteen 
inches in diameter. Specimens of so large a 
size as this are rare : and must have a most 
beautiful effect when in bloom. 

Gold-striped Periwinkle. — The only 



hardy plant which approaches the tracery of 
the exquisitely marked Ancectochilus setaceus 
— whose leaves have not unaptly been com- 
pared to veins of gold flowing over a texture 
of green velvet — is the golden-striped variety 
of the greater Periwinkle ( Vinca major,) 
whose dark green leaves during the early 
spring and summer months are very finely 
marked with golden veins extending over 
their entire surface. The plant being per- 
fectly hardy, thriving in ordinary soil, and 
vegetating early, will be found valuable for 
picturesque effect amongst early forced plants 
in the conservatory and greenhouse, or as 
portable specimens in pots for the open bor- 
ders, either singly or otherwise. Its variega- 
tion is, in many instances, so beautifully dis- 
tinct as to be adapted for the earliest bouquets 
of spring flowers. 

Popular Flowers. — It has invariably 
happened to all modern races of Florists' 
Flowers, that they have been the rage for a 
few years, and then have dropped in estima- 
tion as fast as they rose. Dahlias, pansies, 
calceolarias, are so many examples of this 
change of taste. From being universally ad- 
mired, and exciting a little frenzy among 
gardeners, they now hardly draw a passing 
regard, unless their qualities are of a marvel- 
lous order, and hardly then. The secret is, 
that the varieties are too similar. The 
breeders of Pelargoniums may expect a simi- 
lar loss of public favour, unless they can vary 
their sorts. The eye wearies of symmetrical 
forms which are all alike, except in the micro- 
scopical gaze of a profound connoisseur ; and 
when the novelty is gone, the Pelargonium, 
like other beautiful but insipid things, will be 
cast off and doomed to neglect. — Gard. Chron. 

Economical Greenhouses. — Mr. Rivers, 
nurseryman of Sawbridgeworth, has adopted 
a very inexpensive style of constructing the 
various buildings on his establishment ; and 
as similar erections might be turned to advan- 
tage in most gardens, whether large or small, 
it may be interesting to quote the annexed 
description of them from the Gardener's 
Journal: — "Mr. Rivers has built extensive 
sheds with asphalte walls and roofs. He has 
also built sheds of various sizes with asphalte 
walls and glass roofs, in form resembling what 
ai*e usually called lean-to forcing-houses. The 
front and back walls consist of upright posts 
of larch, cut once down ; one end is let into 
the ground, and the upper ends are cut even, 
and upon them a wall-plate is laid. These 
upright larch poles are two or three feet apart: 
the cut side faces outwards, and upon this is 
nailed a double coating of asphalte. The front 
wall is constructed in like manner, only lower, 
so that the roof assumes the ordinary slope 
given to greenhouses. In the front and back 



42 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



walls are placed horizontal sliding ventilators, 
the roof being fixed. The wood-work in the 
roof consists of a series of uniform rafters, 
formed of deal quartering, three by two and a 
half inches ; this, though of very large size, is 
rabbeted out by machinery, at the saw-mill, into 
the usual form of the sash-bars in ordinary 
glass frames. These rafters or sash-bars are 
fixed at the top and bottom, at twelve inches 
apart, and into them is fixed the glass in the 
usual way. Mr. Rivers finds these structures 
answer for horticultural purposes of every de- 
scription, — even the forcing of Roses, Vines, 
and the most delicate of plants. A house 
fifty-four feet long by twelve wide, Mr. Rivers 
states, may be built, including every cost, for 
under 40/." In every garden where choice 
flowers are prized in the flower-garden, a 
building of this description would be just 
suited to raise a supply of plants to produce 
them ; and wherever delicate, or early, or late 
vegetables were required, low buildings of this 
kind would prove invaluable. Of course, the 
buildings in the form alluded to above, are not 
very ornamental. 

TkoPuEOLUIi tricolor. — This plant is 
somewhat difficult to propagate, not that cut- 
tings may not be readily induced to form 
roots, but the young plants thus raised are 
often very slow in producing those tubers by 
which the species is continued from one season 
to another. Seeds, though sometimes pro- 
duced, are not always procurable. A certain 
and easy method of obtaining strong plants 
was, therefore, a desideratum. This is sup- 
plied by the following plan : — Place the bulb, 
when commencing its growth, near the bottom 
of a well-drained pot, and fill up with soil as 
the plant progresses, coiling the shoots three 
or four times round the inner side of the pot 
before they reach the top. The lower parts of 
the stems are thus for a considerable distance 
buried beneath the soil. Under this treat- 
ment, the plants grow vigorously, and, in the 
course of the season, several bulbs will be pro- 
duced along the buried portions of the stem. 

Colour for Garden Stakes. — This, 
though apparently a simple matter, deserves 
consideration. It is not unfrequent to see the 
sticks and stakes necessarily used to support 
the plants painted either a bright green or a 
light green, or sometimes even white. Now 
nothing can be worse than to employ bright 
and glaring colours ; by contrast, under such 
circumstances, the foliage of most plants is 
seen to disadvantage, being rendered dull and 
uninteresting by the proximity of brighter 
tints. The most invisible colour that can be 
chosen is undoubtedly the best ; and, perhaps, 
there is nothing that answers this description 
better— or even so well — as a dull olive-green. 
These remarks apply to all sorts of trellis- 



work intended for plants, as well as to sticks 
and stakes. Even the material used for tying 
would be the better for being steeped in a 
similar colour. 

Propagating Plnks. — Those who require 
to propagate Pinks extensively for the flower- 
borders will find that the plan propounded 
some years ago, by Mr. Mearns, is more 
speedily performed, and is attended with as 
great success, as the wearisome and tedious 
mode of propagating by pipings. In applying 
it proceed as follows : — Choose a shady and 
moist situation, dig the ground, making it 
smooth and fine, at the same time adding some 
sand ; (his is all the preparation necessary. 
Take off the slips by pulling them downwards; 
do not dress them in any way, neither smoothen 
the rough end, nor shorten the grass ; lay the 
slip horizontally on the surface of the ground, 
press the base into the soil in a doubled form 
with one hand, and set the top end upright 
with the other ; let them be well watered, and 
the operation is completed. No shading is 
required. 

New Grape. — Mr. Ingram, her Majesty's 
gardener at Windsor, has succeeded in raising 
a seedling grape of considerable merit. "We 
are not aware that any name has yet been 
given to it. It was raised from the Muscat 
[of Alexandria ?], impregnated by the variety 
called West's St. Peter's. The fruit is black, 
of a round form, with a thickish skin, sweet 
flavour, and about as fleshy as the Muscat. 
It is likely to prove a useful variety for late 
hothouse culture. 

Stands for Stanhopeas. — It is usual to 
plant Stanhopeas in wire baskets, and to sus- 
pend them from the roof of the orchidaceous 
house : this is necessary, as the natural habit 
of these plants is to push their flower spikes 
downwards among their roots. This plan is 
inconvenient when it is necessary to remove 
the plants from one place to another. The 
following is a preferable method : — Select a 
portion of the trunk of a tree, six or ten inches 
in diameter, and of any form that may be 
preferred — that is, either simple or forked ; 
cut the lower end horizontally, to form a base; 
the other end — or ends, if forked — is made 
bluntly conical, and upon the extremity of this 
cone the plant is fastened, just in the usual 
way of fixing these plants to blocks of wood : 
in due time the roots, embracing the trunk, 
fix the plants securely ; and, the flower-stems 
meeting with no obstruction, are borne in their 
natural position, pushing through the mass of 
roots and the moss which surrounds them. 
These stands, of course, admit of the removal 
of the plants from place to place without any 
difficulty. They may, moreover, be made of 
any size or height required. 

New Strawberry. — Mr. Myatt, of Dept- 



SEEDLING FRUIT, AND OTHER HARD-WOODED TREES. 



43 



ford, well known as one of the most success- 
ful raisers of strawberries, has this season 
exhibited one which he considers distinct, and 
has named Eleanor. It appears to be very- 
prolific, and is a handsome looking fruit. In 
form, it is bluntly conical ; in size, rather 
large ; in colour, light red, scarcely so delicate 
as the British Queen. The flavour is brisk, 
but somewhat acid, perhaps hardly so rich as 
some others. 

Aphides on Vegetable Crops, to de- 
stroy. — The Aphides, or plant-lice, do much 
injury to vegetables when they attack them, 
and are suffered to get the upper hand. To 
remove them, dredge the plants well early in 
the morning, while wet with dew, with dry 
wood ashes, charred wood, or sawdust, or 
chimney soot, either of which will be distaste- 
ful to the vermin ; the three together, how- 
ever, have a most beneficial effect, not only in 
clearing away the nuisance, but also in adding 
to the fertility of the soil. 

Cabbage-root Maggot. — The maggot 
which infests the roots of the cabbage, and 
other crops of the Brassica tribe, such as 
bi'ocoli, cauliflower, kales, &c, and which, if 
left undisturbed, often destroys whole crops, 
may be dislodged by applying a liquid prepa- 
ration formed by mixing wood-ashes and 
chimney- soot with water. A peck or more of 
soot and ashes may be mixed well in a hogs- 
head of water ; the ingredients should be well 
mixed, and then allowed to settle, and the 
clear liquor used. A good soaking application 
is necessary. 

SEEDLING FRUIT, AND OTHER HARD- 
WOODED TREES. 

Many are deterred, by the long period that 
elapses between the sowing and coming to 
maturity, from attempting to raise subjects 
that would, nevertheless, well repay them for 
the trouble ; but still the usual period required 
may be shortened by means that are easily 
applied. An apple-pip will be some years 
before it grows to a bearing tree. The apri- 
cot, peach, nectarine, cherry, pear, and other 
fruits, are, perhaps from the discouraging 
period of growth before bearing, all neglected 
alike ; but say that seven years is the shortest 
period that maturity and fruit-bearing can be 
hoped for under ordinary circumstances, and 
that then ninety-nine of every hundred are 
worse than the parent, it is enough to dis- 
courage any but an enthusiast to attempt 
growing seedling fruit-trees. Let us set some 
young gentleman or lady a task, not an un- 
pleasantvone if there be ground at command. 
Get the finest specimens of fruit that can 
be had; or rather, as you come across any 
fruit remarkably fine, save the seed. If it be 



cherries, save the stones ; apples, the pips. 
No matter what it be — if a wonderful fine 
strawberry, peel off the outside, with all the 
seeds on it, and save it in a bit of paper; the 
rest is not the worse for eating for losing its 
skin and seeds ; wash out the seeds from the 
pulp as soon as you get home, and put the 
seed on blotting-paper to dry. Raspberry, 
gooseberry, or currant, ditto ; in short, 
no matter what fruit it be, if the speci- 
mens are remarkably fine, save the seeds. 
Gooseberry, raspberry, and currant (the latter, 
perhaps, is not worth the trouble), must be 
saved whole, and the seeds be obtained by 
squeezing the berry and washing out the juice 
and pulp, as directed for strawberries; place 
them on blotting-paper to absorb the wet, and 
when thoroughly dried put them in paper. 
If nothing remarkably fine comes in your 
way, seek them. Contrive to procure the 
finest apple, pear, plum, nectarine, peach, 
apricot, cherries, gooseberries, raspberries, and 
other fruit ; a dozen apple-pips ; as many 
pear-pips ; cherry-stones and other stone fruit, 
half-a-dozen or a dozen each; and thus pro- 
vided, get a small patch of good strong 
ground, plant in all the stones two inches 
apart, in rows six inches apart, and mark the 
ends of the rows, because it will enable you 
to clear away weeds between the rows with- 
out disturbing the seeds. The strawberry, 
gooseberry, and raspberry seeds must be 
sown as you would sow annuals ; and as these 
seeds are to stand all the winter's rough wea- 
ther, and the risk of being disturbed by 
vermin, place over the whole, cuttings of 
gooseberry-bushes, branches of thorn, holly, 
or other prickly subjects, not enough to 
exclude the light, but enough to prevent the 
intrusion of cats, fowls, &c. In the spring, 
some of these subjects will come up, and 
others will lay some time in the ground ; but 
weeds must be cleared off as fast as they come 
up, and it can only be done safely by hand, 
for the hoe or spud may disturb the seeds and 
young plants. Let them be watered regularly 
all the summer, whether up or not, and con- 
tinue to keep clear of weeds. If the straw- 
berries, raspberries, and gooseberries are too 
thick, they may be carefully thinned, and the 
plants taken away and replanted in good, rich, 
strong ground, three inches apart every way, 
and that is about the distance to leave those 
in the seed bed. The time to thin these must 
therefore be when the plants are large enough 
to handle well, and this will get us fairly 
through the first season. It must be borne 
in mind that, when seeds are in the ground, 
they would be greatly risked if the soil in 
which they are placed were to be allowed to 
get dry, so as to evaporate any of the ab- 
sorbed moisture from the seeds; therefore on 



44 



THE AZALEA INDICA. 



no account should watering in dry weather 
ever be neglected. Our next year's proceed- 
ings will be the subject of a second lesson ; 
and in the mean time, secure seeds of anything 
very fine of the fruits that are from time to 
time laid before you. 

THE AZALEA INDICA. 

Much of the beauty of the Chinese gar- 
dens, in the early part of the floral season, is 
dependent on the numerous beautiful varieties 
of what are commonly called the Indian Aza- 
leas, which they possess ; and about the 
beginning of May, our own greenhouses and 
conservatories, as well as exhibition-rooms, 
bear ample testimony to their magnificence. 
A few years ago our gardens could boast of 
but few varieties of this particular plant : the 
old white ; phcenicea, a purple ; the double 
purple, with pale, almost lilac, fiowers ; and 
ODe or two others, were all that were in culti- 
vation. Latterly, however, a numerous race 
of hybrids has sprung up, and we now possess 
varieties of very varied tints of colouring, as 
well as of a highly-improved form. The 
mission to China of the botanical collector 
of the Horticultural Society has added several 
new forms to this particular group of Azaleas; 
but while these in some degree extend the 
variety among these flowers, we already pos- 
sess kinds of greater excellence, considered 
individually, than those which the Chinese 
gardens have afforded. 

But much more might be, and no doubt 
will be, effected towards their improvement. 
There are very few varieties even yet of 
really good properties, and we may look ere 
long to see their characteristics united with 
other colours. The best varieties, as regards 
form, are the following: — lateritia, brick-red; 
G'edstanesii, white, usually slightly streaked 
with red, sometimes with flowers all white or 
all red, occasionally half red, half white ; vari- 
egata, delicate flesh colour, with a paler 
margin. In these varieties the segments of 
the corolla are broad, so as to form a close, 
round, flattish, funnel-shaped flower. The 
brightest coloured kinds we have are : — the 
Chinese A. obtusa, recently introduced, which 
is of a rich brilliant crimson ; and an English 
variety, called refulgens, with much larger 
flowers, of a similar or even brighter colour. 
In the absence of a pure white of perfect 
form, the old ledifolia (indica alba, as it is 
sometimes called), or some of the larger va- 
rieties, may be chosen. Neither is there yet 
any perfect forms of the deep purple colour 
of phoenicea ; the variety Triumphant is of a 
kind of rosy purple, but much lighter than 
phoenicea. 

The culture of the Indian Azalea is not 



difficult, if one or two points are attended to. 
They do best in soil composed chiefly, if not 
entirely, of peat earth, in a rough turfy state, 
and mixed with sand in proportion to its 
degree of porosity. That kind of peat soil is 
the most proper for them which is of a light 
fibrous texture, and contains naturally a good 
proportion of clean sharp sand ; this should 
be collected in the form of turves of three or 
four inches in thickness ; and when used 
should be well broken clown by the spade and 
hand, but not sifted, to remove the fibrous 
portions. For the strongest growing kinds, 
a slight mixture of loam is desirable, in the. 
proportion of about one part in six or eight ; 
a nice free mellow loam is the most proper to 
be employed. They require plenty of pot- 
room, and the pots must be efficiently drained, 
as they require to be liberally supplied with 
water, both when flowering and when growing. 
The best time to repot them is just after they 
have done blooming, which will generally be 
from the beginning of April to the middle of 
May. Plants which have bloomed veiy early, 
from having been forced, may be potted when 
about in the same state. By potting at this 
period the growth of the roots is excited, and 
they form themselves before and during the 
time of the growth of the shoots. When 
young plants are to be grown on into speci- 
mens, they may be prevented from blooming, 
and then potted and started into growth some- 
what earlier, that is, during the month of 
March. Just previous to shifting they should 
be put into a house where they will be sub- 
jected to a moist genial atmosphere, and a 
temperature of from 50 to 55 degrees. While 
growing they require plenty of air and light, 
but not an excess of either ; thus, for example, 
draughts of cold air must be avoided, as they 
are highly injurious; and very strong sunshine 
during the middle of the day should be kept 
from them by a slight shading, until the 
young shoots get pretty well matured, when 
they may have the full sun. Small plants 
intended to be formed into specimens, should 
not be allowed to flower for a year or two ; 
or, at least, a more perfectly formed plant 
may be obtained by this arrangement. To 
effect this, the plants must be kept moderately 
dry in a cool greenhouse, for the winter ; and 
then in the following spring submitted to a 
similar course of treatment. If it is desired 
to grow them on very rapidly, they may be 
potted again about July, when the first growth 
has been pretty well matured, having been 
first subjected to coolness and moderate dry- 
ness, and then placed in a warmer damp 
atmosphere, to excite a second growth. When 
this is attempted, the second growth should 
be completed early, so as to admit of being 
well ripened before winter. If it is not

thought desirable to push the growth of the 
plants so rapidly, they may be set out of 
doors about the end of July, into a place where 
they will be sheltered from strong winds, and 
exposed to the sun ; the pots being plunged 
in moss, sawdust, or ashes, or otherwise pro- 
tected from the drying influences of the sun 
and air. Throughout the growing season they 
require to be regularly supplied with water, 
but not over watered ; in the winter, on the 
other hand, they must be kept somewhat dry, 
but not excessively so, or their leaves will fall 
off. In winter they may always be kept in a 
cool greenhouse, in which just warmth enough 
to exclude frosts is maintained. Older bloom- 
ing plants, after they have done flowering, 
must have all the old flower-stalks removed, 
except where seed is required, and then they 
must be repotted and set to grow, and treated 
in the same manner as the other plants. 

The Indian Azaleas are excellent plants for 
accelerating into early bloom for the decoration 
of the conservatory dui'ing the early spring. 
For this purpose, early and well-ripened wood 
must be secured ; this must be effected by 
exciting the plants into growth early in the 
spring previous, so that their growth may be 
completed by the middle or end of August, 
when they are to be exposed to a sunny situa- 
tion out-doors to ripen their wood. Early in 
the autumn they must be set in the green- 
house, before they are at all injured by 
frost. By the beginning of November some 
of the plants which have their flower-buds in 
a forward state, may be removed to a warm 
and light part of a stove or flower forcing- 
house, where they will be subjected to a tem- 
perature varying between sixty and seventy 
degrees by day, and eight or ten degrees 
lower by night ; if they can be accommodated 
with from seventy- five to eighty degrees of 
bottom heat, so much the better. A week or 
two before these plants are ready to expand 
their blossoms, others should be introduced ; 
in doing which those plants should be selected 
which, from the enlargement of their buds, 
are evidently in a state susceptible of excite- 
ment. It is a good plan, where the early 
blooming of these plants is an object, to raise 
a stock of some of the most distinct colours, 
and grow them for this purpose, reserving the 
finer specimen plants for blooming at the 
natural season. 

The Azalea may be propagated by cuttings 
of the young shoots, taken off when they are 
about two inches long and scarcely half 
ripened ; they must be planted in sand, and 
placed in the influence of a gentle bottom heat. 
They may also be rooted from layers, but 
these do not form such handsome plants. The 
finer and more delicate varieties flourish best 
when grafted or inarched on stocks of the 



stronger and freer-growing kinds, or even on 
healthy, kindly-growing stocks of the common 
Rhododendron. 

The Azaleas ripen their seeds early in 
spring — that is, in February or March, about 
which period they should be sown. Being 
very minute, they require somewhat careful 
management to ensure success. The pots 
must be half filled with materials for drainage, 
and the peat earth employed must be mixed 
with at least a third part silver sand ; with 
this the pots are to be filled to within half an 
inch of the top, the soil being pressed down 
evenly and firmly. The seed is then to be 
sown very thinly, and just covered by a dust- 
ing of very sandy peat, or even pure sand, 
forming as thin a coating as will suffice to just 
cover the seeds. The pots are to be set on a 
shelf in the greenhouse, and are to be thus 
shaded until the seeds begin to germinate : — lay 
a piece of glass over the top of the pot, and on 
this glass a layer of moss kept constantly damp. 
When the plants begin to spring up, the moss 
may be reduced in quantity, and shortly dis- 
pensed with altogether, and the glass likewise 
in a short time afterwards. The seedlings are 
to be pricked out into other pots, in sandy 
peat soil, as soon as they can be conveniently 
handled ; and subsequently are to be potted 
separately into small pots, and treated as other 
young plants. 

HORTICULTURAL LITERATURE. 

Hamilton on the Pine, Vine, and Cu- 
cumber. — Without going to the length of as- 
serting that Mr. Hamilton is without an equal 
among the writers of modern times on particular 
branches of gardening, we may venture to set 
him down among the very few who have given 
us very useful lessons, and shown that they have 
something like original notions. The book is 
valuable on many accounts. In the first place, 
upon the subject of the pine-apple, we have a 
short abstract of all that has been written by 
the principal cultivators of this fruit, or rather 
of the leading points in their various practice, 
as a prelude to that recommended by the 
author — a practice since carried out with the 
greatest success by many gardeners, and 
worthy of attention by every grower for pri- 
vate families; for it is not quite the same with 
gentlemen's gardeners as with the growers for 
sale. The former wants to cut a pine the 
year round comparatively, while the latter has 
to drive them in at the season when they 
bring the most money at market. Mr. Hamil- 
ton's culture brings a sucker to fruit earlier 
and better than by any of the ordinary me- 
thods, and we have seen the system work well 
in several private gardens. By his method, 
the sucker is not taken from the plant at all,

THE ROSE AMATEUR S GUIDE. 



but is earthed up, and it shows the benefit of it 
in an early development of its fruit. With 
regard to the vine and cucumber, we have 
only to remark that the amateur will not be 
deterred from attempting their culture by any 
real or pretended difficulties. The author can 
be understood by a novice, and we may add 
that there is no waste of words. There are 
few works on gardening, or any of its branches, 
that have the same merit of conciseness in so 
great a degree as the author's little volume. 
A second edition has been published, with ad- 
ditional information. 

Every Lady her own Gardener. — Let 
not any one who has read the work of 
Abercrombie — " Every Man his own Gar- 
dener," fancy for a moment that the little book 
before us is like it. There is nothing to j us- 
tify the title, or tempt any one to buy. 
"Every Lady her own Gardener" is the off- 
spring of some feminine pen, which betrays all 
the weakness of the sex, and we had nearly said 
the vanity of inexperience and self-sufficiency. 
There is nothing new in it — not an idea but 
what has been worn to tatters in all the works 
from Miller's downwards ; and it merely adds 
one to the hundreds of volumes that might 
be burned with great advantage. We do not 
wish to be severe where there is a shadow of 
originality or other value, but it is high time 
that a line were drawn between works of mere 
compilation and works of merit. Nothing 
but a novel and successful mode of treatment 
justifies any one in thrusting a work on 
the public, and adding to the multitudes of 
trashy "Guides," "Treatises," "Observa- 
tions," " Remarks," " Instructions," and 
" Pamphlets," that surfeit even the patient 
reader of garden literature, as it is called. The 
little volume before us may be said, nay has 
been said, to be unpretending. This, how- 
ever, merely amounts to the fact that the 
authoress does not presume, like another lady, 
to find fault with the very works she copies, 
as an excuse for giving us a worse. Still 
there was no occasion for it. There are plenty 
of books that would teach ladies gardening far 
better than this. In short, the abridgment of 
the History of England into a child's book 
would give as much notion of the subject as 
" Every Lady her own Gardener " will of 
horticulture. There are little works of a 
fourth of the price that contain four times as 
much useful matter, and, moreover, written 
by persons that write for the multitude who 
have but scanty knowledge, instead of spinning 
a subject into fine rounded periods of no 
meaning, and garnishing it with words in- 
comprehensible to the million. We are the 
last to decry female talent, or to undervalue 
the efforts of a lady if the least useful, but 
there is a double blunder in this work. Had 



it been written down a little more, and the 
title been " The Child's Guide to Gardening," 
we should have said nothing about it ; but, 
with no pretensions to originality or novelty, 
to assume the title of the best work of the 
kind, and lead to a supposition that it 
was worthy of the same rank among females 
that Abererombie's book was among men, was 
to thrust it into notice under a flag which it 
dishonoured. 

The Gooseberry Register. — This in- 
teresting little hand-book or guide to the 
gooseberry-grower is but partially known 
among the generality of gardeners, whether 
professional or amateur, but it ought to be in 
the hands of everybody who cultivates that 
favourite fruit. It is a complete register of the 
principal shows, with the names, weight, and 
colours of the winning berries, and is conse- 
quently one of the best possible instructors to all 
who intend purchasing the largest and best show 
varieties. It would appear, in a general way, 
that the heaviest berries win ; that they are 
classed in four colours, red, white, green, and 
yellow, each competing together, and not one 
against the other. There are also notices of 
the new varieties to come out, and of shows 
appointed next year. Of course, the reports 
are, to those not in the fancy, very uninterest- 
ing; but there is a summary of each variety's 
winnings, and the weight of the heaviest that 
have been shown during the season. This 
summary is of far greater interest than the 
rest, and is worth the attention of any body 
who has room to grow a few of the most suc- 
cessful kinds. 

The Rose Amateur's Guide. — The only 
fault we find with this little volume is, 
that it is calculated, if not written, to 
induce persons to buy a few good roses 
that will please them, and a great many that 
are worthless ; the common fault, and, we 
much fear, the too common object, of guides 
written by or for dealers. It contains some 
very good hints as to the general culture of 
the rose, and a sort of classification of the dif- 
ferent families, which, however, is becoming 
less useful every season, inasmuch as the 
family distinctions are rapidly fading away, 
and the rose-growers themselves, in many 
cases, do not know with which family to class 
some of the new varieties. By- and -by we 
shall have something more rational than the 
present classification, and roses will be dis- 
tinguished by their striking peculiarities in- 
stead of their real or supposed parentage. 
The moss, the China, noisette, climbing, and 
summer or June roses, are plain enough, but 
whether a rose is a hybrid China, a Gallica, 
or a Provence, is of mch importance (!) 
that doctors differ as to which a new one 
belongs to. 



THE MUCK MANUAL. 



47 



The Gardener's Monthly Volume. — 
The Dahlia. — This is one of those laboured 
productions which are made out of older and 
better works. "Whatever quackery assumes a 
new form goes down for its time; and it is not 
to be denied that the number of short-sighted, 
weak-minded people, who, like children, are 
" pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw," so 
far outnumber those of common sense, that the 
folly and worthlessness of a thing are no bar 
to success. There is not one useful hint in 
this long rigmarole that has not been pub- 
lished before in a much better and more un- 
derstandable form. This is a good deal to 
say, but we do not venture facts without 
proofs being at hand. Years ago, all that was 
useful in the culture of the Dahlia was pub- 
lished in one moderate Treatise, without a 
waste sentence or a useless engraving. The 
twisting about of words and paragraphs, and 
going into elaborate details about trifles, are 
worthy of bookmakers by profession ; but we 
should like to know whether, when men ad- 
dicted to this kind of business reflect a little, 
they think it a creditable employment ? 
Among the books which we propose describ- 
ing and noticing, we find a series of the works 
before us, and most of them have the name of 
some grower, who thus consents to publish his 
own inability by putting on the leading-strings 
of Mr. Johnson, who is supposed to put the 
words into English for him ; or, which is 
worse, makes known his willingness to sell the 
use of his name to a mere compilation from 
other men's works. The Dahlia affair is 
ushered into the world by the aid of Mr. Tur- 
ner, a very successful grower, by whom the 
Editor professes to be assisted ; and we are 
sorry to see so good a florist deceived as he 
must have been, to be drawn into the discre- 
ditable employment of a compiler's drudge. 
We, however, acquit Mr. Turner of any wilful 
plagiarism. We believe he has been applied 
to for his name, and that he may have read 
the work, to see if there were any thing im- 
proper in the directions ; and that, seeing 
there was nothing to condemn in the practice, 
he considered his duty done. We will never 
believe, until we are compelled, that he would 
compile, and garble, and change the language 
of known sound writers, to pass off the same 
ideas, information, and instructions as his 
own. We consider such compilations so many 
public nuisances, mere licensed petty larcenies, 
and are sorry when we see a respectable name 
put down as the Editor's tool for such very 
discreditable work. 

Roberts's Culture of the Vine under 
Glass. — The principal u^e of this treatise, was 
to give us the general notion of what others 
recommended, and then Mr. Roberts's expe- 
rience and practice ; and in this he has done 



some service. The greater part of his matter 
was given in an early volume of the Gar- 
dener's Gazette, and it is more than probable 
that to the reception it met with there, may 
be attributed the publication of this little 
volume. The principal fault we find with it 
is, the great unnecessary trouble imposed on 
the cultivator, from the formation of the 
border up to the thinning of the grapes. 
There is too much fussy detail to be useful, 
and it is a question whether the supposition 
that all Mr. Roberts recommends is necessary, 
would not debar many from attempting the 
culture, or induce a carelessness that would 
be nearly as fatal. Many who would gladly 
undertake the culture of grapes, if no more 
than the necessary trouble were recommended, 
would give it up in hopeless despair, if they 
could once be seriously impressed with the 
notion that Mr. Roberts's tedious and laborious 
tasks had really to be performed. Neverthe- 
less, we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that 
there is a good deal of theory mixed up with 
the practice — abundance of speculation going 
down the stream with the sound part of the 
advice. We are always against increasing 
the apparent difficulties of science ; men do 
the most service who simplify all operations. 
By the plain teacher who goes about anything 
the easiest way, a novice is induced to begin 
that, which would be a frightful task if laid 
down after Mr. Roberts's fashion. The author 
says too much, he passes a sentence of con- 
demnation on his own work ; he says, " in it 
will be found plain language and plain prac- 
tice, (pirated from no one,) in which I have 
had great success." Now, considering that 
many of the best growers that have attempted 
vine culture, had practised and written before 
him, he was merely recommending his plan 
against the many who had been known to 
excel, or he was improperly claiming origi- 
nality. There is, however, something to be 
gleaned from the book, which we are bound to 
say is not so original in the ideas as in the 
language. 

The Muck Manual. — This exceedingly 
useful volume has furnished the contributors 
to farming newspapers with ample food for their 
hungry pens and ambitious notions. Those 
who will take the pains to read the work care- 
fully, will find an immense store of really use- 
ful information to the farmer, and he will re- 
cognise the original facts and lessons upon 
which the Farmer's Gazettes, Journals, and 
Magazines, all over the country, have founded 
most of those papers that have sustained their 
otherwise empty title to support. There is 
scarcely a new fact to be sifted from works pub- 
lished since the Muck Manual appeared, at 
least upon those subjects which the volume 
professes to contain ; and probably upon the 



48 



DAPHNE FORTUNI. 



subjects of farm-yard, farm dressing, and the 
matters immediately relating thereto, there 
cannot be found in the same compass so much 
useful information to the farmer. We were 
well satisfied with the portion which may be 
called the book ; but the appendix is (like a 
lady's postcript, which is more important than 
the letter,) more valuable if possible than the 
work, yet it seems merely a classification of 
the matter. It bears upon the same subject ; 
it illustrates the opinions ; it is a collection 
of great facts which convince the reader that 
the chapters he has read contain good infor- 
mation, and sound reasoning. We have pro- 
fitted by the lessons we have learned from 
the Muck Manual, — the information about 
guano as well as all other sorts of dressing for 
farms and gardens. The appendix contains 
trials and results of various experiments, some 
very conclusive, others deficient of positive 
evidence ; but the whole are highly useful, 
and will be found particularly so by those who 
have been puzzled by the empty scribbling of 
people who want to palm off what they read 
in works of this kind for their own. 

Glenny's Properties of Flowers and 
Plants. — This volume contains all the pro- 
perties of flowers that Mr. Glenny has ever 
written. It comprises a very plain description 
of all those qualities and appearances which 
constitute the perfection of flowers and plants; 
and by a reference to which, any lady or gen- 
tleman, however little acquainted with flowers, 
may always select the best from any number 
or variety. No person should ever buy a 
plant without consulting this work. 

DAPHNE FORTUNI. 

Daphne Fortuni, Lindley (Mr. Fortune's 
Daphne). — Thyrnelaceas. — This plant is one 
of the recent acquisitions from China. It is 
a small shrub of great beauty, and in the 
garden of the Horticultural Society, at Chis- 
wick, has proved itself to be perfectly hardy, 
having stood in the open border during the 
winter of 1846-7, and retained its shoots per- 
fectly uninjured to the very points. On the 
Chekiang hills, where Mr. Fortune met with 
it, Fahrenheit's thermometer often sinks to 
within a few degrees of zero, so that there 
need now be little apprehension of its being 
injured in our climate, if placed under cir- 
cumstances in an ordinary degree favourable. 

It forms a small downy branched deciduous 
shrub, with thin opposite and alternate ovate- 
oblong and oblong leaves, covered with very 
soft fine hairs. The flowers are arranged in 
clusters of four upon the branches, when 
scarcely beginning to put forth their leaves ; 
they have a slender tube more than an inch 
long, covered externally with soft closely 



pressed hairs, and divided at the border into 
four roundish oblong obtuse uneven lobes, of 
which the two inner ones are the smallest ; 
their colour is a pale bluish-lilac, and they are 
produced in the early spring. 

We cannot discover any evidence whether 
or not this species bears fragrant flowers, 
though, from the circumstance of its near 
ally, D. Mezereum, being remarkably sweet 
scented, and most of the other kinds more or 
less so, it is probable that this kind also lias 
sweet-scented blossoms. Some of the green- 
house daphnes possess the fragrant property 
in a remarkable degree ; and it is also shared 
abundantly by several of the hardy species. 

Mr. Fortune states, that he first met with 
it in a nursery garden near Shanghae, in the 
winter of 1843. He goes on to say : " When 
I returned to the northern provinces, in the 
spring of the following year, I found it wild on 
many of the hills in the province of Chekiang. 
It here forms a dwarf deciduous shrub two or 
three feet high. Like the English mezereum 
it is the harbinger of spring. In March and 
April the flower buds expand, and then the 
whole of the hill sides are tinged with its 
beautiful lilac coloured blossoms, and have a 
very gay appearance. Before they fade, the 
azaleas, as if in floral rivalry, burst into bloom, 
and give those northern Chinese hills a de- 
scription of beauty peculiar to themselves. 
Its Chinese name is Nu-la7i-ee. Like the 
mezereum of this country, its bark is ex- 
tremely acrid and poisonous, and is used by 
the natives to produce blisters on the skin, 
particularly in cases of rheumatism." 

It is found to be very easily cultivated. It 
grows with ordinary care, if potted or planted 
in a loamy well-drained soil ; and may he 
propagated readily by means of cuttings, or 
by grafting on other deciduous hardy kinds of 
daphne. The main points to be observed in 
its cultivation are, to secure it a well-drained 
soil, to expose it fully to the sun when form- 
ing and ripening its wood during the summer 
months, and to give it a period of rest during 
winter when the leaves have fallen : this course 
of treatment will, under ordinary circum- 
stances, result in producing a fine display of 
bloom in the spring. If, however, while the 
same course of treatment is observed, the 
resting state is induced in the autumn, or early 
in winter, the blossoms may be readily enough 
excited to develope themselves, by the aid of 
artificial heat, at any period of the winter. 
There can be no doubt of its forming a most 
desirable plant for forcing into early bloom, 
and as such it will be valuable to those who 
practise the forcing of flowers. 

The Daphnes belong to the natural order 
Thymelacea? ; and in the Linncean system 
rank under Octandria Monogynia. 



FORMATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOWER GARDENS.

FORMATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOWER GARDENS. 



Bv a flower garden, as distinguished from 
what is called pleasure ground, is undei'stood 
a detached spot, occupied entirely by beds of 
flowers, intersected by gravel walks, or walks 
formed of turf, kept closely cut, and some- 
times a mixture of the two. The latter plan 
is preferable when it can be accomplished, 
because most available for all seasons. 

Flower Gardens of this class, usually are, 
or should be entirely detached from other 
scenery, by hedges, plantations of dwarf shrubs, 
or other appropriate living fences. They 
therefore should consist of three parts : — the 
boundary fence, the walks, and the flower 
beds. 

General Preparation. — In regard to the 
general preparation of the ground, the flower 
garden requires the same kind of attention as 
any other department. Thorough drainage is 
essential as a preliminary : next the ameliora- 
48. 



tion or improvement of the staple of the soil, 
assimilating it as nearly as possible with what 
are called free sandy loams ; and then the 
disposal of the surface into beds of various 
forms suitable for the intended purpose, each 
of which should appear appropriate and pleas- 
ing in itself, and still more so, as forming 
part of the whole. The series of beds form- 
ing a flower garden of this kind, should 
always form a regular and connected design, 
and above every other consideration, they 
should not be crowded too near each other. 

The surface of a flower garden may often 
be varied with good effect : thus, instead of 
being level, it may form a slope, or a series of 
steps or terraces ; or, if large enough, the 
ground may all slope towards the centre, by 
which the whole of the beds can be better 
seen than under any other arrangement. 

Laying out. — It is necessary to provide 

E 



r>o 



FORMATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOWER GARDENS. 



a working plan upon which the form of the 
beds should be indicated to scale by some per- 
son competent to judge of their effect, when 
transferred from the paper to the ground, as 
it frequently happens, that the designs which 
are most pleasing to the eye in the form of a 
drawing, are not so on the ground. Those de- 
signs, which, in practice, are found to give 
most satisfaction, and to be most suitable for 
gardening purposes, consist of pleasing com- 
binations of round, right angled, or blunt 
angled forms, arranged so as to appear com- 
plete as a design, without being crowded. 
Especially if on grass, this latter point should 
be considered, the effect and relief of broad 
spaces of green among the gayer masses of 
the flowers, being particularly effective ; and 
besides this, as the grass will have to be fre- 
quently mown, narrow, or confined strips of 
turf are excessively inconvenient: in fact, it is 
impossible to mow them properly without 
injuring the flowers. The space between the 
beds ought never to be less than three feet 
wide. The centre of the group may appro- 
priately be occupied by a fountain, a sculptured 
figure, a dial, or any object of a similar nature. 
It is as well if the design provides an equal 
width between the beds, throughout, but this 
is more essential in the case of gravel walks 
than when the beds are laid down upon grass. 
The design having been drawn on paper to 
a large scale, and marked all over with pa- 
rallel lines at right angles, at the scale of a 
yard apart, or wider if the beds are large and 
not intricate; corresponding parallel lines in- 
dicated by string, should be temporarily placed 
down on the ground, after it is made perfectly 
even on the surface. Both the plan and the 
ground will now be covered with little squares, 
the sides of which are a yard in length. The 
next step is, to measure with the compasses 
from (the angles chiefly, of) these lines on the 
plan, to the lines which indicate the outside 
of the different beds, and the compasses being 
applied to the scale, and the distances ascer- 
tained, the same lengths are to be measured 
on the ground with a light rod, and marked 
by means of light pegs of about two feet long. 
The same process has to be done in every 
direction, till the dimensions of each bed are 
sufficiently indicated to enable the operator to 
fill up the figure by the eye. The laying 
down of the design consists in thus going 
through the whole of the beds, and measuring 
the distance of their projection from the square 
guide lines, and marking it on the ground by 
means of the pegs. The lines must be identi- 
cal in their position, both on the paper and on 
the ground ; this is secured by starting from 
some fixed object which admits of being indi- 
cated with accuracy on the paper, and can be 
measured from in laying down the lines ; thus 



the straight line of a walk or of a building afford 
a good starting point or base line, and this 
being secured, it is only further necessary to 
make all those parallel to it quite true, and to 
take care that the cross lines are placed exactly 
at a right angle with the others. When the 
whole design is accurately indicated in this 
way on the ground, the lines may be removed, 
and the pegs be adjusted by the eye, so as to 
exactly represent the straight or curved lines 
they are intended to indicate, for this is rarely 
done with accuracy in first setting down the 
pegs, some getting put an inch on one side 
the true line, and some an inch on the other ; 
these irregularities are, however, easily recti- 
fied by the eye, but of course not more than 
one or two pegs should be taken up at a time, 
and these should be replaced before others 
are removed. 

Thus far, the proceedings would be the 
same, whether the garden was to be formed 
with gravel pathways, or laid down on grass ; 
but here the operations differ. If the beds 
are to be formed on a lawn already made, the 
next step will be to cut away the turf from 
the part which is to form the bed, not ap- 
proaching at first to within three or four inches 
of the marginal line. If the turf is required 
to be used elsewhere, it should be cut off 
evenly and carefully, in straight pieces of a 
foot wide and two or three feet long ; but if 
it is not required, it may be dug in, and will 
serve to improve the soil. After the digging 
up of the soil, the edges maybe cut accurately 
to the line marked ; but after this is done, great 
care must be taken that the edge is not trod- 
den down. The original surface will now 
form the pathways between the beds. As re- 
gards the soil, if the natural earth is of bad 
quality, it must be taken out and renewed two 
feet deep, with rich, sandy, loamy soil. The 
drainage, as already stated, must be made per- 
fect. If the soil is of good quality, it should 
be trenched two feet deep, and a portion of 
fresh soil added to give the bed a slightly 
rounded surface. If of medium quality, some 
of the worst, which is usually the lower part, 
should be taken out, and fresh soil added, and 
well mixed with what is left of the old soil. 
In either case, if this be done, manure will 
not be required : indeed, manure is danger- 
ous in a flower garden if inconsiderately ap- 
plied ; and therefore it is better to renew the 
soil from time to time as it gets exhausted, 
than to apply a great quantity of manure. 

When the pathways are intended to be of 
grass, and these, as well as the beds, have to 
be formed, the surface should first be made 
even, and the beds marked out as already ex- 
plained. Then the part which is intended to 
form the bed must be dug up, and the soil 
renewed, if necessary, as just explained. The 



FORMATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOWER GARDENS.

parts which are to form the pathways between 
the beds, are then to be covered with turf. 
This is done in the following manner ; — First, 
have the surface well worked over with the 
spade, and all the lumpy parts of the soil 
chopped to pieces and broken quite fine, and 
the whole made even in accordance with the 
natural level or inclination of the ground. If 
the soil is very dry, it should be well watered 
as the turves are laid down. They are to be 
laid down close together, and quite even, and 
two or three inches on each side wider than 
ultimately required. They are next to be 
beaten down firmly with what is called a turf- 
beater ; this is a heavy slab of wood with one 
smooth face, about a foot broad and two feet 
long, with a handle long enough to be used 
by a man standing upright, set diagonally into 
it at a proper angle, to fall perfectly level and 
flat upon the surface of the turf at each stroke ; 
with this, the turf is to be beaten down firmly 
and evenly. The soil in the beds is to be 
trenched up, and got into order ; and as a last 
operation, the edges of the turf are to be cut 
evenly to the line indicated by the pegs, and 
the soil then finally adjusted for the reception 
of the plants. 

When the flower garden is to consist en- 
tirely of beds and gravel walks, a somewhat 
different course is necessary. In this case, 
however, the preliminary operations are the 
same, an even surface being necessary to faci- 
litate the work, and the design or plan requir- 
ing to be marked out on the ground by the same 
process as in the other instances. But in this 
case, preparation must be made for planting 
round the beds, or to indicate the division 
between the walks by some distinct and per- 
manent edging, of which the most universal, 
the neatest, and the best of live edgings, is 
the dwarf variety of the box tree, known as 
Dutch box by gardeners, ( Buxus semper- 
virens suffruticosa, or nana.) The bos edg- 
ing is planted by making the soil firm, and 
quite even, and then cutting down a sloping 
bank, the top of which is to occupy the exact 
marginal line of the bed, and the bottom is to 
slope a little outward ; this may be six or 
eight inches deep, according to the length of 
the box to be planted against it ; the box is 
then set against this, a few inches at a time, 
thinly, and very evenly, both as regards thick- 
ness and placing the tops level, and is thus 
held by the back of the left hand, while, with 
the other, a sufficient portion of earth is drawn 
up to fix it firmly in this position : more earth 
is then added evenly with the spade, the whole 
is gently trodden up, and the walk formed by 
the addition, first of coarse stones or brick- 
bats, and then of coarse gravel with a layer 
of fine gravel on the surface, which is made 
nearly level with the box at the edges, and 



slightly rounded in the centre. The edgings 
are sometimes formed of dressed stone, of 
slate, or might now be made of glass ; but in 
either case they should be light, and about 
two or three inches high, and placed down, so 
as to indicate accurately the figures of the 
several beds 

This work of laying out, or disposing of the 
ground, may be done during any interval of 
fine weather in autumn, winter, or spring. 
Such work cannot be well done when the soil 
is at all adhesive from moisture, nor when the 
soil is frozen. In any open weather, during 
the period referred to, when the soil is com- 
paratively dry, it may be carried on. As the 
spring season is, however, very much occupied 
by operations of culture, it is usually most con- 
venient to get work of this kind forward dur- 
ing the autumn, or the early part of winter. 

Soil. — For the cultivation of flowers, the 
renewal of the soil to a certain extent annually 
is preferable to the use of manure. There 
are places where this can be done ; and, in 
such cases, the benefit will be apparent. It 
is done thus : — About a third of the bulk of 
soil provided for the plants, or say a depth of 
eight inches is removed entirely ; the same 
quantity of fresh loamy soil, of the same light 
texture as that at first employed, and procured 
from a common waste or pasture, is then re- 
turned in its stead ; this, and the remainder 
of the soil in the bed, is then well stirred and 
mixed together until it is thoroughly incor- 
porated, when it will be ready to receive the 
plants at the planting season. In gardens 
where this cannot be done, a portion of tho- 
roughly decomposed manure, (that of cows, if 
possible,) should be added annually, and 
mixed up with the soil in the same way, 
which, in either case, is to be laid up roughly 
in ridges to the action of frost during the 
winter. 

Of course, this system of managing the 
soil, can only be practised where the modern 
plan of filling the beds with half-hardy plants 
during summer is followed. Wherever the 
beds or borders are filled with permanent her- 
baceous plants, mixed with roses and similar 
shrubs, it will only be practicable to dig up 
the surface roughly between the plants, and 
let it lie in this state during winter. Some- 
times, even in the former case, the beds are 
filled up for the winter with dwarf evergreen 
shrubs in pots ; and for spring flowers, with 
various bulbs and other early blooming 
plants planted between them : when this is 
the case, there is little opportunity of expos- 
ing the soil to the action of the weather, with 
a view to its becoming sweetened and pulver- 
ized, and hence arises the necessity of substi- 
tuting fresh soil, which, in this case, should 
be done in autumn, before the spring bulbs 
e 2

are planted. When there is not the means of 
absolutely renewing the soil every year, if 
there is a spare corner where the soil can be 
laid, and frequently turned over in summer and 
winter, and enough can be procured to fill the 
beds twice, the same soil, after being so turned 
over, may be used on alternate years, and will 
thus last for several years, being sufficiently 
improved by the exposure to answer nearly 
every purpose which fresh soil would secure ; 
whilst the only expense would be the labour 
attending its being removed and replaced, and 
that involved in turning it at intervals during 
the whole year in which it would be unem- 
ployed. Unless something of this sort can be 
done, full success in the modern system of 
flower- gardening cannot be realized, for no 
application of manure of any kind will com- 
pensate for the freshness and aeration of the 
soil which is thus secured. 

The soil of a flower garden is very easily 
made too rich by the application of manures ; 
and when this is the case the plants grow rank 
and luxuriant, and generally do not bloom 
well. And thus it is that the application of 
manure to the old soil is never productive of 
such satisfactory results as the renewal of the 
soil. In cases where the latter is out of the 
question, it will be necessary to use some 
manure from time to time, perhaps annually. 
None, however, should be employed which is 
not thoroughly decomposed, and no kind is 
preferable to that of cows, or in place of this, 
the decayed manure employed for hot-beds. 
The artificial manures, such as guano, and 
the various saline manures, are too powerful, 
and though they may sometimes be used with 
advantage, yet they are dangerous in the 
hands of the uninitiated. Generally speaking, 
these latter are best applied in the form of 
liquid manure during the growing season. Of 
the decomposed manure, a sufficient dressing 
would be secured by a layer of four or six 
inches thick ; this should be evenly spread 
over the surface, and then the whole 
mass of soil, to the depth of eighteen inches, 
should be turned over, and the manure tho- 
roughly and carefully incorporated therewith. 
If the beds are filled during winter and spring, 
this should be done in the autumn, before the 
spring flowers are planted ; but if the beds 
are allowed to remain empty during the win- 
ter, as they may be in entirely detached gar- 
dens, though it may be done at the same time, 
yet the process will differ, inasmuch as it 
would then be desirable to lay the surface up 
in rough ridges, which would require to be 
forked down level in the spring when the beds 
were planted. 

General Management. — The management 
of a bed or border of miscellaneous plants is 
simple. At the time of planting, the dwarf 



kinds should be kept near the edges, while the 
taller ones are placed behind them, the tallest 
being quite at the back of all the rest. The 
first set of plants, growing six inches high, 
may be six inches from the margin, or one 
foot, if of a spreading or procumbent habit. 
Plants of a foot or so in height may be set a 
foot behind these, and alternating with them. 
Those growing two feet or so, should be 
eighteen inches behind these, and opposite the 
front ones, and so on to the back part of the 
border. The distance between the plants in 
the ranks should be about the same as from 
the other rows of plants, the object being to 
give each plant, according to its size, a fair 
proportion of space. Mixed borders of this 
kind generally get out of regular series in a 
short time ; when additions are made, it often 
happens that they are put in, in the most open 
pai'ts, without much regard to arrangement, 
and so that something like the proper position 
is thus secured to the plant, it is quite as well 
or better than planting them formally. In- 
deed, if any attempt is made to range them in 
the series, which, for the sake of illustration 
has been pointed out, formality must be 
strictly guarded against, the larger and more 
spreading plants being allowed more room 
than close upright compact growers. Such 
gardens as this, are usually furnished with 
a proportion of herbaceous perennials, which 
are, as it were, fixtures ; and the interme- 
diate spaces are filled out by a few bulbs in 
spring, by self sown or autumn sown annuals, 
or by half hardy annuals reared in frames in 
spring, or hardy ones sown at the proper time 
where they are intended to grow, by dahlias 
reared in heat in spring, and by the half- 
hardy greenhouse plants, which are more espe- 
cially brought into requisition by the modern 
grouping system. Besides planting, the at- 
tention required is mere routine ; — the plants 
must be supported as they require it, the de- 
caying flowers, leaves, and stems removed ; 
the annuals entirely cleared away when past 
flowering, and the tender plants taken up in 
autumn and dealt with according to their 
nature, either stored away or thrown away, 
as may be required in each case. Watering 
must be attended to in dry weather. The 
branches or flowers must be thinned if they 
become crowded ; the permanent plants taken 
up and reduced when they get too large ; and 
the vacancies in other cases filled up, as they 
occur, with such plants as may be available. 

The modern style of flower gardening, in 
which plants — usually of a better class — are 
grown in masses of larger or smaller extent, 
differs materially from the foregoing. In 
order to explain its nature, we must suppose 
the annexed diagram to represent a group of 
beds forming a parterre, or flower garden, 



FORMATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOWER GARDENS.

either on a lawn or on gravel, the manner of filling 
which with different classes of plants we will 
now proceed to detail. It may be proper to re- 
mark, that the selection of plants may be made 
very different according to taste; and in the case 
of a greater number of beds having to be filled, 



any appropriate additions might be made to 
the plants here named. This is a matter 
which may be almost infinitely varied as the 
fancy of the planter may dictate. The selec- 
tion here given is believed to be a very good 
one, but is certainly offered more for the pur- 




pose of illustrating the principle upon which 
such gardens are arranged and managed, than 
as furnishing an exact model for imitation. 

The centre of the design is supposed to be 
occupied by a fountain, a dial, a statue, a 
pedestal with vase, or any similar fixed ar- 
chitectural and ornamental feature : this is 
indicated by No. 1 . Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, are 
small beds, to be filled with dwarf plants of 
corresponding habits and varied colours. Nos. 
6, 7, 8, and 9, again, correspond in some de- 
gree in the planting. Then follow a series 
of oval beds, Nos. 10 to 17, which should also 
correspond in the style of plant selected. 
Nos. 18, 19, 20, and 21 are again cor- 
responding beds; and so are the smaller in- 
termediate ones, indicated by the Nos. 22, 
23, 24, and 25. All these groups of beds, 
while they must be filled by plants of varied 
colours, should each, as far as possible, con- 
tain plants of the same relative size and habit 
of growth. The selection now remains to be 
detailed. 

No. 2 is to be planted in October, for 
spring flowering, with crocuses (light blue 
variety) ; these should be set in patches of 
five or six roots pretty close together, the 



patches being about nine inches apart; they 
will come into flower in January and the 
early part of February. In March, patches 
of Collinsia grandiflora (purple and blue), 
sown in pots in autumn, and kept through 
the winter in frames, and well hardened, are 
to be planted between the patches of crocus, 
the leaves of which may be tied together in 
little knots; these, if sown early in autumn, 
will be considerably advanced, and will come 
into flower in April, and continue throughout 
May. In May (or earlier) the roots of the 
crocuses may be taken up, and laid in to 
ripen in a reserve garden, their place being 
now (in May) supplied by Gazania uniflora 
(lemon-coloured), raised from cuttings in Au- 
gust, and kept through the winter and spring 
in the greenhouse and frames ; these will 
come into flower in the course of June, and 
will last throughout the summer and autumn. 
No. 3 is to be planted in October with 
crocuses (dark blue variety), set in patches as 
in No. 2. Soon after the blooms of these 
are past, or early in March, Valerianella 
congesta (lilac) may be planted between them, 
having been well hardened previously; these 
are to be sown in pots in September, and 



54 



FORMATION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOWER GARDENS. 



kept in frames, and will be in flower pro- 
bably by the end of April, and last through- 
out May. The crocuses may be tied up, and 
taken up as in No. 2. In May, the bed is 
to be planted with Saponaria ocymoides 
(pink), a few rough pieces of stone being 
placed round each plant ; these should have 
been raised from cuttings in the latter part 
of the summer previously, and will soon be 
in flower, lasting a long time, probably 
throughout the months of June, July, and 
August. If the plants go out of flower by 
the middle of August, the beds may be tem- 
porarily filled by any small growing plant, of 
which a sufficient stock may be on hand. 

No. 4 is to be planted in October with 
crocuses (large yellow variety), managed as 
in No. 2. These are to be succeeded in 
March by Lasthenia glabrata (yellow), sown 
early in September in pots, and kept in a 
frame ; this will flower in April and May. 
In May the place of the crocuses is to be 
taken by plants of Tropceolum minus (orange), 
raised from seeds in February, in the green- 
house ; the shoots of this plant must be kept 
pegged down to the surface, and the leaves 
thinned a little; it also requires poor soil to 
flower freely, or what will serve the same 
purpose, a spade thrust into the soil all 
around, and rather near it, so as to cut some 
of the roots and thus check it ; this may be 
done two or three times, as seen to be neces- 
sary. It will probably commence flowering 
by the end of May, and last till October. 

No. 5 is to be planted in October with 
anemones (scarlet poppy-flowered), in patches 
at nine inches apart; these will flower in 
February and March. In the latter month, 
stocks (scarlet ten weeks) raised in pots in 
August, and kept in frames, should be planted 
between them; these will bloom in April and 
May. In May the anemones are to be re- 
moved to the reserve garden, and their place 
occupied by Nierembergia jilicaulis (white), 
raised from cuttings in August, and kept in 
a greenhouse in winter; this will bloom from 
June till the end of summer. 

No. 6 is to be planted in October with 
hyacinths (single blue variety — L'ami de 
Coeur), nine inches apart, the bed edged with 
a row of yellow pansies, raised from cuttings 
in August, and planted at the same time as 
the hyacinths. The pansies will bloom from 
February onwards; the hyacinths in April 
and May. In February the spaces between 
the hyacinths are to be planted with Nemo- 
phila insignis (blue), sown in pots early in 
September, and kept in cold frames ; this will 
most likely flower in March, and last through 
April into May. In May the hyacinths are 
to be taken up as soon as the bloom is past, 
«uid carefully laid in, in the reserve garden ; 



their place is then to be taken by Ageratum 
ccelestinum (pale blue), raised from cuttings 
in August, kept in frames during the winter, 
and now placed a foot apart : the edging of 
pansies may be removed and substituted by a 
bluish-lilac coloured variety of verbena (Ame- 
thystina) ; these plants will both bloom from 
June to October. 

No. 7 is to be planted in October, at nine 
inches apart, with tulips /'double yellow 
variety — Yellow rose), edged with dark purple 
coloured pansies, raised from cuttings in 
August, and planted in October. The pansies 
will come into bloom in February, and con- 
tinue onwards ; the tulips will bloom in May. 
Early in March, Yelloio lupines, sown in pots 
in August, and kept in frames, should be 
planted between the hyacinths ; these will 
bloom in April and May. Towards the end 
of May the place of the tulips may be taken 
by Scarlet pelargoniums (Frogmore variety, 
or Huntsman), raised in the previous summer, 
and kept in the greenhouses and frames ; 
these will flower from June to October. The 
bed may be edged with a row of a white 
variety of verbena (the Queen). 

No. 8 is to be planted in October, with 
hyacinths (single red variety — Paix d' Amiens) 
as in No. 6, edged with cream-coloured pan- 
sies, raised from cuttings in August, and 
planted in October. The pansies will be in 
flower from February onwards, and the hya- 
cinths in April and May. By the beginning of 
March the bed may be filled between the hya- 
cinths with stocks (scarlet ten weeks), raised in 
pots in August, and kept through the winter 
in frames ; these will bloom in April and May. 
In May, the hyacinths are to be removed as in 
No. 6, and substituted by Ageratum ccelesti- 
num (pale blue) raised from cuttings in Au- 
gust, and kept in frames during winter. The 
pansy edging may be substituted for one of 
an orange-scarlet variety of verbena (Kyle's 
Speciosa). Both will flower from June to 
October. 

No. 9 is to be planted in October, with 
hyacinths (single white variety — Grand Vain- 
queur), as in No. 6, edged with light lilac- 
blue pansies, raised from cuttings in August, 
and planted in October ; they will bloom as in 
No. 6 and 8. In February, the bed should 
be planted between the bulbs with Gilia trico- 
lor (lilac), sown in pots early in September, 
and kept in a cold frame ; this will, probably, 
come in by the end of March, and continue 
through April and part of May. In May the 
hyacinths are to be removed, and the bed 
planted with Scarlet pelargoniums (General 
Tom Thumb) placed a foot and a-half apart ; 
these should be raised from cuttings, the pre- 
vious summer, and kept in the greenhouse and 
frames through the winter. This bed may

be edged in place of the pansies, by a row of 
a pink-flowered variety of verbena (Beaute 
Supreme). Both will bloom from June to 
October. 

No. 10 is to be planted, as in No. 6, with 
hyacinths (double blue variety — Lord Wel- 
lington,) edged with yellow crocus, planted in 
October, in patches of four or five, the patches 
at six inches apart ; these will flower in Ja- 
nuary and February, and the hyacinths in 
April and May. In February the beds may 
be planted between the hyacinths, with Gilia 
achillcefolia (blue), sown in pots early in Sep- 
tember, and kept in frames in winter ; this 
will flower in April, May, and June. In May, 
when the hyacinths are removed, the beds are 
to be planted with Calceolaria rugosa (yellow), 
raised from cuttings in August, and kept in 
the greenhouse through the winter ; it will 
flower from June to October. 

No. 11 is to be planted in October with 
tulips (single yellow), as in No. 7, edged with 
purple crocus, planted as in No. 10 ; the crocus 
will bloom in January and February ; the 
tulips in May. In February the spaces be- 
tween the tulips is to be filled with Collinsia 
bicolor (white and lilac), sown in pots early in 
September, and kept in frames ; this will 
bloom in April, May, and June. In May the 
space occupied by the tulips is to be replaced 
by Cup/tea platycentra (scarlet), raised from 
cuttings in August, and kept through the 
winter in the greenhouse and frames; this 
will bloom from June till October. 

No. 12 is to be planted in October with 
Polyanthus Narcissus (white variety — Grand 
Monarque,) at nine inches apart ; the bed may 
be edged with light blue crocus, planted as in 
No. 10 ; the crocus will flower in January 
and February, the narcissus in May. In Fe- 
bruary this bed is to be planted with stocks 
(purple ten weeks), raised in pots in August, 
and kept in frames ; these will bloom in April 
and May. In May, the place of the narcissus 
which are taken up and placed in the reserve 
garden, is to be occupied by the old variety of 
Petunia, violacea (purple), raised from cuttings 
in August, and kept through winter in the 
greenhouse and frames ; this will bloom from 
June onwards to October. 

No. 13 is to be occupied by Tulips (Tourne- 
sol — double scarlet and yellow), planted as in 
No. 7, with an edging of yellow crocus ; the 
former flower in May, the latter in January 
and February. In February, the spaces be- 
tween the tulips to be occupied by Nemophila 
insignis (blue), raised in pots early in Septem- 
ber, and kept in winter in frames ; this will 
bloom in April and May. In May, the place 
of the tulips is to be taken by Lobelia raviosa 
(blue), sown in August, and kept in the green- 
house through the winter ; these will bloom 



in June and July, and may be succeeded by 
another crop, sown in February, to bloom 
later in the season. 

No. 14 is to be occupied by hyacinths 
(double red variety — Waterloo), plante! as in 
No. 6, edged with white crocus; the latter 
bloom in January and February, the former 
in April and May. In February, the bed is 
to be planted between the hyacinths, with 
Coreopsis Drummondii (orange yellow), sown 
early in September, in pots, and kept in a 
frame ; it will bloom in May and June. In 
May, the place of the hyacinths is to be taken 
by Calceolaria viscosissiuia (orange yellow), 
raised from cuttings, in August, and kept in 
the greenhouse and frames ; it will bloom 
from June to October. 

No. 15 is to be occupied by Fritillaria 
prcecox (white), planted nine inches apart, in 
October, and edged with light blue crocus, the 
latter blooming in January and February, the 
former in April and May. In February the 
spaces between them should be planted with 
Nemophila atomaria (white), sown early in 
September in pots, and kept in frames; this 
will bloom in April, May, and June. In May 
the fritillarias may be removed to the reserve 
garden, and their place occupied by Heliotro- 
pium peruvianum (lilac), raised in August 
from cuttings, and kept in the greenhouse in 
winter ; these will flower from June to Octo- 
ber. 

No. 1 6 is to be occupied by Polyanthus Nar- 
cissus (yellow variety — Soleil d'Or), planted 
as in No. 12, and edged with light striped 
crocus, which flowers in January and Febru- 
ary, the narcissus in May. In February this 
is to be occupied with Godetia rosea-alba 
(pink), sown in August, to flower in May and 
June, followed in May by Silene pendula 
(rose-pink), taking the place of the narcissus, 
and blooming from June till September, the 
silene is to be sown in pots, at the end of 
September, and kept very airy in a cold 
frame. 

No. 17 is to be occupied by tulips (double 
red variety — Rex Rubrorum) planted as in 
No. 7, and edged with white crocus, the latter 
blooming in January and February, the for- 
mer in May. In February it is to be planted 
between with stocks (white ten weeks) sown 
in pots in August and kept in frames ; these 
will bloom in April and May. In May, the 
place of the tulips is to be taken by Agath&a 
coelestis (pale blue), raised from cuttings in 
August, and kept in the greenhouse and 
frame ; this blooms from June to October. 

No. 18 is to be planted in October with 
patches of ranunculus (Scarlet turban), nine 
inches apart, the patches consisting of about 
half a dozen roots placed near together ; these 
bloom about May. The bed may be edged at 



56

the time of planting with double snowdrops, 
which will flower in January. In February 
the bed may be planted over thinly with 
Clarhia pulchella, sown in September, kept 
in a frame to flower in April and May. 
In May the place of the ranunculus, which 
are to be taken to the reserve garden, is to 
be occupied by Gladiolus natalensis (orange 
mottled), which, if potted in springand brought 
forward in the frames, will flower finely in 
July and August. This bed may have an 
edging of mignonette, planted out in March, 
and a succession crop sown at the same 
time. 

No. 19 is to be planted in October with 
patches nine inches apart of Anemone hortensis 
(rosy-purple) ; it will flower in April and 
May ; the bed may be edged with snowdrops, 
as in No. 18. In February, fill between the 
plants with Godetia rubicunda (rosy), sown in 
September, to bloom in May and June. In 
May, as soon as the anemones are out of 
flower, they must be removed, and their place 
taken by Tigridia pavonia, planted in pots in 
February, and brought forward in a frame ; 
these will bloom from June to September. 
The bed may be edged with mignonette as in 
No. 18. 

No. 20 is to be occupied by ranunculus 
(Yellow turban), planted as in No. 18, and 
edged in the same way with snowdrops, the 
latter blooming in January, and the former in 
May. In February, the bed is to be planted 
between the ranunculus, with Collinsia bicolor 
(white and lilac), sown in August, in pots, and 
got forward in the frames ; this will bloom in 
March and April. In May the bed is to be 
planted in place of the ranunculus with Gladio- 
lus floribundus (pink), potted in spring, and 
brought forward in frames to flower in June 
and July. The bed may be edged with 
mignonette, as in No. 18. 

No. 21 is to be planted in October with 
patches of Anemone apennina (blue), at nine 
inches apart ; this blooms in March and April ; 
it may be edged with snowdrops, which flower 
in January. In February it may be planted 
with stocks (scarlet ten weeks), raised in pots 
in August, and kept in frames ; these flower 
in April and May. In May, the anemone3 
are replaced by Gladiolus cardinalis, potted 
in spring, and brought forward in frames, so 
as to flower in June and July. The bed may 
be edged with mignonette, as No. 18. 

No. 22 is planted in October, at nine inches 
apart, with strong plants of hepaticas (double 
and single blue alternately) ; these bloom in 
February and March. It may be intermixed 
or edged at the time of planting with Scilla 
bifolia rubra (pink), which blooms in March 
and April. In May, it may be planted with 
verbena (purple variety — Emma), raised from 



cuttings in August, and kept in frames, and 
grown on so as to be nearly or quite in bloom; 
these keep flowering till October, or till 
destroyed by frost. 

No. 23 is planted in October with Winter 
aconite (yellow), intermixed or edged with 
Cyclamen coum (red), the former bloom- 
ing in January and February, the latter in 
March. Early in May, verbenas (lilac variety 
— Lovely Rambler) may be planted out as 
in No. 22. 

No. 24 is planted in October with hepa- 
ticas (double and single red), intermixed with 
Scilla bifolia or avicena (both blue), the former 
blooming in February and March, the latter 
in March and April. In May, the bed may be 
planted with verbenas (scarlet variety — Melin- 
dres major), as in No. 22. 

No. 25 is to be filled in October with 
double snowdrops (white), intermixed with 
Hyacinthus amethystinus (blue), the former 
blooming in January, and the latter in April. 
In May the beds may be filled with verbenas 
(crimson variety — Tweedieana), planted as in 
No. 22. 

In November and December, which are 
thus unprovided with flowers, the liveliness 
of the flower-garden is in some measure 
kept up by plunging small evergreens in 
pots, between the bulbs. A selection of 
choice kinds of evergreens, including the 
different variegated plants, and accompanied 
by others with various coloured berries, forms 
a very good substitute for flowers at that 
season. 

There are two or three general remarks in 
connexion with this system of planting flower- 
gardens, which it may be desirable to make. 
In the first place, where it is recommended to 
plant out any of the plants in February, this 
is presuming on the recurrence of fine weather, 
and the planting out should only be done 
under such circumstances ; in addition to 
which, if it becomes very cold afterwards, 
some protection at night must be afforded. 
Another point is, that all the plants brought 
from the greenhouses, or frames, to the flower- 
garden, must be perfectly ;< hardened off," as 
it is termed ; that is, they must by degrees 
have been so perfectly inured to exposure as 
to be able to bear it without injury, before 
they are risked in the garden. Another point 
is, that the different kinds of plants must not 
be allowed to spoil each other by being 
crowded ; where they are getting too thick 
they must be thinned, as far as may be neces- 
sary, the less important crop being sacrificed 
to the better. In general, the batch of annuals 
planted in February, are to be regarded as the 
make-up crop. Especially at the edges of the 
beds, if any shoots are growing beyond the 
proper bounds, they must be cut in, so that

the outline of the beds may be preserved ; this 
is very essential. Also if any branches grow 
up too high among the rest, they are to be 
shortened down in a similar manner, so as to 
keep the groups dwarf, symmetrical, and com- 
pact. Finally, if any of the sets of plants 
happen, as they sometimes will, to grow faster 
than was calculated on, and pass out of flower 
before their allotted time, or if their proper 
blooming season does not quite extend to the 
end of summer, in either case, some temporary 
crop of such plants as may be at hand, must 
be planted to supply the deficiency. 

The most correct system for geometrical 
flower gardens is, to plant the groups, so that 
every corresponding bed may present the 
same kind of plant, and the same colour, and 
the only objection that can be urged to this plan 
is, that as there are at least two beds of each 
kind of flower, there must be less variety in 
the whole. On this arrangement, Nos. 2 and 
4 in the diagram given above, Nos. 3 and 5, 6 
and 8, 7 and 9, 11 and 14, 10 and 15, 12 and 
16, 13 and 17, 19 and 21, 18 and 20, 23 and 
25, 22 and 24, would be filled with the same 
identical kinds of plants. When the flower 
garden is seen from any elevated position, 
when it can be easily comprehended in one 
view, this mode of planting is desirable, and 
■very effective ; but if the garden is not so 
viewed, it is really of little importance, be- 
cause, when the beds are seen only from the 
same level, the effect of such an arrangement, 
not being taken in at one view, is lost sight of, 
and the system thus becomes virtually ineffec- 
tive. 

No one who has a flower garden, and 
values its productions, should be unaware that 
success is impracticable in the vicinity of 
large trees. Flowers will not thrive under the 
shade and drip of trees, neither will they suc- 
ceed if the trees are so close, so as to prevent 
a free circulation of air. Again, if they are 
at all near, their roots work up into the 
better soil, made for the flowers, and rob it of 
its virtues, often completely occupying it with 
their matted roots. This happens to a much 
greater distance than could be supposed. 
Elm trees are very hurtful in this way. 
Though hardly doing injury by its shade, yet 
on account of its thickly matting roots the lilac 
is very destructive to flowers ; if the roots once 
gain access to the better soil of the flower 
border, the latter will soon be filled with a 
close matted cluster of its roots, which will 
successfully rob the plants of all their nourish- 
ment, and starve, if not destroy them. Many 
other trees and shrubs are injurious in the 
same way ; and they often do this injury 
when they are so far off as to be unsus- 
pected. 

Conservative walls. — Walls for the protec- 



tion and shelter of many half-hardy plants, 
and the choicer climbing shrubs, are a valuable 
acquisition to the flower garden. Where 
there is a terrace walk facing the south, por- 
tions of wall, on the north side of this 
walk, are very appropriate for the purpose ; 
and in small suburban gardens, where the 
whole area is surrounded by a wall, that por- 
tion attached to the ground, occupied by 
flowers, ought to be devoted in this way. 
The southern aspect is, in general, preferable ; 
but where more than one aspect can be ob- 
tained, the season of any particular flowers 
may be prolonged, especially if the plants are 
managed with such a view. 

The principle or advantage of a conserva- 
tive wall is, that the wall acts as a protection 
from cold, and in some measure elevates the 
temperature ; consequently, with the addi- 
tional covering of light shutters or blinds, 
fixed with rollers to let up and down, a suffi- 
cient degree of protection is afforded for the 
cultivation of such plants as are too tender to 
endure our winters. Plants of this nature, 
planted out with this object, should not be 
mixed with those of a hardier character, as 
the protection afforded to the former would 
injure, rather than benefit the latter. Each of 
these classes of plants should therefore be con- 
fined to certain portions of the wall, the best 
situations being afforded to the most tender. 
This principle of protection may be carried 
out in a variety of ways, and in different 
degrees ; in short, the protection afforded may 
vary from the slightest that can be adopted 
to the covering of the wall with glazed sashes, 
which latter would provide nearly as much 
shelter as a greenhouse. By far the most 
essential part of the plan, so far as regards 
the growth of half-hardy and tender plants, is 
to have the soil rendered comparatively dry 
by thorough drainage. In this respect the 
preparation of the soil for such a purpose is 
very similar to that of forming borders for 
fruit trees, only the drainage should, if possi- 
ble, be still more perfect. In the preparation 
of the soil, too, there is some similarity, for 
a highly manured soil is hurtful in both cases ; 
in fact, fresh soil of an open texture is much 
more proper, inasmuch as it will secure a 
moderately healthy and solid, rather than 
an over-luxuriant and watery growth, such 
growth being far more likely to be preserved 
through the winter. 

In the case of such ornamental walls, the 
plants should be trained on a trellis, and not 
nailed directly to the wall, the former being 
a much neater, and less troublesome plan. 
The plants are all supposed to be planted out 
into the prepared soil, and the shoots trained 
assiduously until the space is filled, when 
they should be allowed to grow more unre- 



58

strainedly, being pruned on the spur system, 
so as to throw out a number of short shoots 
from the wall ; this will break the formality 
apparent in trained plants, and will in most 
cases secure abundance of bloom. Such situa- 
tions are not, however, intended solely for 
climbing plants ; others of a shrubby and 
evergreen nature are quite appropriate, and 
as an instance the Camellia may be men- 
tioned ; these plants would bloom to perfection 
in such a situation. The various plants must 
not be allowed to interfere with each other's 
growth, nor the strongest to overpower the 
weakest ; each by the free use of the pruning 
knife, and the judicious removal of the grow- 
ing shoots, must be restrained within its 
proper bounds. In general, the climbing 
plants may occupy the upper part of the sur- 
face, while the shrubby plants fill up the 
spaces near the base. In some instances 
where these walls have been erected, and 
glass sashes provided, flues have also been 
built in the walls, connected with furnaces 
situated at the back : when this is done the 
situation is fully equal to a greenhouse, and 
any plants usually kept in a greenhouse might 
be planted. 

One of the most complete walls of this kind 
is that at Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, where 
the experience of some years has proved 
highly successful. This wall has the appear- 
ance of being formed of alternately receding 
and projecting compartments, supported by 



massive pillars. The receding parts are those 
which are protected, the others being covered 
with hardy plants. At about a foot and a half 
from the front of these recesses, a glazed sash 
is placed, which, when in its place, covers the 
plants, and when not required is made to slide 
behind the projecting compartment ; thus the 
plants can be covered or exposed with very 
little trouble. Of course the same principle 
of covering might be carried out with canvass 
or other screens less expensive than glass ; or 
protection might be afforded by the less orna- 
mental plan of employing blinds to be let up 
and down at pleasure by means of rollers ; this 
would do very well for many plants, though of 
course not for the very tender kinds, because 
as the blinds would more or less exclude light, 
they could not, without injury, be continued 
over the plants for any length of time, as 
might be necessary in severe weather. 

Without any other shelter than that afforded 
by the wall itself, aided by the complete drain- 
age of the soil, a number of the most beautiful 
half-hardy shrubs introduced to this country, 
and which are just too tender to stand our 
winters when planted out openly, might be 
grown so as to form very interesting objects. 
Such plants are the half-hardy species of Ber- 
beris, of Magnolia, of Escallonia, of Clianthus, 
of Clematis, of Rosa, of Arbutus, of Chimo- 
nanthus, of Ceanothus, of Lonicera, and many 
others. Such plants should be planted while 
young, and trained so as to cover the wall. 




BUILDINGS FOR HORTICULTURAL PURPOSES. 



As many persons are deterred from build- 
ing greenhouses and conservatories by the 
expense, or rather the supposed expense of 
their erection, it ought to be generally known 
that by going a proper way to work there is 
hardly an excuse for being without these 
luxuries, (for such we deem them.) in any 



moderate garden. It is true that those per- 
sons who set themselves up as builders of 
such concerns, and who would make it appear 
that there is something peculiar that takes 
them out of the ordinary builder's business, 
do charge very exorbitantly for all kinds of 
horticultural buildings ; and where money

appears to be no object, they do not forget to 
throw a good deal of cost into certain features 
which are no improvements, and which add 
no single advantage to the concern. By 
adopting circular forms and domes, by arrang- 
ing designs so as to cause irregular cutting 
for the glass, by bringing in subjects out of 
the usual size, and using material that is diffi- 
cult to procure or work, it is very easy to 
swell the cost of anything ; and it becomes 
simply a question of a great expenditure or 
none, for the party who wishes to build ; and 
often ends in their declining altogether to have 
anything of the kind erected. 



Let us, then, see how economically we can 
build a greenhouse and a conservatory, and 
we will reduce the thing to lines and figures, 
so that our readers may add the cost of carry- 
ing material, and of the labour on the spot, to 
put them together, and so see how much it 
would cost them ; or they may find builders 
on the spot, to complete the whole, without 
having any portion from London. 

There are to be had many carpenters who 
are clever at such work, and who will execute 
the woodwork of any of these buildings at one 
shilling per foot. Suppose, therefore, we calcu- 
late that a lean-to greenhouse, Fig. 1, has three 




Fig. 1. 



feet of woodwork upright in front, and two 
six-feet lights from back to front, and three 
feet six inches wide, and that there be ten of 
these lights side by side to make the length of 
the house, which would then be thirty-seven 
feet. Suppose the tops are sloped so as to 
give us ten feet for the depth of the house, 
there would then be, three times 37 feet, 
(111) for the upright front, and twelve times 
37 feet (444) for the roof, and say sixty feet 
for each end (120). The doors will add about 
20 feet. "We now get at the total number of 
feet, which is 695, which number of shillings, 
thirty-four pounds fifteen shillings, gives us 
the carpenter's work. We will reckon the 
glazing of the roof, or 444 feet, at 4|fZ. — 
eight pounds three shillings and twopence, 
and the rest of the glass, 231 at 8d. — seven 
pounds fourteen shillings. There would be 
wanting the price of the bricklayer's work 



only to complete this building, this depending 
a little upon the price of the material in the 
locality, for sometimes the distance the bricks 
have to be drawn makes a good deal of differ- 
ence ; but the height of the brickwork, say 
eighteen inches in the ground, and two feet 
six out of the ground, together four feet, 
with the ends fifty-seven feet in length. This 
should be nine-inch work ; say it will cost ten 
pounds, making sixty pounds, and under 
sixty-one. The heating of a house like this 
would require a conical boiler, say three 
pounds ; and eighty feet of pipe, at eighteen 
pence, six pounds ; and fixing, say two 
pounds more. Here, then, is a first-rate range 
of greenhouses, thirty-seven feet long and ten 
feet wide, for about seventy pounds, as hand- 
some as it can be built, and all complete. A con- 
servatory, Fig. 2, the same length and double 
the width, and with glass to the bottom, may be 




reckoned at double the sum, and no one could 
doubt of the effective appearance of this style 
of building for both. The annexed sketches 
of a greenhouse and conservatory will give an 
idea of the buildings alluded to in the foregoing 
notice. The prices mentioned are quite the 



outside, and include all the fastenings, hinges, 
and necessary means of heating. The filling 
up of the inside is so completely a matter of 
taste, that it is impossible to say what would 
be the cost, until the intended plan is known. 
The best way to fit up a greenhouse is with a 



60 



BUILDINGS FOR HORTICULTURAL PURPOSES. 



table or rack in front, two feet wide, and 
shelves the form of the roof at the other side 
of the path. Fig. 3. 

The conservatories may be fitted rather 
differently, for the object there is to make it 
a sort of winter garden. There should be 
a broad walk all round, laid with the finest 




Under this rack should be placed the hot water 
pipes for heating, a gutter being formed just 
below the surface to make room for them. 
This shelf or rack is to hold pots of blooming 
plants, with which it should be kept supplied. 
The ties which are necessary across the roof, 
and pillars which are usually placed at given 
distances, are so many useful supports for 
climbing plants, and the centre bed should be 
planted with much more regard to after-effect 
than any we have seen, for even that at the 
Horticultural Society is crowded with coarse, 
worthless subjects, which are damaging or 
banishing altogether much better things. A 
section of the conservatory would be some- 
thing like Fig. 4. The path round might 
be of marble or Portland stone, but it is 
better to have it like the principal gravel 
walks ; and with regard to the planting, 
the middle should have the tallest subjects, 
not at the moment they are planted, per- 
haps, but those which are naturally tallest, 
and which are sure to go up. Camellia japo- 
nica, a few of the choicest kinds ; Azalea 
indica according to their habit, the tallest in 
the middle. Nearly all the hard-wooded 
plants of the Cape will do well, but a choice 
should be made of those that will be most 
effective. 

The conservatory is used by many as a 
common greenhouse, and the plants in pots 
are crowded into it for the winter ; but the 
luxury of the conservatory is absent altogether, 
unless it is heated as a winter garden. The 
centre should be dug like a border, and some 
plants should be put out as if they were 
shrubs in the open ground ; others may be 
plunged in pots for the sake of their bloom 
while in flower, and be removed for others 
as they pass their bloom ; but the conserva- 
tory should be supplied by means of other 
houses and pits with plants coming into per- 



binding gravel. The centre should be pre- 
pared for planting, and the borders should be 
glass, which is the most neat and elegant, as 
well as lasting of all borders. As the glass of 
the windows reach to within a trifle of the 
ground, there may be a rack or shelf one foot 
wide even with the bottom of the glass.

fection, and removable when their beauty has 
gone. By this means it may be kept one 
mass of flowers the whole year round, and 
especially grand and imposing during the 
winter months, when the Camellia japonica, 
with its random flowers, begins lighting up the 
houses, which even without forcing, but with a 
little management, can be produced flowering 
in abundance. All other early spring subjects 
can be hastened to bloom in winter ; and sum- 
mer flowering plants can be easily forwarded 
to bloom in spring. There are some things, 
however, so beautiful in themselves in all 
their stages, that they deserve a place in the 
conservatory as permanent plants, and may 
be planted out in the centre beds to remain. 
Of these the Camellia japonica is one of the 
most striking, and three or four of the best 
kinds should be selected. The Azalea indica, 
Hovea Celsi, and a few others known to suc- 
ceed well in such situations, should be planted 
out ; and there are some few climbing plants 
worthy of a place in the very best selections. 
This, however, only explains the reason for 
some of the provisions made in a proper con- 
servatory ; our notions are that span build- 
ings should have ties, and these ties may be 
made subservient to our purposes, for climb- 
ing plants look best when allowed to run 
across the roof, as it were, and hang, as they 
will, in festoons, and their ends form complete 
receivers of flowers. The style and the build 
of these erections must depend a good deal 
on their situations, and the places adjoining : 
several of the sketches are given to show how 
they may be viewed. There is a method, too, 
of heating them, somewhat different to that 
which we have mentioned. For instance, a 
gutter may be made under the floor, if it is 
wished to conceal the pipes, or the gutter 
may be made waterproof and covered with 
iron plates, and this could be used as a tank,

and the water flow round the house in them, 
instead of in pipes. But we know of nothing 
better than pipes, and should always use them 
in preference. 

To go from the consideration of these to 
other buildings. "We have to mention that as 
the top lights constitute the principal expense 
in pits and frames, stoves, and propagating 
houses, they may be had for fetching at less 
than a shilling per foot glazed complete and 
primed. Who would be without plenty of 
glass ? The stove is important. It should, 
in a small establishment, be made to answer 
for any thing of the stove kind, though many 
people are so prejudiced against this general 
treatment of all plants. These may be con- 
trived in the same building, placed in the 
different degrees of heat that may be formed, 



or rather made, in the same house. There 
can be always found appropriate places for 
different things ; and it is worth while to keep 
also different degrees of dampness by artificial 
means. In the stove or hothouse, Mr. Penns' 
system for circulating the air is the most advi- 
sable plan for heating the house. This plan 
consists of giving off the heated air at the 
lowest portion of the house, that it may spread 
up the roof, and, as it falls, returning under 
the floor or false bottom to the place where 
the fires continue to heat it as it passes 
from time to time, by which means a rapid 
uninterrupted circulation is kept up, and 
greatly contributes to the health of the 
plants. The section of a hothouse upon 
this plan would be something like Fig. 5. 
On a large scale, this would be a most 




L_J 



Fig. 5. 



effective plan, for there is nothing more simple, 
and when one of the pits constructed on this 
plan is closed, the circulation of air is re- 
markably strong: holes are left, through which 
air may be admitted at pleasure ; but it is not 
often required. The brick-work in the stove 
is more expensive than in a greenhouse or 
conservatory, and the false bottom under 
which the cooled air passes from the back to 
the front, rather increases the labour ; but in 
houses in which the tan pits are built, they 
would form an obstacle to the free circulation 
of air, if it were not for a grating at the back 
to let it down under the floor as it cools, and 
another grating under the pipes to let the 
cooled air come up again between them to be 
warmed again. The wood-work and glazing 
of a stove is no more than that of a green- 
house, and the build is much the same, except 
that the house should be deeper from back to 
front. The operation of the boiler and pipes 
is very simple, and may be understood from 
the following diagram (Fig. 6), for, turn and 
twist the pipes as you may, all that is re- 
quired, is, that one end goes out at the 
top of the boiler, and the other end returns 
in at the bottom of the boiler. Thus the 




Fig. 6. 




Fig. 7. 

boiler is like two inverted flower-pots, one 
less than the other, and the water is between 
the inner one which holds the fire, and the 
outer one which is exposed. The fuel is put 
in at top and shut down. The flue is pro- 
vided for in the fixing. This boiler would 
feed hundreds of feet of pipe, and it is per- 
haps the simplest and best of the many plans 
for heating horticultural buildings ; due re- 
gard being had to the capacity and the eco- 
nomy of the thing, for both are objects worthy 
of attention. It is easily managed, for when 
the fire is lighted well, the aperture may be 
filled to the top and covered over, the regu- 
lator of the flue being so far closed as to allow 
of slow steady combustion. If a tank for hot 
water is preferred to tan in the interior pit, 
the tank may be made about eight inches 
deep, or from that to ten, the top must be 
closed with large slates, cemented together, 
leaving only one aperture to open at pleasure ; 
this may be heated by sending the usual iron 
pipes through the tank ; on the top of this tank 
may be placed a foot of tan or soil, or any 
other medium in which to plunge pots, or 
plant whatever is to be grown. The top of 
one (Fig. 7), is open to show the pipes, the

other {Fig. 8), closed, to show the slates ; but 
the water in the tank may come direct from 
the boiler, in which case the circulation takes 
place in the boiler ; a partition, such as is 
shown (Fig. 9), facilitates the circulation

atmosphere of the house. In the manage- 
ment of these pipes, there is a choice of allow- 



greatly, though it would act without any par- 
tition, but the circulation would not be so 
direct or so complete. The adoption of a tank 
for bottom heat does not render the usual ones 
a bit less necessary for the regulation of the

from the pipes, and after circulating in the 
tank, going out again through the returning 



ing the pipes to go through the tank and pipes : in this case, the tank would be thus : —

affecting the main plan, and the saving of 
tan in the pit will be a considerable object, 
especially in localities that require it to be 
drawn any distance, for the cartage is fre- 
quently a good deal more costly than the 
material itself. We should always set our 
faces against any of the complicated systems 
for heating houses. The more all operations 
can be simplified the better, and changes are 
always bad, if the plan in operation answers 
the purpose at all well. The construction of 
ordinary plant preservers, admits of great 
variety, because there may be every degree 
of heat and coolness ; from the brick-built pit 
that is without any means of heating, to the 
necessary heat for stove plants, and there is 
scarcely any description of erection upon 
which there is so much money wasted ; and 
this expenditure is often the result of collusion 
between interested persons. Builders too often 



induce those who can influence masters to 
have very useless things built, and it has been 
greatly encouraged by the garden newspapers, 
recommending one ridiculous contrivance after 
another, much to the disadvantage of the 
gardeners who have the management of the 
concerns, and who no sooner get used to the 
things they have, than they are called upon to 
adopt something else no better — perhaps no 
worse, but nevertheless not a little expensive. 
A range of pits three feet high at the back, 
and fifteen or eighteen inches high in front, 
six feet from back to front — the glass and 
wood-work of such a pit would be little ex- 
pense, for the glass ought to be small, and the 
whole might be comprised in a shilling a foot, 
or three pounds every ten feet of length : 
ranges of pits of this description {Fig. 11), 
will preserve heaths and hard-wooded plants, 
with good covering, against frost, without any 




Fig. 11. 



artificial heat, and they are the most useful of 
all the subsidiary buildings in a garden. If 
it be desirable, or necessary to preserve the 
surplus of stove plants, a single row of iron 
pipe, back and front, heated from any boiler, 



will answer the purpose ; and if to preserve 
orchideous plants, the only additional pre- 
caution required, will be to provide the moist 
atmosphere ; but a pit of this kind, without 
much moisture, will be excellent as a resting

place for those nut intended to grow for a 
while. Camellias do well in such pits, without 
any fire heat, and only require to be closed 
and covered during the hardest frosts. Several 
ranges of such pits adapted to the plants they 
are to hold, may be erected in an appropriate 
place in front of each other; as, however, some 
require only cucumbers, and cannot obtain 
stable dung, one of the pits should be heated 
upon the tank system, like that already pro- 
posed for heating the centre pit of a stove : 
the construction in this case must be the same, 
and it will be well to carry out the plan of 
the hollow or false bottom for the circula- 
tion of air, for that will always be found 
an acquisition where it can be done con- 
veniently. It is only necessary to obtain ad- 
ditional height for the room taken up by the 
depth of the tank ; many, however, prefer for 
pits, dung heat ; in this case, the wall of the 
pit must be perforated with holes, or rather 
must be built with holes, leading to a hollow 
chamber, over which the bed is formed, and 
outside the wall must be a second wall, and 
a trench between them {Fig. 12), or there 
are others who have archways leading to the 
chamber, and thrust the dung into it, raking 
it oat and putting a hot supply whenever the 
other gets too cold, so as to allow the heat of 
the bed to decline too much ; many, however, 
will do more with a common hot bed and 
garden frame, than others can do with all the 
expensive contrivances of modern buildings, 
and this may be called the most unpretending 
and useful of all garden constructions. We 



believe we have gone through all the abso- 
lutely necessary buildings for a garden, for 
one or other of these may be used for peach, 
cherry, or fig houses, forcing house, or by 
whatever other name they may be called. 
The stove is fit for a pinery. The same con- 
trivance in lower pits will do for succession 
plants. The form of the greenhouse, with ap- 
propriate means of heating, will do for grapes, 
and if we make any other particular altera- 
tion, it would be in favour of orchideous 
plants, but even here, we should deviate but 
little from the ordinary stove, except by mak- 
ing shelves and places whereon to hang the 
various contrivances to hold the plants, for 
when they are in flower, the conservatory 
should be their place, and when not in flower, 
there need be no great pains taken to render 
the house commodious for visitors, unless, 
indeed, there be what may be called a show 
orchideous house, in which case the paths may 
be wider, and an open tank of water, not to 
be heated, except by the natural warmth of 
the place. This house, however, might be 
made a sort of stove conservatory, and if so, 
there may be any fanciful flower adopted that 
may suit the taste of the owner. We, however, 
do not profess to find a hundred plans for 
structures, on which no two persons' tastes 
would be indulged alike, and therefore leave 
this part of the subject for others, for each 
one will give a different opinion, and furnish 
a different design. 

As a protection for plants on walls, without 
heat, one of the most simple plans is to use 





Fig. 12. 



Fig. 13. 



the lights of a common pit placed in a sloping 
position {Fig. 13), and for a great preser- 
vation against the falling frosts, a coping 
should be always built on the wall. The 
lights may be placed close together, side by 
side, to extend the range as far as may be 
desirable, and the ends may be closed with 
mats. As a protection for climbing plants 
that are a little tender, it is very efficacious, 
for the coping prevents the heavy rains from 
trickling down the wall ; and there is nothing 
more fatal to half-hardy plants that are nailed 
against a wall, than wet in winter. The 



upper portion of the glass rests under the 
coping, so that no wet can get behind it. We 
have seen it recommended to place the entire 
frame against the wall, and the lights put on 
the frames. Of course, in such case, the 
small front of the frame is placed upwards. 
This is purely theoretical, no man could re- 
duce it to practice without finding out that 
the wood work could not be put close to the 
wall, unless all the stems of the trees or plants 
are nobbed into the wood-work, nor would 
the wood-work of the back, which is to be next 
the ground, lay even unless the border were

level (which is not so in one of twenty places), 
or as it were, propped to a level; again, the plan 
would be useless if the border had any other 
plants on it ; again, wooden frames for lights 
are rarely more than six feet from back to 
front, so that all above six feet high would be 
exposed. The plan may do on paper, but 
not in practice. The lights of pits are, for 
the most part, from seven to nine feet long; 
and in all gardens there should be as much 
uniformity in the size of the lights as possible. 
All wooden frames for hot-beds should be five 
and a half to six feet long, and three and a 
half wide. All pits should be from seven and 
a half to nine feet, by four, to four and a half 
wide ; but it saves immense trouble to have 
all the pit lights of the same dimensions ; 
they are more handy to stow away, it matters 
not where they are used, and it is proper 
always to have a few spare ones. In using 
these lights against a wall, no matter whether 
one or a dozen be required, the ends have 
simply to be matted to keep out the cold ; 
and whether there be six feet or sixty thus 
protected, there are but the two ends to mat. 
There are several considerations against using 
the wood framing; among these, the flat top 
being exposed, the rain will run in somewhere, 
for there is nothing to keep it out : in the 
next place, the glass is too far from the plants. 
The advantage of using the light only is that 
it can be placed nearly upright if necessary, 
or sloping out; and in very severe winters mats 
can be used all over them, and be easily kept 
in their places ; not so if they project like a 
frame. If it be proposed to have framing on 
purpose, why, we might as well build a green- 
house at once. Our diagram gives a very 
good idea of what we propose, both as to the 
coping and the glass ; a slate coping is all 
that need be put. This material is no weight 
for the wall, will easily fasten, and although 
much has been said for and against copings to 
walls, it is one of those instances of contro- 
versy in which one or both parties look but to 
one side of the question. One says the trees 
on a wall ought to have all the rain, and the 
coping is only good in winter ; but all things 



under artificial treatment require to be 
managed consistently all through. We all 
know Avails are a great protection to fruit- 
trees, as well as other plants ; but they have 
their evils as well as their benefit, unless we 
counteract them. The trees on a wall require 
the nourishment of the rains from which they 
are shielded, because when the wind is blowing 
from the back, the rain never touches them ; 
but if we, by artificial treatment, deprive a plant 
of any particular advantage, it is our business 
to supply it. Wall fruit-trees, under proper 
management, have the advantage of moisture 
over their foliage, when they want it only, 
and thus escape an excess of wet which those 
unprotected do not. This moisture is supplied 
by syringes, and not one gardener in two takes 
the trouble to give it them. Syringing is 
one of the most efficacious operations imagin- 
able; nothing keeps a plant so clear of vermin; 
nothing disturbs the pests of the walls so 
much. The fineness or coarseness of the 
holes through which the water is forced deter- 
mines the force with which it can be thrown 
against the trees. Before the buds open at all, 
it cannot be too strong, for the use of it then 
is to clean the stems, and wash out the dirt 
and vermin or eggs that may be behind them. 
When the growth is young and tender, it can 
hardly be too fine, for although driven with 
as much force as we can from the engine, 
there is no weight in such small particles to 
damage the young growth. Now the syring- 
ing under glass becomes still more necessary, 
so also does it under a coping, for as neither 
the rains sloping from the back, nor the down- 
right rains can reach the plant, it would lose 
the necessary moisture altogether, if not arti- 
ficially supplied. Pegs may be driven into the 
ground to prevent the light from slipping 
outwards, or a narrow board with a ledge 
for them to rest on, and when it is neces- 
sary to remove the lights, there will be no 
vestiges of the temporary protection remain- 
ing. The coping to the walls is found very 
beneficial to many half-hardy and tender 
climbing \ lants, and is never detrimental to 
anything.

Plant and Transplant artichokes, balm, 
cabbages, cauliflower, horse-radish, herbs, gar- 
lic, liquorice, potatoes,shallots, sorrel, and tansy. 
General Directions. — Finish shortly the 
principal digging and trenching ; turn up the 
ridged and dug ground ; wheel in frosty wea- 
ther. Make a general preparation of the soil, 
for putting in the seeds, planting, &c. ; stir 
the soil, when dry, between advancing crops. 
In unfavourable weather for out-door ope- 
rations, prepare stakes, tallies, &c. ; look over 
the onions, carrots, beet, and other stored roots. 

Artichokes {Globe). — If not sown, do it 
immediately; and forward, by placing in heat. 

Artichokes (Jerusalem). — Prepare ground 
for them by trenching and manuring well : 
a light soil is desirable : where a screen or 
blind is wanted in summer, they answer ad- 
mirably. 

Asparagus. — New plantations maybe made; 
trench the ground three feet deep, and add 
fresh turfy loam, sand, and rotten dung, in 
quantity depending upon the nature of the 

48. 



soil ; it must be made rich, and sea-weed, if 
at hand, is an excellent material ; divide the 
ground into four-feet beds, with two-feet 
alleys between ; put three rows into each 
bed ; take up the plants with a fork carefully ; 
lay them in trenches, which should be nine 
inches deep ; keep the plants eight inches 
apart, and the crowns two inches below the 
surface. Prepare ground for seed sowing in 
an open space, by dunging and trenching it 
well ; the seed must be sown next month. 

Halm. — Divide the old roots, and plant at 
fifteen inches between the rows, and one foot 
in the row. 

Basil. — Sow in a gentle heat, about the 
middle of the month, in sandy loam and leaf 
mould, equal parts. 

Beans. — Make another planting towards 
the end of the month ; earth up the advanc- 
ing crops, a little high at the edge, so as to 
protect from keen winds. 

Beet. — Sow a little about the end of the 
month, in rows sixteen inches apart ; sow 
thick ; and plant in a favourable situation, 
those kept for seed. 

Brocoli. — Secure the early heads from 
frost, by cutting, and placing them in a cool 
room or cellar ; cut them six inches below 
the flower, divest the stalk of its leaves, and 
insert it amongst damp sand. 

Brussels Sprouts. — Stake the tall plants ; 
pick only those sprouts which are firm and 
large, allowing the others time to improve. 

Burnet. — Sow in rows fourteen inches 
apart, or divide the old roots ; a few plants 
will suffice ; any common soil will suit it.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY 



Cabbages. — Plant a full crop of those which 
were pricked out; put them rather thick, as 
they can he thinned early, and used as cole- 
worts. Sow again at the end of the month, 
and red cabbage also, if not sown in autumn. 

Carrots. — Sow in a slight hot-bed early ; 
and late in the month, sow also a few on a 
warm border. Protect, in severe weather, 
those in frames, and give air plentifully. 

Cauliflower. — Near the end of the month, 
plant out at two feet apart, on a rich and 
warm spot, a few of the strongest, which have 
been kept through the winter, and protect 
them with spruce branches. In mild weather 
take off the lights from those in frames ; shift 
a few of those in pots, and do not allow them 
to get dry and stunted : sow a few for.succes- 
sion under glass. 

Celery. — Sow a little at the end of the 
month, in the stove or hot-bed ; it is likely to 
run to seed, but it will be useful in the kit- 
chen. When any sort proves good, preserve 
a few plants for seed, and plant them against 
a wall, or in a warni situation ; keep earthing 
up the late crops when dry and mild. 

Chervil. — Sow in any spare corner ; a few 
plants will be sufficient. 

Clary. — Sow at the end of the month, on 
a liorbt but rich soil. 

Coriander. — Unless there is a demand for 
it, a very few plants will suffice ; raise them 
in heat. 

Endive. — Look over those being preserved 
in pits or frames ; clear away all appearance 
of damp ; give air at back and front ; and 
when required for use, remove the plant 
wholly. 

Fennel. — Transplant to any spare corner ; 
a plant or two will be plenty. 

Herbs, as mint, pennyroyal, hyssop, &c. 
should be increased by division or slips, as 
required ; they will all do in ordinary soil. 

Horse-radish. — Plant fresh beds at once ; 
put cuttings of the roots at the bottom of a 
trench at least so deep as to give one foot of 
clear root when grown. 

Leeks. — Preserve and plant some of the 
good heads, where they will ripen their seed : 
sow a few at the end of the month. 

Lettuce. — Look over those in frames ; keep 
them a little dry, and stir up the soil amongst 
them, also among those against the walls, and 
in hand lights : prick out the young plants 
sown last month. 

Liquorice may be grown from seed ; but 
it is usually and properly increased by divi- 
sion of the roots. Plant eighteen inches 
apart, and three inches in the row, in deeply 
trenched soil. 

Marjoram. — Sow anytime this month in 
a warm border ; afterwards plant in rows a 
foot apart. 



Onions. — Prepare for the main crops ; the 
ground should have been trenched, well 
manured, and ridged; now have it levelled, 
and if a quantity of leaf-mould, and a little 
pigeons' dung or guano, were worked in the 
surface, they will come up more sure and 
even. Stir the soil amongst the autumn 
sown crops, and clean thoroughly. 

Parsley. — Sow, if not done ; it is suitable 
for an edging ; give it a rich, rather dry, and 
stony soil, and one of the best situations in 
the garden. 

Parsnip. — Break up the ground well, and 
sow in rows at eighteen inches apart, at the 
end of the month. 

Peas. — Transplant those raised in heat to 
the wall borders about the end of the month ; 
also earth and stake them. Sow again on a 
warm border, say three feet apart ; it is well 
to tally the whole, naming the sorts, and when 
sown, &c. 

Potatoes. — Plant the general crops ; if 
done in autumn, it is all the better. The early 
sorts which should be stai'ted in heat, and a 
little confined in the roots, may be planted 
alongside the south wall, and slightly pro- 
tected ; manure them principally with leaf- 
mould. 

Rape. — Sow in any common soil about the 
end of the month. 

~Radish.es. — Sow early, for succession, in a 
very sheltered place, or what is better, in a 
frame where they will have a gentle heat, and 
plenty of air : sow twice this month. 

Sage. — Divide and transplant the old roots; 
or sow in a bed, and plant out at a foot apart. 

Savory. — Sow at the end of the month, on 
a warm border, rather thick, in good soil. 

Savoys. — Sow a few at the end of the 
month, in light and rich soil. 

Salading, as mustard, cress, must be sown 
every fortnight upon a warm sheltered spot ; 
forward it by placing handlights over it ; it 
will be well still to have a little in heat. 

Salsify and Scorzonera. — The ground for 
these crops should be well wrought, and in an 
open situation ; sow next month. 

Skirret. — Sow at the end of the month, in 
rows a foot apart, or increase by the roots. 

Shallots. — Plant in shallow drills, giving 
the bulb a gentle press into the soil, and no 
direct covering ; put them six inches apart, 
and fifteen inches between the rows. 

Sorrel. — Increase by division, and put in 
rows fifteen inches apart, and nine between 
plants. Dress the old plantations if required. 

Spinach. — Make small sowings at the be- 
ginning and end of the month ; thin, clean, 
and stir between the autumn sown crops. 

Tansy is mostly grown in a spare corner ; it 
luxuriates in a rich soil, and is easily increased 
by division, or seed. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



07 



Tarragon. — Plant in rows fifteen inches 
apart, and six inches in the row ; it is in- 
creased by division, and can be grown on 
common soil. 

Thyme. — A small sowing may be made on 
a warm sandy border, or (if wanted early,) in 
a slight heat ; it is easily- increased by slips or 
layers in March ; the old roots require to be 
often transplanted. 

Turnips are apt to run to seed if sown 
early, and exposed to frost ; therefore sow 
a few in a very gentle heat, under glass, and 
give air freely. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Keep the hoe active 
in dry weather. Finish all pruning, nailing, 
and planting ; fork up the soil where it has 
been trampled down during the operations of 
nailing and pruning. Have all the protect- 
ing materials in readiness. Prepare for graft- 
ing, and preserve grafts of the approved sorts 
by thrusting them half way into the ground 
in a shaded place ; or they will keep well in 
a cellar by being thrust into a potato, or 
among sand. Attend to airing the fruit-room, 
and wiping and cleaning the fruit. 

Almonds — if fruit is expected — will require 
to be protected when in blossom ; they ai e 
often and deservedly kept for ornament only. 

Apples. — Finish the pruning and nailing by 
the end of the month ; stake and mulch trees 
lately transplanted, and water them if dry 
weather prevails. 

Apricots should now be finished, and as the 
blossom buds are observed to swell, it is a good 
time to disblossom, taking away all the weak- 
est and badly placed ; protect before the 
blossoms open; a net doubled and hung before 
the trees is of service in keeping the blossom 
later, as well as in preserving it ; keep the 
flowers and wall quite dry; a coping board, to 
project ten inches or so, is of the utmost ser- 
vice at this season. 

Cherries. — Have the early blossoms pro- 
tected, and thin them where very thick. 

Currants. — Finish early the making of 
plantations, and all pruning. Thin (not cut 
back) the branches of black currant bushes. 

Filberts. — Hoe ; and remove any suckers 
which may be shewing themselves. 

Figs. — Remove a portion of the covering, 
if the weather permits, at the end of the 
month. 

Gooseberries. — Mulch those which have 
been transplanted, with such ' material as 
rotten leaves ; have all thoroughly hoed, but 
do not apply the rake except there be 
rubbish to remove. 

Grafting. — Get the grafting clay and other 
appliances in readiness for this operation, 



which must be done while the buds are dor- 
mant. 

Nectarines. — Have these pruned and nailed 
early : protect by awning or netting, and in 
very severe weather apply heat by the wall 
flues. 

Peaches. — Prune and nail up immediately; 
thin the blossoms, taking off all that which is 
weak and badly placed : protect them, and if 
the coping is not broad enough a temporary 
board may be put up for a month or so, the 
better to resist cold. 

Pears. — Plant, prune, and nail ; keep the 
standards thin and open in the heart ; take 
away all the spare weak blossom and wood ; 
protect the blossom in severe weather. 

Plums. — Complete pruning and nailing.; a 
slight protection when in blossom is neces- 
sary. 

Haspberries. — Those canes which were left 
long in the autumn pruning, should now be 
cut close to the stakes ; dig and manure 
finally for the season. 

Vines. — Can still be planted out ; finish the 
pruning and nailing as early as possible. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Although more air 
will be required than in January, yet equal 
care is requisite to avoid currents, and sudden 
transitions : effect this by opening and shutting 
the ventilators gradually, and place gauze or 
canvass over these openings, particularly at 
the front sashes, to soften, by breaking, the 
rush of air. Always, if possible, use soft or 
rain water, and have it when applied of the 
same temperature as the house. If dull 
weather should predominate, give a little fire 
heat during the day, and air at the same time : 
make the most of the influence of sun heat, by 
shutting up early in the afternoon without re- 
ference to the hour of the day. Keep a steady 
heat a little before, and after, and also while 
the plants are in blossom. Maintain a con- 
genial atmosphere, by keeping every part 
w r atered, excepting when in bloom : avoid 
steaming ; choose rather to follow nature, 
closer. Economize the fuel, and the energies of 
the plants at the same time, by covering at 
night with mats, as far as practicable. 

Asparagus. — Temperature, 60 degrees by 
day ; 50 degrees by night. Admit air more 
freely, by tilting the sashes at the back ; renew 
the linings. Prepare another succession bed, 
the last for the season : the exhausted roots 
are worthless. 

Cherries. — Temperature 50 to 60 degrees by 
day ; 45 degrees by night. Take advantage 
of sun heat, and close early: use fire heat 
during the day, in dull weather ; give a good 
syringing after the fruit is set ; disbud early 
and gradually.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



Cucumbers. — Temperature To to 80 degrees 
by day ; 60 to 65 degrees by night. Syringe, 
gently, those in stoves, at least twice a day, 
occasionally using soot, and liquid manure in 
a clear state : go over them every day, and 
stop and impregnate as required : earth up as 
the rootlets protrude through the soil, using 
equal parts turfy loam and leaf mould of the 
same temperature as that the plants are in. 
Pot off the successional sowings when the seed 
leaves are half an inch broad ; put one or two 
plants in a six-inch pot, planting them rather 
deep, and plunging the pots to the rim in a 
sweet heat. When dung beds are used, have 
the dung well sweetened by often turning be- 
fore it is finally put up ; allow the frame to 
remain close for a day or two, when first put 
on the bed to get up the heat, and after allow- 
ing the rank steam to pass off, form a hillock 
near the back of the frame of the same kind of 
soil as that used for potting ; when this is 
heated to about To degrees, plant out one plant 
to a light, which should have been stopped 
previously ; keep it about ten inches from the 
glass. When trained on a trellis, which is 
every way superior, allow the vine to run to 
six or seven joints before being stopped. Sow 
a few more seeds to meet emergencies. 

Figs. — Temperature 65 degrees by clay; 
55 degrees by night. Disbud moderately ; 
supply liberally with tepid liquid manure ; 
syringe often but mildly, and maintain a moist 
atmosphere ; place those in pots upon a stage 
or pit, where their roots may be allowed to 
run beyond the pots. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature 65 degrees 
by day ; 55 degrees by night. Sow once a 
week, or according to demand ; syringe freely 
with liquid manure : the early plants may be 
put in the early vinery, or pine stove, and 
placed quite near the glass ; the younger 
plants will do best in such situations as the 
peach-house, and should be brought on in suc- 
cession. 

Melons. — Temperature 80 degrees by day ; 
65 by night. Give air every day, if possible, 
by tilting up the upper end of the sashes; this 
is preferable to putting down the sashes, as it 
prevents the draught of air being admitted at 
the bottom : water sparingly. Those in stoves 
or vineries must be syringed in the mornings 
regularly, or if a moist atmosphere can be 
maintained, so as to keep down insects, less 
syringing will do. .Sow a few of the Persian 
sorts ; plant them in heavy loam, well pressed 
together. The Ispahan should not be stopped 
until it has rambled to the extent of the 
frame. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature from 55 degrees 
to 60 degrees ; make up a succession bed with 
well prepared manure ; introduce the spawn, in 
small pieces, six inches apart, when the heat 



is spent to that of new milk : when the heat 
is declining, covering the beds with hay will 
renew it, and render watering the beds, with 
warm water, unnecessary. 

Musas. — Temperature 70 degrees by day ; 
60 degrees by night. Increase the amount of 
moisture in the air, and of water at the roots, 
using it in a tepid state : about once a week 
apply liquid manure. 

Nectarines. — Temperature TO degrees by 
day ; 55 degrees by night. Keep the house 
a little dry when the trees are in blossom ; 
shake them to disperse the pollen, using a 
camel-hair pencil to impregnate the sorts 
which are difficult to set ; fumigate at the 
first appearance of green fly, and shut up with 
a good degree of sun heat. 

Oranges. — Temperature 50 to 55 degrees 
by day ; 45 by night. Give additional, yet 
moderate waterings : have the plants per- 
fectly clean, and shift a few of those which 
most require it, using a strong loamy soil 
mixed with rotten manure. 

Peaches. — Temperature 60 to TO degrees 
by day ; 55 by night ; disblossom as well as 
disbud ; withhold water when in flower ; and 
have the blossoms impregnated ; give a good 
syringing when the fruit is set ; thin the fruit 
when of the size of peas. Fumigate, to destroy 
green fly, and it may require to be repeated ; 
the house should be dry when fumigated, as 
the smoke is apt to do injury when the plants 
are in a wet state. Cover the border outside 
with litter ; stir and rake the soil within to 
sweeten and enrich the whole. Maintain a 
steady heat ; shut up early, permitting the 
thermometer to rise five degrees by sun heat, 
after closing. 

Fine-Apples. — Temperature T5 degrees 
by day ; 65 degrees by night. In dull weather 
keep the fires going, and admit air every day ; 
let the bottom heat range from 90 to 100 de- 
grees ; apply a little liquid manure at the roots, 
giving it very weak at first, and increasing 
both the strength and quantity, as the season 
and the plants advance, until the fruit ceases 
swelling, when it must be gradually withheld. 

Rhubarb. — Temperature, from 60 to 65 de- 
grees. Force now in the open ground by 
placing fermenting material around the boxes 
or pots, with which the plants may be 
covered. 

Salading (as mustard and cress). — Tempe- 
rature from 60 to TO degrees : sow still, a 
little in boxes or pans, in rotten tan, keeping 
it near the glass : it requires no water. 

Seakale. — If fermenting material is scarce 
take up a few roots with good crowns, and put 
them amongst soil in the mushroom-house. 
Give additional covering with leaves or litter 
to the plants out of doors, which will soon be 
ready for use ; it is unimportant that the

crowns be covered with pots, but they must be 
marked with stakes, and care is requisite in 
the uncovering. 

Strawberries. — Temperature from 55 to 60 
degrees by day ; 50 degrees by night. As 
soon as the fruit is set, increase the heat and 
give copious waterings of liquid manure ; tie 
out the fruit stalks to short stakes ; maintain 
a moist atmosphere up to the time of ripening. 
Bring in another succession of plants; start 
them in a cool house, and bring them on gra- 
dually. 

Vinery. — Temperature from 70 to 80 de- 
grees by day j 65 to 70 degrees by night. 
Be careful in admitting air, and let it be only 
at the top ventilators ; nail on canvas at the 
openings, to break the rush of air ; give and 
take away the air by degrees, shutting up with 
sun heat at 85 degrees, Avhen at command. Thin 
the buds, bunches, and shoots, allowing about 
fifteen bunches to an established vine, when 
trained to a single light, but this must be re- 
gulated by the state of the plant, and the space 
it covers. The borders outside must be thickly 
covered with stable litter, and those inside 
watered with the liquid manure. Gently shake 
the bunches when in flower, and withhold water. 
Put in cuttings of single eyes, and plunge the 
pots in heat ; supply those in pots with liquid 
manure liberally. 

THE FLOWER GARDEN AND SHRUBBERY. 

Sow a succession of all hardy and half- 
hardy annuals, towards the end of the month. 

Plant and Transplant plants of every 
kind, if the weather is dry ; the sooner the 
better. 

General Directions. — Complete all altera- 
tions by the end of the month. It is quite 
proper, where expense is no object, to have the 
beds in the flower garden laid down in a new 
form almost every year. Where new lawn is 
being made, it is the readiest way, and the best, 
if turf can be got good, to turf it, instead of 
sowing. Roll and sweep the lawns and walks ; 
also turn the walks, if necessary. These 
should have a gentle rise in the centre, and at 
the sides should be filled up to within an inch 
or so of the level of the verge. Finish prun- 
ing and digging, and nearly the whole of the 
transplanting ; for although this may be done 
next month, it is well for many reasons to 
have it completed as early as possible. Keep 
the hoe going now in every part ; and as the 
season advances, let the whole garden increase 
in neatness and beauty. 

Layering. — All hard-wooded shrubs which 
are difficult to raise by cuttings, can be got by 
layers, thus : — bend down the branches to the 
earth, pin down with pegs, and, usually 
at a bud, say a few inches from the extremity 



of the shoots, make an incision, cutting up- 
wards half an inch ; many tough wooded 
plants do better twisted ; cover the cut, or 
twisted part with soil, and make the shoots 
stand a little erect : some kinds will be two 
seasons in rooting : use some sandy soil for 
rooting in. The present and next month are 
suitable for the operation. 

Transplanting Trees and Shrubs, may be 
done now, though this season is not so good as 
the autumn. Avoid making deep pits for the 
plants ; rather trench the spot, and, at least 
with all choice kinds, plant on or near the 
surface, providing soil to cover the roots ; 
those wdiich have bad roots especially must 
be supported. 

Alpines. — Keep these on a northern aspect ; 
a few might now be planted out upon the 
rock-work, or any suitable romantic spot. 

Anemones. — Loosen the soil about them ; 
the reserved tubers must be put in imme- 
diately. 

Annuals. — The hardy kinds forwarded in 
frames, should be potted in six-inch pots, 
four or five plants in each ; give them plenty 
of air, excepting when fresh potted, when they 
are kept close for a day or two ; use a soil of 
loam, leaf mould, and sand. The half-hardy 
ones, as rhodanthe, mesembryanthemum, schi- 
zanthus, &c, may be sown, giving them a little 
bottom heat, and plenty of light, when they 
vegetate. 

Aquilegias (Columbine). — Plant out single 
plants where they are to bloom, in a rich 
soil. 

Alyssum saxatile. — Those in pots and in 
the reserve garden should be planted out now 
where they are to flower. 

Auriculas. — Divide and plant out the 
border sorts ; re-surface the prize kinds with 
a rich compost of pigeons' and cow-dung well 
decomposed, adding a quantity of river sand ; 
give air by tilting behind ; protect from frost. 

Sox-edgings. — Finish the making and re- 
pairing of edgings, as early as possible ; it 
will do later, but hinders other work in the 
busy season. 

Bidbs. — All those planted early will be the 
better for being slightly protected in severe 
weather ; and those which are yet to plant, 
must be put in immediately. 

Carnations must be kept well aired and 
free from damp, than which nothing is more 
injurious : turn and clean the soil, which is 
laid up for their final shifting, and expose it 
to the frosts. 

Campamdas (Canterbury bells, &c.) — Plant 
in the situations where they are to bloom, if 
not already done ; place them singly, not in 
masses ; a soil of loam and rotten dung suits 
them. 

Clematis and Deciduous Climbers. — Prune, 



70 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



and tie in a few of the strong and best ripened 
shoots. 

Crocus. — Before the different plantings 
come into bloom, stir up the soil afresh. 

Daisies. — Divide and plant for edgings, 
keeping each kind by itself; they look well on 
banks in masses, but must be well watered, 
and have a rich loamy soil. 

Dahlias. — At the end of the month, place 
the choice sorts in heat, putting them in a 
light soil, or lay them in boxes, or together on 
the ground, and sprinkle dry earth over them ; 
look over the old roots, and attempt to save 
any that may be rotting, by putting them in 
heat, to produce cuttings. 

Oentianella. — This makes pretty edgings ; 
divide them now for that purpose : they also 
look well in large patches ; sprinkle a little 
fresh soil below and around them, removing 
some of that which is exhausted. 

Hyacinths. — If frosty, protect with dry 
litter, or mats ; but avoid covering them when 
mild : the finer sorts should have an awn- 
ing. 

Jasmines, Honeysuckles, &c, when struck 
from cuttings or layers should be put in nur- 
sery rows upon a reserve border. 

Laurels, Laurustinus, &c, may now be 
propagated freely from cuttings, putting them 
in thickiy in shallow trenches, a foot apart; 
put a little sand and leaf mould at the bottom. 
To have plants quickly, select a few of the 
under branches where they will not be missed, 
peg them down, and throw a spadeful of soil 
over them ; they will very soon be rooted. 

Mignonette. — Keep that in pots, well aired, 
and near the glass ; have the caterpillars care- 
fully picked off, if they appear. Sow a little 
on a warm border. 

Mimulus, (Musk plant, &c.) — Plant out 
those Avhich have been kept in pots for the 
winter ; and divide the old roots, giving them 
a rich loamy soil. 

Pansies. — Still keep the fine sorts in frames, 
but give air freely ; propagate from the small 
suckers issuing from the old plants : prepare 
new beds for them, with a compost of loam, 
leaf mould, and rotten manure. 

Picotees. — Prepare the soil thoroughly for 
the final shifting, by turning it in frosty 
Aveather, and picking out all the insects ; 
water the plants sparingly, and air plenti- 
fully. 

Pinuses. — Be careful now to 'protect the 
choice specimens planted out, with mats or 
awning, as the young growth is apt to be in- 
jured by frosts. 

Pinks.— °Form and plant new beds, using a 
soil of equal parts loam, leaf mould, and de- 
composed cow-dung ; makeup the deficiencies 
in the old beds, or plant the old plants into 
the borders. 



Polyanthus, Cowslips, &c. — The seed which 
is sown must not get dry ; sprinkle a little 
moss over it : those in pots must have plenty 
of air, and the pots must be plunged, and kept 
near the glass ; the commoner sorts look well 
as edgings. 

Primroses are also suitable edgings ; the 
fine double sorts must be kept in frames, and 
kept from cutting winds and cold. 

Ranunculus. — Plant immediately, if not 
done ; protect the early planted ones from 
heavy rains and severe cold. 

Roses. — "Where the soil is exhausted renew 
it by taking part of the old away and replacing 
it with strong loam and cow-dung. Finally, 
prune a portion of the trees, but allow some 
to stand over until next month to make a suc- 
cession of bloom. 

Saxifraqa uvibrosa ("London Pride) is an 
excellent thing for an edging in shady situa- 
tions, as under trees ; divide and plant them 
four inches apart. 

Stocks. — Pot off those sown last month, and 
the richer the soil the better ; avoid peat 
earth ; put in another sowing ; those in 
frames may be put out under hoops and mats, 
which will gradually harden them, and make 
room for more tender plants. 

Sweet William. — Plant out in masses ; no- 
thing looks richer ; if possible, keep the colours 
distinct ; any ordinary soil will suit them. 

Sweet Peas may, at the end of the month, 
be sown on narrow strips of turf (inverted) 
hollowed out sufficiently to admit of covering 
the seed, or they may be sown in pots or 
boxes ; they must be kept in frames, and if 
they can have a little heat at first, all the 
better. 

Tigridias. — These should be placed in pots 
or boxes, and started in a gentle heat about 
the end of the month. 

Tulips. — Have an awning ready to apply 
in frosty weather, and to protect them from 
heavy rains. 

Violets. — Where these are growing by the 
side of walls or as edgings, they should be 
cleaned carefully, which will considerably im- 
prove their blooming ; in very cold weather 
protect them if flowers are wanted. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

General Directions. — As most of the plants 
now in flower must be obtained from the 
forcing house, they must not be exposed to 
the cold air for some days. Those which 
are being brought on gradually to flower, must 
be often syringed and sponged, doing it in 
the forenoon ; or during a mild shower, they 
may be set out to clean the foliage, which 
invariably gets dusty. In watering invari- 
ably use tepid water. 

Bulbs will be much assisted by being placed

71 



in stands, and surrounded with moss ; this too 
improves their appearance. 

Begonias. — Those started last month, will 
be beginning to grow, and the supply of water 
may be increased. Pot the others in a fresh 
and rich soil, well-drained, but give no water 
until they start. 

Cacti will require no water ; keep them in 
the warmest part of the room, where there is 
light. 

Calceolarias should have a larger pot, and 
rich peaty soil ; they must be kept near the 
light, and have plenty of air ; they are very 
liable to injury from green fly, which should 
be looked to. 

Camellias should now be in full bloom ; 
they require a little more water, but avoid de- 
luging them ; excite them to grow when the 
flowering is past. 

Cinerarias. — Give plenty of air, and keep 
cool ; if the pots are full of roots, give them 
a size larger, using any rich soil ; they are 
very liable to suffer from green fly. 

Cyclamens may be kept in bloom for months. 
C. persicum is odoriferous and easily culti- 
vated ; keep them a little close, and water 
rather sparingly. 

Evergreens, which are most suitable for 
balconies at this season, should have all the 
fading leaves cleared off, and the surface of 
the soil freshened up. 

Geraniums should be kept near the light ; 
they may be set out on fine days, but must be 
taken in again in the afternoon. 

Hyacinths. — Those in glasses may have a 
small piece of charcoal put in the water, which 
keeps it fresh, and prevents the necessity of 
often changing it ; let the water used always 
be rain water : when frosty weather prevails, 
remove the glasses to a warmer part of the 
room : a little guano water is beneficial when 
they are in full growth, but apply it clear and 
weak. 

Myrtles must not have much water ; the 
old soil should be taken away from the roots, 
and fresh added ; or, if necessary, they may 
be potted, using rich loamy soil, well drained. 

Oranges. — Keep these somewhat warm and 
close ; when commencing to grow, surface the 
pot or tub with a mixture of strong yellow 
loam and decomposed cow-dung. 

Hoses. — Pick off all the decayed flowers, 
and shorten the flower shoots very moderately. 
By the end of the month, shift them, using 
rich loamy soil. 

Primula sinensis. — Divest these of all their 
old flower stems, and preserve no seed but 
from the very best sorts ; stir up the soil in 
the pot, and water sparingly ; propagate the 
double flowered ones by dividing them, and 
planting the slips as cuttings. 

Wardian Cases.— The chief element of suc- 



cess in growing plants in these, consists in mak- 
ing a suitable selection, and introducing them at 
the proper season ; next to this, stand arrange- 
ment, and thorough cleanliness. The plants most 
suitable are such as various annuals, cacti, ferns, 
lycopodiums, and orchids, in general avoiding 
very free and rapid growing kinds. The 
best mode of arrangement is, to have in the 
centre a rustic branch reaching to the top of 
the case, and fixed at the bottom ; to this 
branch (or tree in miniature) the orchids may 
be attached. The surface may, throughout, 
have an irregular rocky character, and here 
ferns and lycopodiums may be planted. The 
arrangement of the plants may often be changed, 
so as to give variety. Thunbergias are found 
to do admirably in these cases : sow a few 
now in a hot-bed for that purpose. Cacalias, 
mesembryanthemums, cacti, and similar plants 
do pretty well in small pots, amongst soil con- 
taining lime rubbish well drained. Lycopo- 
diums and ferns, which are perhaps the best 
suited of any, may be increased by taking 
off young plants, and checking them by grow- 
ing them in small pots with little soil ; they 
then do not get large ; the dwarf sorts are 
best ; the rare and beautiful kinds should 
have the most conspicuous places. Lygodium 
scandens does well, and should be allowed to 
ramble amongst the orchids. Orchids should 
consist of the small growers; they must be 
attached to very small blocks, by small wire, 
with a little moss about their roots. The 
sensitive plant which does well, and has much 
interest, should now be sown in a hot-bed, 
preparatory to being placed in the case. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

Alpines. — Give these more water and air : 
the most interesting and pretty, as Saxifraga 
oppositifolia with the primulas, may be taken 
to the green-house while in flower ; continue 
covering at night if the weather is cold ; the 
pots may now be taken out of the material in 
which they are plunged. 

Annuals. — The tender sorts may be sown 
in heat any time this month : pot off into 
small pots those which w r ere sown last month, 
plunge them in bottom heat, and keep them 
near the glass : cover close at night with mats. 
Half-hardy ones may also be sown now, in 
heat — say the middle of the month : shift those 
which have been kept through the winter, 
and keep them neatly staked, giving air slightly 
every day by tilting the sashes behind. 

Half-hardy Plants which have been kept 
for bedding out, as verbenas, fuchsias, pelar- 
goniums, &c, may, if in cutting pots, be 
shifted singly into small pots, and those now 
in the small pots, may be shifted to the next 
size, keeping the frames close after, for a day 
or so. The choicer sorts should be propa- 



72 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



gated from as much as to secure a sufficient 
stock, putting them in silver sand, and giving 
them a little bottom lieat. 

Violets in frames, must have plenty of air 
and light, and moderate supplies of water. 

Hardy Perennials, as pentstemons, campa- 
nulas, &c, kept in frames, should be planted 
out near the end of the month ; cuttings of all 
these may be put in now, and will produce 
plants to flower in autumn. 

Forcing Pit. — Continue to keep this filled 
up, as the plants are successionally taken away 
for the show-house. The various bulbs, as 
ainaryllids, hyacinths, narcissus, iris, oxalis, 
sparaxis, anemones, gladiolus, &c, may all be 
made serviceable now : it is an advantage to 
have the pots well filled with roots previous 
to their being put in the heat. Protect the 
bulbs plunged out of doors from the rains and 
frost, and let them be excited gradually when 
wanted. The other forcing plants will chiefly 
consist of lilacs, deutzias, azaleas, rhododen- 
drons, kalmias, &c. ; also, lily of the valley, 
geraniums, pinks, carnations, roses, &c. &c, 
most of which would be all the better for 
slight bottom heat. Keep a moist atmo- 
sphere ; syringe with tobacco water, or fumi- 
gate at the first sight of aphis or green fly. 
The heat of the house or pit may range from 
50 to 60 degrees at night, and from 60 to 75 
by day, closing up early with sun heat. The 
whole of* the plants will be bettered by apply- 
ing weak liquid manure when growing. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 40 to 50 degrees by 
day, and 35 to 40 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — In mild weather give air 
plentifully ; no artificial heat will be required 
to dry up damp, unless it be very dull wea- 
ther ; continue to use artificial coverings at 
night in cold weather, and only when very 
severe apply fire heat. 

Watering. — A little more moisture will now 
be requisite : look over the individual plants 
every day ; and in watering give as much as 
will go to the bottom of the pot, otherwise the 
plants will be liable to suffer when not 
expected. The water must be of the same 
temperature as the house. 

Potting. — If any of the pots have before 
been in use, have them all washed and tho- 
roughly dried. Begin to shift those plants 
which are vigorous growers, and in the most 
forward state : drain well, and cover the 
drainage by a little moss or turf to prevent 
the soil mixing with the crocks : when the 
roots are matted, they must be carefully 
loosened, and the ball of earth pierced to 
admit water. The utmost care is requisite to 
have the soil filled into every crevice around 
the ball, which should be set so deep in the 



pot as will admit of being just covered in 
shifting. 

Soils. — If possible have all the different 
kinds protected from the rains. Turn com- 
posts in frosty weather : that most generally 
useful is a mixture of turfy loam, leaf mould, 
and peat earth in equal parts, with a little 
decomposed cow-dung and silver sand added ; 
this will suit all soft-wooded plants, as pe- 
largoniums, fuchsias, salvias, &c. Epacris, 
heaths, and the hard -wooded things generally 
require a soil composed chiefly of sandy peat 
in a turfy state, adding in the case of aza- 
leas, and such plants, a little leaf mould. 

Top dressing. — Those plants which from 
want of accommodation and other causes may 
not be shifted, must have all the old soil taken 
away as far as the roots will allow, and re- 
placed by fresh soil of a somewhat richer 
nature than the plant usually requires when 
shifted, but of the same character. 

Insects. — Fumigate, or syringe with tobacco 
water, at the first appearance of green fly. 
To prevent spotting or dirtying the plants 
with the tobacco liquid, syringe them first with 
clean water. 

Aloes, and succulents generally, will require 
but little water ; on the appearance of growth 
give rather more. 

Agaves, and large succulents, may be shifted 
at the end of the month, and excited into 
growth ; they require a rich soil and a perfect 
drainage. Sponge over the leaves, which are 
apt to get dusty : give them plenty of air. 

Ahtromerias. — Give these a little tepid 
water as they advance, and when mild admit 
plenty of air to them, but avoid currents. 

Amaryllis. — Pot a few more for succes- 
sion : many of them require stove treatment, 
and all are the better for a little warmth : 
those potted early must have additional 
water ; and those in flower should be kept 
cooler. 

Annuals. — Sow a few in pots such as schi- 
zanthus, viscaria, phlox, lobelia, and other 
showy kinds, giving them a slight bottom 
heat : transplant them into small pots as soon 
as they are fairly grown ; keep them near the 
glass, where they may get plenty of air in 
mild weather. 

Azaleas. — Take a few more into heat for 
succession, and keep the remainder as back- 
ward as possible, by placing them in a cold 
shady situation. Those past bloom should be 
shifted and taken into the stove or vinery, 
where they will be excited into growth, and 
matured for early forcing : they should have 
peat soil, with a little leaf mould when shifted. 

Calceolarias. — If large specimens are 
wanted, give them a shift as often as the roots 
touch the sides of the pots : prevent damage 
from slugs and green fly, from both of which 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



73 



they are liable to suffer. Keep the plants 
near the glass, and air regularly to prevent 
them drawing. Use a good deal of turfy 
peat when potting, and water moderately. 

Camellias. — Those plants which are past 
bloom should be shifted, (giving them a soil 
of loam and peat, equal parts,) and put into a 
warm place, such as the pit in a vinery. 
Shift only those which require it, as many do 
well to be shifted only onee in two or three 
seasons. 

Cape Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c, if 
required early, may be forwarded by being 
placed in a gentle heat ; the general stock will 
do best in a cold frame protected from frosts, 
or in a greenhouse on shelves near the glass. 

Cephalotus folliadaris (New Holland 
Pitcher plant). — Increase the heat and mois- 
ture as the days lengthen ; and plant a few 
pieces of lycopodium around the edge of the 
pot, which must be kept growing and clipped. 

Cinerarias. — Keep always cool, and give 
plenty of pot room to the larger specimens : 
those wanted to flower early should be con- 
fined to small pots, and watered with liquid 
manure when forming their flower buds ; use 
tepid water. 

Chrysanthemums. — Place these in an open 
and cool place, just free from frost, giving 
them a little water. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, should be 
kept at the warm end of the greenhouse : 
give them a small shift into a soil of peat 
loam and leaf mould, equal parts, adding a 
little silver sand. The heads of the young 
plants will be much improved by thinning out 
the weak shoots. 

Cyclamens. — The seedlings should be grown 
freely in the coolest part of the stove : the old 
plants may be kept in the warmest part of the 
greenhouse, and must be regularly watered. 

Epacris. — Those whose bloom is past 
should be well shortened back, and when 
again started to grow, shifted into larger pots 
in a soil of sandy peat and a little leaf mould ; 
they will require very little water. Keep the 
late sorts very cool, to prolong the flowering. 

Fuchsias. — Shift the early started ones 
into a good sized pot, using equal parts of 
loam, leaf mould, and decomposed manure, 
with a little sand : thin out the irregular and 
over crowded shoots, and where the branches 
are scanty, stop the young shoots ; train 
mostly with one leading stem. Cuttings will 
now strike readily in a little bottom heat ; 
do not top the cuttings. 

Gompholobiums, and other tender creepers, 
must be kept regularly tied in ; it is not advi- 
sable to tie too early, as the young shoots get 
deformed ; allow them to ramble a little and 
thin the weak shoots. 

Haivorthias. — Keep these rather dry ; stir 



up the soil and renew the surface : a thin 
layer of white sand on the surface looks neat. 

Leschenaultias. — Put these where they will 
have plenty of light, and no confined damp, 
such as on one of the high shelves : tie down 
the shoots so as to form handsome bushes. 

Lilium japonicum. — Keep still in a cool 
frame ; air freely, but free them from any 
cold winds. Water must be increased as they 
advance in growth. 

Mignonette. — Set the pots in a light and 
dry part of the house, and water carefully. If 
successional plants are scarce, the same end may 
be attained by stopping a few of the plants. 

New Holland Plants, as acacia, hovea, &c, 
should successionally be brought into bloom 
by aid of a little extra heat : give them more 
water and stop any strong rank shoots, so as 
to balance the plants : shift those past flower- 
ing, using a soil of peat and loam, with sand. 

Oranges. — Shift those requiring it into a 
soil of strong loam : thin out the shoots of 
those lately cut back ; and the shabby look- 
ing plants should now be cut in, and put 
where they will get a little at the roots, as 
well as the branches. 

Oxalis. — Keep these at the warm end, and 
in a moist atmosphere ; the late ones may be 
kept in a cool frame. 

Pelargoniums. — Persevere in covering up 
at night, if the weather is cold. Shift those 
wanted to bloom in June and July without 
delay ; the soil must be one half loam, the 
remainder equal parts of decomposed cow- 
dung, leaf mould, and silver sand ; continue 
airing regularly. Those for blooming early 
should remain unshifted, and must be kept well 
watered, using a little liquid manure occa- 
sionally. The young plants kept in store 
pots must now be potted singly ; they should 
be stopped, aud then allow their leading 
shoots to grow, which when at the third joint 
must be stopped again ; these will make fine 
plants to bloom in autumn. 

Primulas. — Give larger supplies of water; 
save the seed of the improved sorts, and keep 
all free of dead leaves, and such of the seed 
pods as are not wanted. 

Proteas, Banhsias, and Dryandras, must 
have plenty of air, and rather more water. 
When potted, which should be done with care, 
give them free loam with a little sandy peat. 

Rhododendrons. — Remove those in bloom 
to the conservator)'' ; those which are past, 
put in a house where they will get a little 
heat to cause them to grow, and ripen their 
buds early ; bring on the others gradually. 
Plants from the open ground may be lifted 
for forcing. 

Roses. — Those for early bloom must have 
a little heat ; fumigate at the first appearance 
of green fly. 



74 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



Salvias. — Keep those cool which will be 
wanted for late blooming : the young plants 
must bekept growing, and shifted into rich soil. 

Stapelias. — Allow these to remain un wa- 
tered except in dry weather, when they 
should have a little. 

Tropwolums. — Look over these every clay, 
and give a proper direction to the young 
shoots, so as to have the trellis equally covered 
all over : they must be freely but carefully 
watered. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature. — From 50 to 60 degrees by 
day, and 45 degrees at night ; 5 degrees over 
or under will not materially alfect the plants. 

Ventilation. — Admit air chiefly at the top, 
and more freely, but avoid currents ; if 
admitted at the front, let it not be by opening 
the sashes directly opposite those open at the top. 

Watering . — Keep all the plants near the 
pipes or flues, (and indeed where there is any 
heat,) well supplied, as they are liable to 
suffer from drought. The plants will gene- 
rally require additional water ; but it must be 
of the same temperature as the house. Those 
which are planted out, may have a second 
watering, about the middle of the month. 
Examine the soil six inches down, and ascer- 
tain its real state. 

Arrangement. — Continue to re-arrange the 
plants once a week ; remove the flowering 
plants as they get shabby to their respective 
departments to be shifted, and put into heat to 
make wood and buds for the following season. 

Insects. — Those plants which are planted 
out, must, when infested, be syringed with 
tobacco liquor a good deal reduced, taking 
care first to have the plant syringed with pure 
water. Those in pots, as roses, cinerarias, 
&c, should be put into a close pit and fumi- 
gated. The scale and mealy bug must be got 
rid of if possible ; syringing with very warm 
water will generally kill the latter, and brush- 
ing with soot and soap water will remove the 
former. 

Soils. — Those plants which grew strongly 
last year, may have exhausted the soil ; it will 
be well therefore that those which are vigo- 
rous growers should be looked at, and the 
exhausted soil removed, and replaced by some 
of better quality, according to the nature of 
the plant. 

Routine. — Remove all decayed leaves and 
the fading blooms, and sweep out every 
morning, taking care to damp the floor first, 
to prevent dust arising. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature. — From 60 to 70 degrees by 
day ; and i'rom 55 to 60 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Admit air increasingly, but 
still with caution ; shut up early, and allow 



the temperature to rise to 75 degrees with sun 
heat. 

Water. — The amount of water may also be 
slightly increased, yet it must be given very 
moderately to plants recently shifted ; give 
slight syringings in the morning if the weather 
is bright, and maintain a moist atmosphere. 

Potting. — Look over the whole carefully ; 
and re-pot those whose pots are well filled 
with roots, also those which have imperfect 
drainage and sour unhealthy soil ; keep them 
close for a few days after shifting. All soft- 
wooded plants, as clerdendrons, salvias, &c, 
require a richer soil and larger shifts than such 
as ixoras, and the hard-wooded plants. 

Soils. — It is a common practice to have all 
soils mixed up and exposed to the influence 
of frosts, &c. ; but if the soil is under cover, 
it is immaterial whether or not it is previously 
mixed. 

Insects. — If possible check them at their 
first appearance, and prevent their increase as 
much as possible by sponging over with clean 
water the foliage of those plants which are dusty. 

Achimenes. — Put a few of the store pots, 
(which will be full of tubers) into heat, and 
pot the young plants when grown about an 
inch long ; put them into various sized pots, 
pans, or baskets ; for large specimens plant 
eight or ten tubers in a patch, somewhat 
near together in the centre of the pot ; water 
sparingly at first. 

Allamanda, Beawnontia, and the strong 
growing creepers, should, if necessary, be 
shifted into a soil of equal parts peat and loam, 
adding a little sand and leaf mould ; those 
which are to be trained on a trellis, should 
have them immediately applied. 

Alpinias, Sedijchiums, and other reedy 
plants now in a growing state, will require to 
be shifted ; give them a little bottom heat, 
and as they advance in growth, increase the 
supply of water. 

Aphelandras, Justicias, Muellias, &c. — 
Many of these being now past bloom, can be 
cut partially back, and increased by cuttings ; 
those kept for later flowering may be shifted 
into larger pots, or they can be improved by 
applying a little weak liquid manure twice a 
week. Pot off" the cuttings put in last month, 
and when the roots touch the sides of the 
pots, top them to make them bushy plants. 

Begonias. — Towards the end of the month, 
the full stock of the tuberous rooted sorts may 
be shaken out and repotted in a light but rich 
soil, and placed where they will have a gentle 
bottom heat. A few of the herbaceous and 
shrubby sorts may be excited, but others must 
remain for a while in a state of rest, receiving 
very little water. 

Burckellias. — Put afew of those which have 
been kept cool, into heat, and keep them moist. 



GARDENING CALENDAR F(5R FEBRUARY. 



Cacti. — Excite these gradually and in suc- 
cession. Shift those which require it, hut 
they will bloom more freely if rather stinted : 
at the same time, to have good specimens they 
must be shifted and put in a rich soil. Where 
grafts have been put on, keep the moss 
around them in a damp state, until they are 
united. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — The 
healthy plants with pots full of roots may be 
shifted into larger pots, and may have a little 
bottom heat, and be kept close for a few days : 
if not healthy, re-pot them into the same size 
or a smaller pot, using a turfy open compost 
of equal parts peat and loam, and also give 
them a little bottom heat. 

Clerodendrons. — Cut down the old stems 
to three or four eyes ; shake away the old 
soil, and pot them anew in fresh and rich soil. 
Seedlings from autumn sown seed, should be 
potted off. They must all have plenty of heat, 
light, and room, and a moist atmosphere. 

Climbers. — These must be well cleaned, 
pruned, and neatly tied in ; the young shoots 
are not the better for being tied in too early. 

Daturas. — Excite a few of the rested 
plants, and propagate from the single eyes ; 
or pot cuttings of two or three eyes each, 
singly, in four-inch pots ; if placed in heat 
they will soon root, and may then be shifted 
on. 

Erythrina. — Thin out the shoots of those 
started early to three or four : the thinnings 
make excellent cuttings, when a few inches 
long ; bring more plants into heat, and train 
some with a single stem. 

Euphorbias. — Remove those in flower to 
the cool end of the house, where they will 
retain their bloom much longer. Propagate 
young plants of E.fulgens, and keep them 
dwarf and bushy, by stopping them in due 
time. 

Ferns may now be looked over and many 
will require shifting: use a soil of loam and 
leaf mould, with a little peat and sand ; they 
require a humid close atmosphere. Sow 
the seeds (spores) under a bell glass, scatter- 
ing them over rough lumps of peat soil, and 
set the pots in feeders of water ; they will re- 
quire no other watering nor covering. The 
water fern ( Ellebocarpus oleraceus) must be 
kept very moist : it is best raised from seeds 
annually. 

Gardenias. — Put a few into a pit where 
there is a good bottom heat ; they must not 
have much water, and the atmosphere must 
be kept moist and congenial. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Those started 
early must have a shift, shaking away all the 
exhausted soil; place a few more in heat : those 
in a resting state must not be allowed to suffer 
from cold or damp. 



Uippeastrums, Crinums, and Pancratiums. 
— Those showing signs of growth should be 
re-potted in fresh soil, and put in a warm and 
light place : allow those which are resting to 
get a little dry gradually. 

Hydrangeas. — Supply largely with water, 
also liquid manure twice a week ; bring in a 
few more plants for succession. 

Ipomoeas. — Sow the seeds in a hot bed, to 
be potted off early : give the established plants 
a slight pruning. 

Ixoras. — Plunge in a dung or bark bed 
near the glass. When the pot is nigh filled 
with roots, shift them, using a soil of three 
parts peat, and one of loam, with a little silver 
sand. 

Jasmines, Rondeletias, Brunfelsias, &c, in 
a flowering state, should have good supplies 
of water : thin and tie out the shoots of those 
wanted for specimens. 

Lantanas will require very little water : 
those beginning to grow will furnish cuttings 
for propagation, and these will make fine 
plants ; or they are useful for bedding out for 
flowering in autumn, and may be treated pre- 
cisely as verbenas, only they require peat, 
or bog mould. 

Luculia gratissima. — Those struck last 
month should be potted as early as possible 
into a soil of loam, leaf mould, and sandy peat : 
continue to propagate young plants if re- 
quired. 

Lycopodium. — Give these plenty of mois- 
ture ; put the finer sorts in a light situation. 
It is a good plan to prevent their suffering 
from accumulated damp, to plant them in a 
pot inverted within another, the inverted one 
being filled previously with soil and potsherds, 
and the hole at the bottom so enlarged, as to 
leave room to insert the plant ; in this case, a 
few plants may also be inserted around the 
edge of the outside pot : this plan may be 
adopted to produce a large mass in a short 
time. 

Mahaceous plants. — Sow more seeds of 
the annual kinds of hibiscus ; pot off those sown 
last month. The shrubby sorts must be dressed, 
potted, and plunged in the hot-bed ; others 
may do without plunging. 

JSIanettias and other tender climbers must 
be carefully watered ; shift them into fresh 
soil as they show signs of growth, and provide 
trellis and stakes of sufficient size. 

3'Ielastomas. — The late shifted ones must 
be kept growing, and moderately watered at 
first : the others may be shifted at the end of 
the month. 

Melo-Cacti must still be kept moderately 
dry : those most forward, may be shifted to- 
wards the end of the month into a soil of sandy 
loam, brick rubbish, and a little leaf mould. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher plants.) — These may

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR FEBRUARY. 



now be kept more moist, the pots may stand 
in water. Plant lycopodiurus around the pot, 
they give the plant a more lively appearance. 

jSeriums must still be kept very cool ; the 
green-house will suit them ; but when wanted 
to grow, they must be put in heat, and have 
plenty of water as they advance in growth. 

Nympk&as (Water-lilies) and other large 
aquatics delight in a rich loamy soil, and 
should now be shifted : increase the heat, and 
fill up the tanks, applying tepid water ; keep 
them clean, and the pot in which they grow 
always covered with water. 

Palms. — Increase the temperature and 
moisture ; syringe frequently, taking care to 
apply the water as gently as a fine shower, 
and of the same temperature as the house. 

Polia?ithes (Tuberose). — Keep in a gentle 
bottom heat, giving no water until they show 
signs of growth. 

Thunbergias. — Pot off those sown last 
month ; and when they commence to run, 
have them staked ; shift the old plants, and 
have the trellises or stakes put to them early ; 
sow a few more seeds this month ; these re- 
quire a moist atmosphere. 

Vincas. — The old plants should have fresh 
soil composed of peat and leaf mould, adding 
a little loam and sand; give them a little bot- 
tom heat, and when in vigorous growth, top 
the shoots to produce a uniform head. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm or Indian house 
from 60 to 70 degrees by day ; 55 to 60 de- 
grees at night. The cool or Mexican house 
from 5 to 10 degrees lower. In dull w r eather, 
the lowest temperature should be adopted, 
and when sunny, the highest. 

Ventilation. — The sashes need not be opened 
except in very sunny weather, and then a 
little in the forenoon : cover up at night with 
mats, and should the weather prove stormy, 
the sides of the house may be kept covered 
until April. 

Watering. — Those which are to be shifted 
must be allowed to get rather dry ; indeed 
little or no water at the roots will be required ; 
increase the moisture as the light and heat 
advance, and syringe occasionally. 

Insects. — It is always necessary to take j 
means to destroy these, and the most effectual 
means should be resorted to on their first ap- 
pearance : if possible, check them instantly, 
and it will greatly facilitate this to go round 
with a candle at night, so as to observe their 
movements ; they are particularly injurious to 
the young growing shoots at this season of 
the year. 

Potting. — Those which are showing signs 
of growth, may be shifted. It is usual when 
using the common pots, to half fill them with 



drainage, and also to mix with the material 
used as soil, pieces of broken brick or char- 
coal. Those on blocks, and in baskets, must 
also be shifted by placing them on and in 
others of larger dimensions. 

Form of Baskets. — The best is that of an 
irregular round outline, made of any crooked 
and knotty rcood, as the oak, though both the 
square and the inverted cone forms, as well 
as the wire baskets, may be sometimes em- 
ployed. The former are as yet little known, 
and less in use, but they have a more natural 
appearance, and are so much the more beauti- 
ful. It is necessary, whatever material be 
used, to see that it is quite clean, and the prac- 
tice of charring the blocks and boiling the 
knotty chats before using, is commendable in 
this light. The bamboo cane is excellent for 
making baskets, for its durability ; and cork 
and willow blocks are recommended. In cer- 
tain situations, perhaps a large rustic branch 
might be introduced ; and those which delight 
on blocks, as the phalamopsis, might be con- 
veniently placed upon it. 

Plants in Flower. — Although these plants 
will retain their bloom much longer in a cool 
atmosphere, they must not be allowed to re- 
main any longer than is compatible with the 
future welfare of the plant : after the bloom 
is past, they must be dressed, and again re- 
turned to their place of growth, taking care 
to place them in a coolish situation at first, 
and inure them again by degrees. 

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES. 

Weeds. — No weeds should be suffered to 
grow either on the cultivated ground, the 
walks, or the spare corners of the garden, nor 
yet in the soil along with potted plants ; 
they should be hoed or pulled up, as the case 
may be, as soon as they appear. Above all, 
they should never be suffered to perfect and 
shed their seeds. The roots of perennial weeds 
should be thoroughly extracted, for in most 
instances, every little scrap left will grow, 
and thus the evil would become aggravated 
by imperfectly removing them. Always re- 
member, that where weeds appear among cul- 
tivated plants, they are robbing them ; if they 
grow on the walks, their appearance is un- 
tidy : if they are allowed to flourish in spare, 
out-of-the-way corners, they are likely thence 
to become disseminated over the whole garden. 

Tke genuineness of seeds is a matter of great 
importance to all garden cultivators : spurious 
seeds are neither so productive as genuine 
ones of good kinds, nor can the regular seasons 
of the crops be so well depended on. It is always 
most profitable to grow the best varieties of 
every kind of vegetable fruit or flower, and to 
pay a fair price for good articles, which are 
generally to be had of respectable dealers. 



CONIFER-E. TEE PINTJS, Oil PINE TREE. 



77 




CONIFER^.— The Pinus, or Pine Tree. 



Pinus, Linnceus (the Pine). — The deriva- 
tion of this name is doubtful ; probably from 
the Greek root pion, signifying fatty matter, 
the trees furnishing the pitch, tar, &c., of com- 
merce ; or, as Dr. Theis thinks, from the 
Celtic pin or pen, a mountain or rock, whence 
the little Apennines, the Pennine Alps, &c. 
The Gallic pinwidden means a mountain tree, 
and this may certainly be considered as a good 
basis for the generic name. 

* Leaves in pairs. 
a. Scales of cones truncate at apex or 
blunt at summit. 

Pinus sylvestris, Linnaeus (wood Pine, or 
Scotch Fir). — This species has two leaves 
in each sheath, but in the young plant the 
leaves come out singly. When full grown, 
they are from two to three inches in length, 
of a light bluish-green colour, concave or 
hollow in the centre of the upper side, and of 
course the reverse on the under. The buds 
are about half an inch long, bluntly pointed, of 
a brown-red colour, but, in some instances. 
whitened with resin. Flowers erect, the 
males aggregate, sulphur coloured, and soon 
surmounted by a branch : females solitary, of 
a purple and green colour. Cones, when full 
grown, from two to three inches in length, of 
a deep green, but when exposed to frost they 
become white. The seeds are brown and 
dark-coloured. A native of the elevated 
northern districts of Scotland, where it attains 
an age of 500 years, or more. 

As this Pine forms the most valuable tree 
to mankind throughout Britain, it demands a 



longer notice and description than the others. 
The species enjoys a wide geographical range, 
growing almost everywhere, being found in 
abundance throughout Europe, Asia, and 
America, crowning the heights, and filling 
the valleys, in every description of clime, 
losing and retaining its vigorous appearance, 
according to the situation which it may happen 
to affect, yet admirably bearing out its cha- 
racter of being a true denizen of the world. 
But though thus widely scattered over the 
face of the earth, its proper seat is on the 
mountains vast and rude. This; is certainly 
nature's distribution of the species, and though 
it may grow on the hot savannahs of India, it 
is as much out of its element in such situa- 
tions, as the osier is when placed on the bleak 
hill-top. In warm countries, where the tem- 
perature rises above a certain degree, the 
compound of the juices becomes deranged, 
and the oil which pervades its bark, flies off in 
the shape of vapour. All such timber, there- 
fore, is deficient in hardness and durability ; 
a fact which may be tested even in this 
country by any one who has plantations on 
two sides of a hill, the timber on the southern 
exposure being rather softer than that pro- 
duced on the northern side. 

Properly speaking, this pine has no com- 
munion whatever with other trees having 
broad leaves. In a state of nature, it is found 
alone, delighting in light sandy places, with 
dry shattery bottoms, or even in a substratum 
of rock. Viewed in such a situation, the tree 
is a tall, towering object, not soon dying down, 
and affording the best of timber. 



CONIEERiE. — THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



The varieties of this tree are very numer- 5 
ous, but few of them are worth much notice 
except P. sylvcstris horizontals, or the red- 
wooded Highland Pine of Scotland, which is 
infinitely more valuable than the species itself. 
It is at once distinguished from the common 
tree by its smooth and red bark ; by its 
suddenly diverging into innumerable thick 
branches like the Cedar of Lebanon ; and in 
old age somewhat resembling the bold and 
rigid figure of the oak. The safest criterion, 
however, by which we can judge of the 
variety is by the cones. " By their fruit ye 
shall know them." The appearance and 
length of the spicula leading to a distinction, 
is deceitful, and ought to be looked upon with 
considerable caution. The cones of the true 
Highland Pine are much smaller and rounder 
than those of the common tree, having, when 
compared with the others, an appearance of 
stuntedness, as if the tree which bore them 
had been in ill health all the summer. The 
trees of the variety do not bear one-fourth of 
the quantity of cones found on the species ; 
and hence it is that nurserymen go on propa- 
gating that kind which they can the more 
readily procure. There is every reason to 
believe that the red-wooded tree is the 
original and true Scotch Pine, but as the 
other one bears seed in such quantities it has 
been, in most cases, resorted to, because, as 
already observed, the cones can be had at a 
much cheaper rate. 

It would be difficult to say too much in re- 
commending the hard-wooded tree in prefer- 
ence to the common soft-wooded variety, 
which, compared with the other, is but a 
worthless castaway. It will be readily ad- 
mitted that in the ordinary branches of hus- 
bandry, it is of great importance to lay down 
even an annual crop with seed of a pure 
variety and kind, which has not become in 
any respect degenerate. Of how much greater 
consequence is it, therefore, to exercise every 
care in securing the genuineness of a crop 
destined for the growth of fifty, or perhaps a 
hundred years. In the northern parts of 
Scotland, the timber of the Highland Pine, 
when situated near shipping places, is fre- 
quently sold in large quantities at from Is. 6d. 
to Is. 8d., whilst that of the common variety 
fetches at most from 6d. to lOd. a cubic-foot — 
the best of all proofs of the preference it com- 
mands in that quarter, and its great superio- 
rity over the other as a timber tree. 

Keeping the better variety in view, there- 
fore, the properties and uses of the species are 
exceedingly numerous. The timber shipped 
at the ports of Riga, Dantzic, Memel, and 
Petersburg, are chiefly of the Scotch Pine. 
The longest and best masts received from 
those ports are of the same tree. An immense 



majority of the deals and joists used in house 
carpentry, are also of this description of wood ; 
and it would be difficult indeed to select any 
piece of work, where wood is required, where 
this species of timber is not to be found. It 
is used as posts and rails for fencing, in the 
manufacture of agricultural implements, in 
raising out-buildings, for ladders, scaffolding, 
doors, windows, tables, and chairs. Without 
it, rural and domestic comforts and conve- 
niences would have been a century behind the 
almost perfect state in which we find them in 
the present day. For fuel, the wood of this 
tree is eminently suited. In this respect it has 
been, and is, a great ameliorator of the cold and 
wintry north, shedding a happy gleam around 
the fire-side of many a mountaineer. It is also 
used extensively in its living state, to abate 
the severity of the climate, experienced in 
elevated districts throughout Britain, either 
by planting it alone in the shape of a hedge or 
fence, or by placing it in belts or strips. Its 
resinous products must not be forgotten. 
These are turpentine, tar, and pitch. The 
roots of this tree, after being thoroughly dried, 
are split up into thin pieces resembling laths, 
which are used by the Highlanders of Scot- 
land instead of candles. They afford a toler- 
able light, but require almost constant atten- 
tion. 

Many writers on trees have set down this 
pine as a sombre, uninteresting object, devoid 
of all merit as an ornamental plant, and fit 
only for the recesses of the forest. Unluckily, 
a great many of those who have published 
treatises on trees have been sadly deficient in 
the imaginative, and have had, in reality, no 
eye for anything akin to the picturesque. 
The truth is, several of them have risen from 
that class who have been accustomed all their 
lives, hatchet in hand, to cut up brushwood, as 
it is called, which is nothing more or less than 
the pine, — that pine which has been noticed 
in undying strains by Virgil, Ovid, Horace, 
Statius, Catullus, and all the masters of anti- 
quity, — so that by force of habit our modern 
men of taste have been led to associate it with 
all that is mean and common. We forgive 
them. Viewed on its native hills, there is an 
air of grandeur and antiquity, a solemn and 
solitary beauty about this species of pine, that 
renders it, perhaps, the most picturesque of 
any of the cone-bearing tribe. In spring-time, 
it is true, it does not appear in the gay dra- 
pery of the birch, or in the soft apparel of the 
poplar, but as a grand and striking object, it 
has its worshippers, dingy and funereal though 
it be called. To have a right estimate of its 
character, however, it must be seen holding 
converse with the storm on the solitary heights 
of Braemar, Abernethy, and Cairngorm — the 
Lebanons of our island — where it has grown 



CONIFER/E. — THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE.

in an unbroken line of succession since the 
days of the flood. 

The Scotch pine is always raised from seeds. 
The cones which contain them are gathered 
about Christmas time, after the frost has ope- 
rated upon them so as to change their colour 
to a greyish white, when they are said to be 
ripe ; for if collected when green, they will 
not open without being subjected to a degree 
of heat which would destroy the vegetative 
power of the seeds. The safest way of treat- 
ing the cones is to expose them to the heat of 
the sun ; but where large quantities are re- 
quired this plan is tedious in the extreme. 
Those who collect cones in order to supply 
others with seeds, invariably place the cones 
upon a kiln, and subject them to a gentle fire, 
turning over the cones several times in a day, 
until they have all expanded. A great pro- 
portion of the seeds will fall out, and what 
remain in the cones may be separated from 
them by sifting with a wide sieve. They 
should then be spread about six inches deep 
upon an uneven clay floor, and rubbed with 
the feet until the wings are detached. After 
this they should be subjected to the usual 
cleaning process, as is done with other seeds, 
and kept in a dry loft till required. The time 
for sowing the seeds is the middle of April ; 
and in order to insure a full, close crop, a free 
sandy loam should be selected on which to sow 
them. Many crops of this tree are entirely 
ruined by being sown in soil which gets 
crusted or baked by sunshine, because the 
tender sprouts cannot penetrate through the 
surface usually formed on retentive ground. 
The depth of covering required for these 
seeds is about quarter of an inch ; but on 
particularly light land it may be safely in- 
creased to half an inch. In the seed-beds, 
the plants should remain eighteen months, 
when they should be transplanted (in the 
month of October) into nursery lines nine 
inches apart from each other, and the plants 
in the lines about two inches apart. Nursery- 
men, it is true, place the plants much closer 
than is here recommended, but when so 
treated, they are often found deficient in those 
side branches which are both useful and orna- 
mental, and which give that stochiness so 
requisite to plants when placed in exposed 
situations. They may remain in the lines 
either one or two years, but it will be always 
found advisable to plant them out where they 
are intended to remain the year after they 
have been removed in the nursery, the roots 
being then a thick mass of fine fibres. 

The mode of planting this pine will depend 
entirely upon circumstances. For this tree, 
it is quite impracticable, as it is unnecessary, 
to attempt trenching or ploughing up large 
tracts of waste land, as some arboricultural 



writers have recommended. In all cases, 
where the heath does not exceed five or six 
inches, the plants may be at once inserted 
with a miniature spade, or j)lo<nting iron, as it 
is called, placing the plants at about four feet 
apart from each other. Rank furze, broom, 
&c., must be uprooted ; and in cases where 
the heath is tall, it should be burned a few 
years previous to planting. If the peat soil 
on the surface of the land is more than four 
inches thick, the plants will succeed but indif- 
ferently. It is, therefore, advisable that a 
labourer, with a mattock, should precede the 
planter, skimming off the peat with one end ; 
and bringing up the subsoil with the other. 
The best time to plant the Scotch pine is in 
the month of September, because then the 
young trees furnish themselves with roots in 
their new situation before the winter comes 
on. This fact admits of no dispute. 

The after management of a pine wood is 
one of the nicest operations which the forester 
has to think of. On the one hand, you have 
the delicately organized structure, beautifully 
furnished on all sides with branches and leaves, 
which are the life agents of the tree. On the 
other hand, you know that the timber-mer- 
chant cares not for branches, and that he must 
have a clear, clean, trunk. The plan, there- 
fore, is to plant the trees so close to one an- 
other that their proximity will discourage and 
prevent any strong lateral branches, whilst the 
removal of the weak ones can have no hurtful 
effect upon the timber. Yet, again, air and 
light must be admitted to the boles, else the 
wood will be soft and spongy. Such are the 
considerations to which the attention of every 
enlightened planter should be directed. 

The age at which the Scotch pine should be 
felled will be best determined by the nature of 
the soil on which it grows. If exceedingly 
poor, and retentive of water, the trees will 
attain their largest size in twenty-five years. 
This species of soil, which is indicated by a 
very thin crust of peat on a layer of red sand, 
or iron stone, and bearing only sickly patches 
of heath, with here and there pools of water, 
will not bear wood profitably of a greater age 
than stated above. On good land, such as 
valleys and slopes of hills, where the roots 
have free access to the subsoil, the tree will 
attain maturity in fifty years. On very ex- 
posed situations, again, such as the tops of 
mountains, and what are called barren tracts, 
freely exposed on all hands, and which are the 
proper seats for this pine, the tree is reckoned 
to require about seventy years of age to 
mature its timber. It is impossible, however, 
to lay down rules which will reach every situ- 
ation and climate, and much must be left to 
the discernment of those who may have the 
charge of forests. Girting the stems will,

COXIEER.E. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



of course, show at any time how the trees 
are progressing ; and when a small increase 
only takes place, the question comes to he 
considered whether that addition to the 
bulk of the stem is sufficient to warrant the 
occupation of the land to the exclusion of 
young trees which would grow much more 
vigorously. 

The particular season of the year at which 
pine trees should be felled for timber is during 
those months when the sap is at rest, that is, 
from October till March. Summer felling, 
which is practised only in those countries 
where the snow lies deep for five or six 
months, deteriorates the wood to a certain 
extent by enclosing in the stems a large quan- 
tity of sap, and though this sap has its chan- 
nels in the outer part of the bole, the inner, or 
heart-wood, is also excited during the season 
of growth, and cannot then be in its fittest 
state for felling. 

Varieties. — These are very numerous, and 
have been long known to those at all inter- 
ested in the growth of pine timber. Many 
planters have considered that the great differ- 
ences in their appearance, and in the quality 
of the wood produced, arise from the nature 
of the soil and climate in which they may 
happen to be situated ; but these reasons are 
quite insufficient to meet the facts of the case. 
The Earl of Haddington, writing in 1760, 
says, " Though I have heard it asserted, that 
there is but one kind of Scots fir, and what 
difference is seen in the wood when wrought 
is only owing to the age of the tree, and the 
soil where it grew, yet I am convinced it is 
otherwise ; for this reason : when I cut firs 
that were too near the house, there were 
people alive here who remembered when my 
father bought the seed. It was all sown to- 
gether in the seed-bed, removed to a nursery, 
and afterwards planted out the same day. 
These trees I cut down, and saw some of them 
very white and spongy, others of them red and 
hard, though standing within a few yards of 
one another. This makes me gather my cones 
from the trees that have the reddest wood, as 
I have said before." Boutcher, who wrote 
some years after, confirms this statement ; and 
in Lawson's Museum, Edinburgh, are speci- 
mens of Scotch fir wood, of two distinct 
varieties, produced on the same soil. The 
fact is known to several planters in England. 
A few years since, Nathaniel Micklethwait, 
Esq., of Beeston Park, near Norwich, pre- 
sented the writer of the present article with 
pieces of Scotch pine- timber, remarkably dis- 
tinct from one another, one being white and 
soft, and the other quite hard, and so red that 
at a distance it was thought to have been 
painted of a reddish colour. The trees were 
of the same age, grew in the same climate, 



and in the same soil, being within two yai-ds 
of each other. 

P. s. horizoiitalis, Don of Forfar, Sang, 
Gr rigor, Lawson, and others. Leaves broader 
and of a lighter glaucous colour than those of 
the common tree. Branches more horizontal, 
often drooping and twisted. Bark, smooth, 
reddish. Timber red and hard. Cones small, 
few, with an appearance of being imperfectly 
formed. Seeds a third smaller than those of 
the common plant, resembling, in colour, those 
of the spruce fir. The red-wooded Pine of

A bold vigorous growing tree, with a 
shaggy head, the delight of painters, and 
valuable as producing timber equal to the best 
foreign deal. There are trees at Syon, under 
the name of P. rubra ; at Mrs. Day's, Horsford 
Hall, Norfolk ; and in many other parks in 
England. 

P.s. haguenensis,~Roih (Haguenau Pine). — 
So called from a village of that name on the 
Rhine, and near to which is an immense forest of 
this tree, covering about 30,000 acres. Leaves 
very long, twisted and finely serrated. Young 
plants more robust than those of the common 
tree. Bark smooth, scaly, not furrowed. 
There are fine tall trees of this variety in the 
woods of Robert Marsham, Esq., Stratton 
Strawless, Norfolk : and smaller trees at 
Loudon's Howe, and Loudon's Brae, in Perth- 
shire. The latter places are named in honour 
of the late Mr. Loudon, who supplied the 
seeds from which the young trees growing at 
those places were raised. Mr. Marsham re- 
presents the wood as excellent. 

P. s. uncinata, Don of Forfar. — Leaves 
serrulated, and cones hooked, or covered with 
prominent prickles, all regularly bent back- 
wards, which are the chief features character- 
istic of this variety. Discovered by Mr. 
Grigor, of Elgin, in the extensive woods of 
Main and Bishopmill, near Elgin. The tim- 
ber is of a yellowish colour, and rather better 
than that of P. sylvestris vulgaris. 

P. s. rigensis, Desfontaines (Riga Pine). 
■ — Not known to the writer, but in all proba- 
bility identical with some of the foregoing 
varieties. In Lawson's Manual it is observed 
that this plant " may at least be considered as 
possessed of equal merits with such as are 
derived from the best native forests in the 
Highlands of Scotland." Specimens of this 
tree may be seen at the Horticultural Society's 
Garden. 

P. s. mono'phylla, Hodgins. — Leaves very 
long and glaucous. A variety raised by Mr. 
Hodgins, of Dunganstown, near "VVicklow. It 
has not attracted general attention in Eng- 
land, and the only plant recorded is in 



CONIFERS. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE.

the garden of the Horticultural Society, Chis- 
wick. 

P. s. intermedia, Horticultural Society. — 
Leaves long, green ; branches slender, droop- 
ing. A rather distinct variety. A specimen 
stands in the Horticultural Society's Garden 
at C his wick. 

P. s. tortuosa, Don of Forfar. — Leaves 
short, twisted, resembling P. austriaca, and 
growing to the height of P. sylvestris 
vulgaris. 

Other varieties might be mentioned, but 
when the plants are compared with the fore- 
going, the difference is hard indeed to be 
detected. Thus P. genevensis is the common- 
est kind of Scotch fir. P. s. scariosa has 
gone back to the original ; and it is very 
doubtful if P. s. altissima is anything more 
than a vigorous growing plant of the same 
tree. 

Pinus pumilio, Henke (dwarf or Moun- 
tain Pine). — Leaves two, almost straight, short, 
thickly set on the branches, and deeply 
sheathed. Cones egg-shaped, without foot- 
stalks, truncate, or with blunt scales somewhat 
depressed, small, many of them bearing a 
striking resemblance to those of P. sylvestris 
horizontalis, or the red-wooded pine of the 
mountains of Scotland. 

A curious ornamental plant, scarcely entitled 
to be considered as a tree, originally from the 
mountains of France and Germany, whence 
it was introduced into this country in 1780. 
The tree has a* decumbent or trailing habit, 
which still distinguishes the original plant 
which stands at Orford Hall, near Warring- 
ton, in Lancashire. Of its wood no evidence is 
yet on record ; but from its bushy habit, it may 
be judged that it will never, in this respect, 
take the place of other well known varieties, 
and that it will be retained in plantations 
merely as a botanical curiosity. The outline of 
this pine might be greatly improved by close 
planting ; but it is constitutionally deficient 
in all those points necessary to form a good 
timber tree. It has been planted in several 
places in the north of Scotland; and the result 
is, that in the most exposed situations the 
plants are distinguished by a greater luxuri- 
ance of growth, and an intenser colour. This 
would indicate a favourable point in its cha- 
racter as adapted to high unsheltered places, 
and probably to the sea-side. The largest 
specimens in England are at White Knights, 
where they assume a tree-like form, chiefly on 
account of their having been drawn up 
amongst others. 

Varieties. — P.p. Fucheri, Booth, Lawson. 
—A plant raised by Mr. Booth, of the Flott- 
beck nurseries, in 1826, from seeds received 
from Philadelphia ; but by no means worthy 
of being separated from the species. Sped- 
48. 



mens are in the Hackney nursery, and in the 
arboretum of the Horticultural Society. 

P. p. rubratflora. — Another nominal va- 
riety, having the flowers of a pinkish or red 
colour, the only respect in which it differs 
from the species. A specimen at Dropmore, 
is fifteen feet high, covering a space upwards 
of sixty feet in circumference. 

Pinus Mugho, Du Hamel (Mugho Wild 
Pine). Leaves, two in a sheath, rigid and of 
a deep green. The male flowered catkins are 
nearly sessile. The ripe cones are rather 
larger than those of P. sylvestris, and their 
scales are swelled into well-defined protube- 
rances. The young buds are of a light brown 
colour, beautifully candied over with resinous 
exudation, which has the appearance of hav- 
ing been dropped. The leaves are more 
thickly distributed over the branches than in 
the Scotch pine ; yet it altogether bears such 
a close resemblance to that tree, that many 
botanists have considered it only as a variety. 
Few or perhaps none of our pine trees is sup- 
plied with resinous matter in such abundance, 
yet, from its dwarfish habit in very exposed 
situations, and on account of its comparatively 
small proportions, it is not likely to supersede 
others in the manufacture of tar, turpentine, 
&c. It is found indigenous in several dis- 
tricts of Germany, particularly on the Carin- 
thian and Carniolan mountains, also on the 
Pyrenees. Its cones are ripe at the same 
time as those of the P. sylvestris, and the 
directions given for extracting and sowing the 
seeds of that tree apply in every respect to 
the present species. The tree appears to 
delight in a deep sandy loam, several plants 
in the writer's nursery ground having made 
shoots, during the last season, eighteen inches 
in length. Some care is necessary in order 
that the young plants should be all started 
with a good leading shoot, the habit of the 
tree predisposing it to throw out vigorous 
side branches. Its timber is represented as 
rather inferior to that of the P. sylvestris. 

Varieties. — P. M. uncinata (hooked 
Mugho Pine). — A variety bearing a good deal 
of resemblance to the species. More compact 
in habit, and of quicker growth. A native of 
the Pyrenees and other European mountains, 
affecting a higher zone of vegetation than the 
Scotch pine, and producing timber of greater 
durability. Whether it will bear out this 
character away from its native mountains is 
very questionable. As to its hardiness there 
is little doubt, for at Rozelle, in Ayrshire, it 
has been tried extensively in valleys, slopes of 
hills, and on the tops of mountains, the last 
situation suiting it better than any other. 
" Those exposed to a good deal of storm," 
Mr. Locke observes, " are in reality greenest 
upon the stormy 6ide, and are thriving well,

COXIFER.E. — THE PINTJS, OR PINE TREE. 



while those planted in the low ground about 
the house are in a sickly state." The most 
unfavourable point relative to this tree is, 
that even where it thrives best it grows only 
at the rate of nine feet in twelve years. 
Nevertheless, as an alpine tree, it is well worth 
the attention of planters. There are speci- 
mens in the garden of the Horticultural Society. 
P. 31. nana, the Knee Pine of Upper 
Styria, where it affects the highest mountains 
in the form of a trailing bush. It is consi- 
dered to be extremely hardy. A specimen in 
the Dublin Botanic Garden, twenty years 
planted, is about two feet high only. 

Pinus resinosa, Aiton (red Pine). — A red 
barked tree, erect and tall. Leaves in pairs 
four to five inches long, almost straight, of a 
light glaucous green, tipped with yellow. 
Buds reddish brown, resinous, one inch and a 
half long, concave on the sides, with long fine 
points. Cones, two inches lonjr, obtuse ovate- 
oblong, of a brownish red colour, and almost 
without footstalks. Scales of cones dilated in 
the centre, and spineless. 

A noble tree bearing a general resemblance 
to P. Laricio, but altogether more open and 
airy in its growth, having the branches less 
intermixed, the foliage lighter, and the whole 
tree less robust. Viewed in its native coun- 
try, the United States, the plant will bear the 
highest recommendation both as an ornamen- 
tal object and as a timber tree. Its average 
altitude is seventy-five feet, with a bole six feet 
in circumference, retaining this girth to the 
height of about fifty feet. The bark is of a 
reddish colour, similar to that of P. sylvestris 
ltorizontalis ; a feature indeed which forms at 
once a distinguishing characteristic of the 
species. The leaves are tufted like brushes, 
another marked character of the plant, and 
rendering it very desirable on the lawn and 
pleasure ground. The wood is close, of com- 
pact grain, full of resinous matter, and conse- 
quently very enduring. It makes good pumps, 
and it is often laid down on decks of ships 
forty to fifty feet long, without exhibiting a 
single knot. It is often used as masts for 
large ships, and considerable quantities of it 
are imported into England to be used for 
house-building purposes. Viewed in this 
country, it almost ceases to interest any one 
as a prospective addition to our timber trees ; 
and it is now sharing the fate of the great 
majority of its kindred from America — being 
prized only as an ornamental object, but oc- 
cupying the first rank in that respect. At 
Rozelle in Ayrshire, it has not succeeded, 
though planted under the most favourable cir- 
cumstances. After seven years' trial, it was 
found not much larger than when removed 
from the nursery. Mr. Locke says, " we 
have been a good deal disappointed with this 



pine, after the high recommendations it haa 
from America." At Bollindalloch, Moray- 
shire, it gives better promise. At Dropmore, 
Berkshire, specimens of this tree are thirty feet 
high. There are good trees also at White 
Knights, Carclew in Cornwall, and at Chip- 
stead in Kent. It ought to have a place 
in every Pinetum. Plants are 2s. 6d. 

Pinus halepensis, Aiton (Aleppo Pine). 
— Leaves two and three in a sheath, but ge- 
nerally only two, from two inches to three 
inches long, slender, grass-like, remaining on 
for two years only, which accounts for the 
meagre appearance of the tree. Flowers 
appear in the beginning of June. The male 
catkins reddish, grouped on short pedicles ; the 
females, green, tinged with red, proceeding 
from the side of the branches. Cones on 
thick footstalks, pyramidal, regular in form, 
with depressed truncated scales, fawn coloured, 
and when perfectly ripe, grey. A widely 
distributed species, a native of Syria, Barbary, 
Spain, and France. 

A low grower, and only entitled to be 
considered as an ornamental plant in the cli- 
J mate of Britain. In this respect, however, it 
is really very desirable, and ought to be in the 
collection of every one who has an Arboretum. 
The winters in Scotland are too severe for it ; 
and those plants which were tried in the Pine- 
tum, at Rozelle, were killed a few years since. 
The fact that it thrives luxuriantly on slopes 
of hills near to the sea-side, at Runton, in 
Norfolk, may be of use to planters who have 
lands similarly situated. It has been planted 
, in considerable numbers in that district ; and 
j the secret of its great success there, is, in all 
i probability, to be found in the deep-trenched 
j soil in which it grows, coupled with its proxi- 
| mity to the sea which wards off the intensity 
of frost. There is no pine which displays such 
; an improvement when let loose from the re- 
straint of pot culture, so that its appearance 
' in nursery grounds would actually deter those 
j from trying it who had never seen it luxuriat- 
j ing in deep free soil where its roots are not 
confined. This plant might be rendered more 
fit to withstand the winters of the north if it 
were grafted on the Scotch pine. The seeds 
of this plant should be sown under glass, kept 
in a shady place out of doors till October, and 
protected during the winter in a greenhouse. 
When two years old, they might be planted 
into lines in the nursery, or placed singly in 
pots, and sunk in the open ground, sheltering 
them with dead branches, &c, during the 
winter months. Plants two feet high are 
Is. 6d. each. 

Varieties. — P. h. minor. A variation from 
the species only to the extent of the cones 
being smaller. A specimen in the Horticul- 
tural Society's Garden is from 25 to 30 feet high. 



CONIFERS. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



83 



Some writers have given a variety under 
the title of P. h. maritima, a plant which 
will be favourably noticed under the head of 
P. Pinaster minor, to which it evidently 
belongs. P. h. gemiensis, introduced by 
Captain Cook, is considered by Mr. Loudon 
to be identical with the species. 

Pinus bruttia, Tenore (Calabrian Pine). — 
Leavestwo, sixtonineincheslong, slender, pale 
green, wavy. Cones without footstalks, ovate, 
acute, very much crowded, with flattened 
scales. Buds ovate, without resin, half an 
inch long. 

A spreading tree of the middle size, not 
unlike the Aleppo Pine, but much hardier, 
and said to produce timber of excellent qua- 
lity. There are specimens at Kew, Drop- 
more, Hackney Arboretum, the Horticultural 
. Society's Garden, and at Chatsworth. Young 
plants have been raised by Mr. Lambert at 
Boyton, and distributed amongst his friends 
and the public Horticultural establishments 
of the country : but as yet little evidence has 
been adduced in regard to its suitableness to 
the climate of Britain. In Naples its wood 
is excellent ; and, at any rate, it is a most 
desirable species for ornament. 

Pinus pyrenaica, La Peyrouse (Pyrenean 
Pine). — Leaves two, long, clustered at the 
ends of the shoots and somewhat twisted or 
gathered around them, strong, upright, and of 
a bright green. Cones pointing horizontally, 
on strong footstalks, almost as thick as those 
of P. halepensis, ovate shaped, with scales 
round and truncate or bluntly pointed. 

The arboricultural world is indebted for 
this tree to Captain Cook, author of Sketches 
in Spain, a work peculiarly interesting to all 
those who have any love for the noble order 
of plants under consideration. It was intro- 
duced by him in 1834. He found it occupy- 
ing the highest range of the extensive forests 
of the Sierra de Segura in the southern dis- 
tricts of Spain, where it overtops P. halepen- 
sis, but not alone, being mingled with other 
pine trees in woods almost inaccessible from 
their extreme elevation. According to this 
gentleman the tree " is quite hardy, of quick 
growth, and will, from its noble appearance, 
the beauty of its form, and the clear transpa- 
rent colour of both the bark and foliage, be a 
vast acquisition to our park scenery. The 
timber is white and dry, being nearly without 
turpentine ; but the cones exude a most deli- 
cious balsamic odour. The wood was for- 
merly used by the Spanish government, in the 
arsenals of Carthagena and Cadiz, for the 
decks of ships ; for which purpose regular 
depots were kept in the Sierra de Segura ; 
and it was floated down to the respective 
ports by the rivers Segura and Quadalquiver. 
It is one of the species described in the book 



of Arab agriculture written by a Moor of 
Seville in 1200, and translated by Banqueri.' 
There are plants at Elvaston Castle, Chats- 
worth, Ballindalloch in Morayshire, and at 
Rozelle in Ayrshire, in which last place it is 
considered " a very compact and desirable 
ornamental pine, rather slow in growth." 
One of the finest specimens in England is said 
to be in the Horticultural Society's Garden. 

Pinus Banksiana, Lambert (Banks's, or 
Labrador Pine). — This was named in honour 
of Sir Joseph Banks, who sent the plant, or 
the seeds of it, to Mr. Lambert. Leaves two 
in a sheath, nearly 1| inch in length. Sheath 
of leaves short and ringed. Cones curiously 
twisted and recurved like small horns, persis- 
tent, that is, remaining on the trees for many 
years. They are very abundant, producing 
seeds of the size of the spruce fir. Buds are 
about I inch long, dotted with resin in large 
particles. The plant has a great many syno- 
nymes, by some of which it may be the more 
readily known : — The Scrub Pine, the Grey 
Pine, (from the grey cones which it bears,) 
the Hudson's Bay Pine, and the Pinus sylves- 
tris divaricata. 

This pine, in many respects, is valuable ; 
in others it is not so. It is to be prized for 
the singular, and in some instances, orna- 
mental character which it assumes, and be- 
cause it is so hardy that it may be introduced 
in almost every situation where the Scotch 
pine will thrive. The only exception to its 
hardiness, so far as the present writer knows, 
is to be found in an account of Coniferae 
recently introduced by Archibald Hamilton, 
Esq., Rozelle, Ayrshire, whose gardener thinks 
" the P. Banksiana will not suit this climate, 
either as a timber tree or an ornamental 
object. With us," he observes, "it resem- 
bles a stunted shrub rather than a hardy timber 
tree." The P. Banksiana is a native of 
America. In Nova Scotia it is called the 
Scrub Pine ; in Canada, the Grey Pine ; and 
in Halifax, the long-limbed Hudson's Bay 
Pine. Among the rocks of Labrador it is 
frequently met with of a height under ten 
feet ; and in some instances it assumes all the 
marks of old age and decrepitude when three 
feet high only. The handsomest tree in Eng- 
land is considered to be a specimen growing in 
the Pinetum at Dropmore ; and there are 
others in the Horticultural Society's Garden 
at Chiswick, and in the Hackney Nursery. It 
is a rather singular fact that in. Britain this 
tree grows with a rapidity and to a height not 
indicated by the species in its most favoured 
native habitats ; but it is to be feared that for 
mechanical purposes its wood will be on that 
account of less value. This pine is propa- 
gated by seeds sown in a mixture of peat and 
sand in the end of March, and covered to the

CONIFERS. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



depth of i inch. It may be also increased by- 
grafting on the Pinus sylvestris, a process 
which is said to improve the character of the 
species. In the Traite Pratique of Dela- 
marre, the operation is described as follows : 
— The species intended to be united should 
be as nearly allied as possible ; for, though 
P. Pinaster and P. Pinea may be grafted on 
the P. sylvestris, and the cedar on the larch, 
yet it is preferable (because the grafts succeed 
better, and the trees produced are likely to 
last longer,) to graft species which are ever- 
greens on evergreen stocks, and those with 
the leaves in bundles on stocks with the same 
number of leaves in a bundle. The operation 
of herbaceous grafting is performed in the 
cleft manner ; the slit being made a little 
deeper than that part of the scion which is to 
be inserted in it. The time of performing 
the operation is when the leading shoot of the 
stock has attained the length of from eight 
to twelve inches, and will break over (without 
tearing the bark,) like a piece of glass, or the 
most succulent part of a shoot of asparagus 
fit to gather for the table. The time during 
which any given species has its leading shoot 
in a fit state for being broken over in this 
manner is not more than 15 days ; and as the 
scions from the species to be grafted are 
equally tender with the stock, they will not 
remain longer in a state fit for the operation 
than about the same period. The graft should 
be inserted in the leading shoot, which should 
be broken with the hand so as to reduce it to 
the length of from four inches to six inches ; the 
leaves are then removed from this remaining 
portion, with the exception of about an inch 
at the top, on which they are left for the pur- 
pose of drawing up the sap. The scion should 
be about two inches in length, the lower part of 
which should be deprived of its leaves and cut 
in the form of a thin wedge, the operator 
using a very sharp knife. The graft should 
then be tied with matting or woollen, and 
then covered with a cap of paper, in the form 
of a candle extinguisher, so as to exclude the 
sunshine. The covering must of course be 
tied to the stock. About a fortnight after, 
the ligature may be removed. The process 
here detailed will of course serve for all other 
species of pines, the seeds of which are difficult 
to procure. 

Pinus Pallasiana, Lambert (Pallas's, or 
Tartarian Pine). — Leaves long, two in a 
sheath, nearly erect, channelled. Sheaths short 
with three rings. Cones somewhat curved, 
four to five inches in length. Bud one inch in 
length, somewhat in the shape of those of 
P. Laricio, but considerably larger. This 
plant has many synonymes, among which are 
the following : — P. taurica, P. viaritima, 
P. tatarica, P. halepensis, P. Laricio. 



A native of the Crimea, whence seeds of it 
were sent in 1790 to Messrs. Lee and Ken- 
nedy of the Hammersmith Nursery, who sent 
it out as P. tatarica. The wood of this tree 
is excellent ; but it can only be had of a ser- 
viceable length by planting the young trees so 
close to each other as to prevent the growth of 
any very large sized branches, and conse- 
quently of knots. This tree naturally assumes 
the habit of P. sylvestris, but often expends 
itself in large branches without a leader. It 
has the reputation of withstanding the effects 
of the sea air, and of growing tolerably on 
chalky soils ; but its high price, (7s. 6d.) has 
hitherto rendered it available only to a few ; 
and as it has not yet ripened its seeds in this 
climate, it will no doubt continue a high-priced 
plant. Grafting it on P. sylvestris or P. 
Laricio, is the only mode of overcoming the 
difficulty. 

Pinus Pinea, Linnaeus (Stone Pine). — 
Leaves two, and sometimes three in a sheath. 
Their being always in pairs is an error gene- 
rally current amongst botanists. The length 
of the leaves is about four inches, slightly 
waved, green on both sides alike, the tips of 
many of the branches retaining the leaves in 
their seedling state, which are about three-quar- 
ters of an inch long, proceeding singly from 
the twig. The leaves in this last state are of a 
pleasant sea-green colour. Buds are smaller 
than those of the pinaster, redder, and with- 
out resin. Cone from five to six inches 
lighter than those of the pinaster. Seeds 
three-quarters of an inch in length, encrusted 
with a thick bony case. 

This pine is scarcely known in England as 
a tree ; but in Italy, it assumes the majestic 
habit of the finest of our coniferas, having a 
tall straight trunk, and a thick branchy head, 
not unlike the Pinus Pinaster. Its charac- 
teristic appearance in landscapes has been 
sketched by Gilpin ; but there is every reason 
to suppose that his remarks were suggested 
by the pinaster, which, however, as seen in 
England, gives a very good idea of the former 
tree in its native habitations. It belongs 
naturally to Italy, Greece, Spain, and accord- 
ing to some authors, the southern parts of 
France, where it is found only in the neigh- 
bourhood of houses built for many years. It 
has been common in Britain for the last three 
hundred years ; and one of the best proofs of 
its being unsuited to this climate, either as a 
timber tree, or as a first-class ornamental 
plant, is found in the fact, that no lofty speci- 
men of it is noticed in the sylvan records of 
Britain. 

The plant is associated with the classics, 
chiefly on account of the delicious kernels of 
the fruit which were very much prized by 
the ancients. In their, preserved state, they

were found in the provision rooms of Pompeii 
and Herculaneum ; and throughout Italy, they 
are yet used along with raisins and almonds 
for dessert. Its wood is much inferior to the 
timber produced by other pines that grow 
twice as rapidly, so that it will never attain to 
any eminence in that respect. In English 
shrubberies, it forms a full-bodied spreading 
bush, and has a good effect in secluding places 
near to rock-work. The seeds may be pur- 
chased in London, at about 2s. per lb., and 
the best way to treat them is to steep them 
in rather hot water for two or three days pre- 
viously to sowing them. The time for sow- 
ing is the middle of April ; and it is important 
to remember that the soil in which they are 
placed should be kept rather moist with warm 
water for six weeks, when they will appear 
above ground. Where convenient, a bottom 
heat is recommended; for, on account of the 
hard shells in which they are enveloped, they 
require a good deal of excitement to start 
them. The young plants are somewhat tender, 
and should be kept protected during winter 
in a frame well matted over ; or in the open 
ground, by having branches with leaves on, 
stuck closely around them. They require to 
be shifted from place to place every two years, 
otherwise they form a hard and fibreless tap- 
root, which fails to support them on their 
removal. If in pots, they require shifting all 
the same. When finally removed, they should 
be planted deep, and staked, so as to resist the 
wind. 

Varieties. — P. P. fragilis. — A variety ex- 
tensively cultivated in Naples for the sake of 
the seed, which is enveloped in a thin and 
tender shell. The kernel is eaten by the in- 
habitants, and is sweet and agreeable. The 
thin and tender shell forms the only distinctive 
difference when compared with the common 
plant. 

P. P. cretica. — Leaves smaller, finer, and 
rather more abundant than in the species. 

P. P. americana. — A plant in no respect 
differing from the P. Pinea ; which, having 
been sent from America, was reckoned at least 
to be a variety. As Lindley observes, no tree 
has accompanied Europeans so closely as the 
Stone pine (from the seeds being edible) and 
this will account for old trees having been 
found in the new world, where it is not in- 
digenous. 

Pinus austriaca, Hoss (Austrian or black 
Pine.) — Leaves two in a sheath, keeping to- 
gether when the tree is young, three to four 
inches in length, twisted, bluntly-pointed, 
green all over alike. Buds about an inch in 
length, reddish-brown. Cones of the shape 
of those of P. sylvestris, of a light-brown 
colour, smooth and shining. 

A native of the mountains of Austria, grow- 



ing to the height of sixty and seventy feet. 
The wood of this tree has the reputation of 
being very enduring ; and in withstanding the 
effects of alternate moisture and dryness, it is 
said to equal the larch. The price at which 
plants are sold (7s. Qd. per 1000 for one year 
seedlings, and 15s. for two-years' seedlings), 
renders it within the reach of every planter ; 
and as it is now (1846) planted extensively in 
Scotland, a fair trial will be given to it. It is 
very necessary to watch this pine during the 
first few years of its growth, lest it should 
assume the habit of a bush merely. It is very 
apt to do so when potted, but in the free 
ground, it generally furnishes itself with a 
strong tap root, and a good leader. No pine 
excels this one in producing turpentine; and 
its roots are used in the same way as those of 
the Scotch pine, as a substitute for candles. 
At Rozelle in Ayrshire, Mr. Locke states, 
that comparing this tree with the Scotch pine, 
the former was found, in all soils and situa- 
tions in which it was tried, to take the lead 
in every instance. His only objection to the 
more extended planting of this truly fine tree, 
is the avidity with which it is devoured by 
game when first planted out. In order to 
obviate this, he recommends that the plants 
should be protected in a nursery till they are 
strong, and about eighteen inches in height- 
Seeds may be obtained at 4s. per lb. 

Pimcs Laricio, Poiret (Corsican or Larch 
Pine). — Leaves, generally two in a sheath, 
long, waved, frizzled, abundant, and of a deep 
green. Cones of the shape of P. sylvestris, 
two to three inches in length, with rugged 
truncated scales. Buds long, and particularly 
sharp, resinous, yet not covered with exuda- 
tion. A native of the mountains of Corsica, 
Spain, Greece, and Turkey, attaining some- 
times to the height of one hundred and fifty 
feet. 

A noble tree destined to occupy an impoi'- 
tant station in the British Sylva. When 
planted in groves, this pine bids fair to grow to 
the height of one hundred feet ; but in very 
exposed situations, it is apt to change its 
leading shoot, which no doubt arises from 
the topmost bud being injured by the cold. 
According to the testimony of many planters, 
this tree excels all others in the rapidity of 
its growth, which is frequently, in its young 
state, at the rate of two and a half feet in the 
year. It certainly does not carry that degree 
of thickness along with its height, which 
most pines do; for even when in the enjoy- 
ment of free air on all sides, it has the 
appearance of a plant which had been drawn 
up for want of space. The trial which has 
been made of this tree throughout Britain, 
does not justify its being recommended for 
sandy and barren tracts of land in very

CONIFERS. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



exposed places ; but for planting on the 
sides of hills, and for valleys, it is well fitted. 
For scenic effect, it would be difficult to 
select a better tree. Light and dai"kness are 
upon it in strongest contrast ; and in this re- 
spect, it is perhaps superior even to the better 
variety of Scotch pine. The very altitude of 
the tree gives it a commanding aspect, and it 
looks exceedingly well planted along with other 
pines, over which it rises in high towers. The 
wood is good for masts, though not equal to 
that of the P. sylvestris. When divested of 
the outside, or sap-wood, carpenters consider 
it equal to any other pine, and in its native 
countries, it is used by them in flooring, for 
beams, and for building purposes generally. 

The price of young plants is unreasonably 
high ; one shilling, and sometimes one shilling 
and sixpence being charged for each. This 
species is strongly recommended to the atten- 
tion of extensive planters, for there is no 
doubt that when large quantities are required, 
a proportionably low charge will be made. In 
the mean time, young shoots should be grafted 
on the tops of small plants of the Scotch pine ; 
a method of increasing the species which has 
been most successfully adopted by the French 
government. The mode of raising young 
plants from seeds, is exactly as detailed in the 
case of the Pinus sylcestris. 

This tree is particularly worthy of the at- 
tention of all those who wish speedily to confer 
a show of sylvan garniture about their resi- 
dences. In this respect it may accompany the 
willow, poplar, and larch. There are those 
again who complain that one man's life is too 
short to realize the full beauty of trees : this 
pine will obviate that objection, and become a 
high tree, strikinginthe landscape, inthecourse 
of twenty-five years. In cases whex'e it is ex- 
pected to grow very vigorously, trenching of 
the soil to the depth of at least two feet is 
absolutely necessary; and if strong stakes are 
put in to support the plants, it will add to 
their success. 

Varieties. — Nominally, the varieties of P. 
Laricio, are many. Continental catalogues 
are exceedingly apt to mislead planters, who 
have repeatedly found the same species under 
half a dozen different names. Such as are 
distinct are believed to be the two following : — 

P. L. corsicana, Delamarre. A tree grow- 
ing nearly as tall as the species, cones smaller, 
and of a tawny colour. 

P. L. caramanica, Bosc. Introduced into 
France by Olivier, in 1798. Throughout that 
country it bears the name of P. romana, 
which title is also adopted by the Horticultu- 
ral Society of London, in whose garden there 
is a fine specimen. Seeds which were sent by 
the late Mr. Loudon, to Methven Castle, pro- 
duced plants which grow more rapidly than 



the common Scotch fir, and the gardener there 
thinks that the tree may be found suitable to 
high districts throughout Scotland. This 
plant is more compact than the species, carry- 
ing a greater bulk of stem with it, and less 
subject to be operated upon by high winds. 
The leaves of this plant are rather straighter 
than in the species, and the buds and branches 
are of a redder colour. 

b. Scales of Cones Spiny at apex. 

13. Pinus Pinaster, Aiton (Cluster Pine). 
— Leaves, in pairs, very long, channelled, stiff, 
and of a darker green than those of the P. 
sylvestris. Cones in clusters, whorled, much 
shorter than the leaves, without footstalks, 
ovate, and about four inches long. Buds 
almost free from resin, woolly, and about 
three-quarters of an inch in length. A native 
of Italy, the southern parts of France, of 
Greece, Asia, and the Himalaya. The north 
of France and Germany do not possess it as 
an indigenous tree. It is very abundant in 
Spain, and is found in great perfection on the 
shores of the Mediterranean. 

The largest plantations of this tree in 
Britain, are at Westwick, in the county of 
Norfolk, on high, barren tracts of land, where 
it thrives remarkably well, and attains to a 
great bulk. These plantations were com- 
menced by J. Berney Petie, Esq., father of 
the present proprietor ; and in the Transac- 
tions of the Society for the Encouragement of 
Arts, appears the following communication 
relative to the planting of these trees. He 
says : " Having been a planter of firs and 
forest trees for more than fifty years upon a 
lai'ge scale, my friends have often solicited me 
to lay the particulars before your Society, as 
few in the kingdom have exceeded me in this 
pursuit. I am at length, induced to lay my 
labours before you in the following statement : — 
about thirty years ago, I planted in my 
park, and on the heath adjoining, about 200 
acres with different trees ; the soil of the 
latter was so poor that the Scotch firs which 
I chiefly appropriated to that place died after 
having been planted fifteen years, owing to 
the poverty of the soil and their exposed situ- 
ation. The pinaster, or cluster pine, has 
always been a favourite tree with me for the 
beauty of its foliage, and goodness of the 
timber. I have in my groves, I believe, 
some of the finest in the kingdom, estimated 
by Mr. Nathaniel Kent, of Craig's Court, a 
member of your Society, as containing five 
loads of timber in a tree, and upwards of 
eighty feet high ; it therefore occurred to me 
to raise some young plants from them, and 
when these plants were two years old, I filled 
up with these young pinasters the vacancies 
occasioned by the death of the Scotch firs,

and though planted sixteen years after them, 
they are now by far the largest and hand- 
somest trees. Upon observing the rapid 
growth of these trees, I was induced to 
enlarge my plantations, and took into my 
park 200 acres more, which I planted entirely 
with pinasters, except in the valleys where 
other trees grow. My pinaster plants were 
all raised from my own seed ; and this year 
their progress has been astonishing, and they 
are the admiration of all persons who have 
seen them. I am preparing to add another 
hundred acres, and have raised above 200,000 
plants for that purpose. I shall then have a 
plantation of 500 acres*, with a five-mile drive 
through it. December 1st, 1809." This is 
cheering information to proprietors of poor 
soil. It has been generally understood that 
the Scotch pine is, of all trees, the least scru- 
pulous as to the quality of the land they may 
be placed in ; but we have a proof here, that 
another individual of the cone-bearing family, 
is equally, if not more, serviceable in shelter- 
ing bleak and barren districts. 

The fact that few of the new pines produce 
wood at all equal to that of the Pinus sylves- 
tris, which can be got at such a low price 
throughout Britain, is at once a barrier to the 
introduction of many species of the noble 
family now under consideration. This cir- 
cumstance, however, ought not by any means 
to operate against the wide-spread introduc- 
tion of iheJP. Pinaster, and its valuable variety, 
the P, P. minor, or as the latter is generally 
called, the Pinus mavitima. The quality of 
the timber of any given tree is certainly one 
of the first points of importance ,* but if one 
can be selected which shall successfully carry 
down vegetation to the sides of the ocean, that 
feature should be sufficient of itself to stamp 
it as an object most worthy of cultivation.. 

To dilate upon the grand expanses of the 
sea, beheld from the deep recesses of a sylvan 
bower, is rather beside the object of this paper, 
yet it must not be overlooked that amongst 
the kw trees which we possess, suitable for 
maritime situations, the P. P. minor, ranks as 
one of the first objects to combine with the 
sublimest of all pictures exhibited on earth. 
Sea-side planting is, comparatively, a new 
study, but so far as it has been carried out, 
it has afforded a satisfaction which the pro- 
prietors of inland plantations have little con- 
ception of. Nature is ever ready to second 
and permanently record the well-directed 
exertions of men, and in this department, as 
well as in others, the beautiful adaptation ex- 
isting between certain objects and localities 
within her domain, is admirably exemplified 
in the luxuriance with which the plant rises 
when exposed to the sea air. On a cliff at 
Trimingham, in Norfolk, many of the plants 



may be seen rising fearlessly within fifteen 
yards of the German Ocean. What it may 
do for the immense districts lying waste in 
such situations, depends altogether on the en- 
terprise of proprietors who may be possessed 
of maritime lands. 

This tree, as an ornamental object, is un- 
questionably grand. In favourable situations 
it becomes a tall tree, displaying large portions 
of its bare reddish-brown branches, tufted 
with masses of rich foliage. The bark of the 
stem is deeply furrowed and coarse, and where 
this pine prevails, the feeling invariably awa- 
kened is, that you are in the neighbourhood of 
tremendous rocks and crags. 

The wood of the pinaster is reckoned softer 
than that of the common Scotch fir ; but ac- 
cording to the woodman at Mr. Petre's, deals 
of it, when raised on poor soils in exposed 
situations, are quite equal to any home-grown 
pine timber. In the countries where it is in- 
digenous, its chief use consists in its resinous 
products, tar, and lampblack. In France, it 
has been the means of reclaiming immense 
tracts of land which were perfectly destitute 
of any sort of vegetation. The plan adopted 
was, to sow the seeds along with those of 
broom, covering them with branches of trees 
so as to prevent the wind from removing the 
soil in which they were deposited. The 
broom affords shelter to the young pinasters 
for the first few years, after which it is over- 
topped and speedily smothered.. 

The way in which the seeds of this tree are 
procured, and their treatment,, are somewhat 
peculiar to this pine, and require special ob- 
servation. The cones are fully ripe in the 
month of March, when they should be gathered. 
I pay at the rate of two shillings per sack for 
the cones, and before they reach my nursery, 
an additional charge of four-pence per sack is 
made for carriage. The kiln, on which they 
are laid, and which I erected solely for the 
purpose of drying Coniferse, is in shape simi- 
lar to a malt-kiln ; but the cones are laid on 
wood instead of bricks, the latter admitting 
the heat to that degree so as to toast the seeds, 
and, of course, destroy their vegetating power. 
The boards on which the cones are laid are 
full of holes, through which the seeds fall ; and 
as they are by this means collected in the 
bottom of the pit, which is fifteen inches below 
the level of the fire-place, they are quite be- 
yond the reach of any heat calculated to injure 
them.. A cessation of heat takes place twice 
in a day, when the cones are completely turned 
over, and the boards swept clean of all the 
seeds, which are then removed from the 
bottom of the pit, or technically, the kiln-logie. 
The pinaster cones are much more difficult to 
open than those of any other pine ; and if 
they are gathered early in the season, they

CONIFERiE. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



require to be kept on the kiln for two days. 
The wings have then to be rubbed off, and 
the seeds sown in light land during the month 
of April. They should not remain in the 
seed-bed longer than two years, because they 
send down strong tap roots, without furnishing 
themselves with small fibres. This remark 
holds good with regard to this plant, so long as 
it remains in the nursery; for unless it is con- 
tinually shifted, it will be deficient in that 
bushiness of root, so essential to the species. 
One year seedling plants are ten shillings per 
thousand. 

Though it will seldom be found necessary 
for any person not in the seed business to 
erect a kiln for opening the cones of Conifers, 
it may be as well to state that the process is 
exceedingly hazardous. On account of the 
heat required (about 120 degrees Fahrenheit), 
and the inflammable nature of the cones them- 
selves, the probability is that inexperienced 
persons would set the kiln on fire. It should 
therefore in every instance form a detached 
building, and no boy should be allowed to 
tend the fire. The cones, after being so dried, 
form of all things the most desirable material 
for lighting fires. Threepence a bushel is rea- 
dily paid for them in the city of Norwich for 
that purpose. The seeds of the pinaster have 
a thick crust or shell about them ; and I have 
found it an excellent plan to steep them for 
a few days previous to sowing in water, kept 
as near as possible milk-warm. This helps 
them to vegetate. If sown in the usual way, 
a part of them only will come up three weeks 
afterwards, and the remainder during the sea- 
son. In dry weather watering the beds is 
absolutely necessary, when they are sprouting, 
because they vegetate, and then stop mid-way 
for want of moisture at their newly-formed 
roots. Seeds of the Pinaster may be always 
procured of the London seedsmen at from 2s. 
to 3s. per lb. ; but I am not aware that they 
keep the better variety, P. P. minor, dis- 
tinct from seeds of the common tree. 

Varieties. — These are numerous and impor- 
tant ; and as is the case with P. sylvestris, it 
may be safely questioned whether some of 
them are not of greater value than the species 
itself. At the same time, there are plants in 
nurseries belonging to the pinaster, which 
differ in name only, and which, having come 
from different -quarters of the globe, have on 
that account been considered worthy of a new 
title. Those received from Van Dieman's 
Land, America, and other places, have in all 
probability been gathered from trees raised 
from seeds, brought thither by emigrants many 
years since, and will present nothing really 
distinct from those already in the British 
Arboretum. Those considered distinct are 
tlie following : — 



P. P. Lemonianus, (Sir Charles Lemon's 
Pinaster). — Found in the woods of Sir Charles 
Lemon, at Carclew, Cornwall. In the Trans- 
actions of the Horticultural Society it is thus 
described : " In foliage it is similar to the 
pinaster ; but it differs in the general habit of 
the tree, and in the form and position of the 
cones. In the common pinaster, the cones, 
of which there are generally three or four 
together, are situated behind the shoots of the 
whorl, and, in the mature state, point back- 
wards. In this obscure species the cone is 
single, and it universally occupies the place 
of the leading shoot, the side shoots being 
behind it. The necessary consequence of this 
mode of growth is, that the tree can have no 
regular leader, but each year one of the side 
shoots strengthens, and continues the growth 
for the ensuing season ; the year following, 
the same process is repeated in another direc- 
tion, giving the stem of the tree a zig-zag 
appearance, which it never entirely loses." 
According to the statement of the forester at 
Westwick, Norfolk, the variety is to be found 
in the woods of his employer, Mr. Petre. 

P. P. minor. — A tree hardier than the 
species, and plentiful along the coasts of 
France, valuable on account of its braving 
the sea breeze, and growing on the most ste- 
rile tracts of land. Cones smaller than the 
species ; leaves stiffer, shorter, and broader. 
The tree does not grow so high as the species, 
hence at Westwick, in Norfolk, where it 
abounds, it is called the " False Pinaster." It 
is also found in the woods of Mr. Marsham, 
of Stratton Strawless, where the writer had a 
large quantity of the cones collected ; and 
from the seeds extracted he has now in his 
nursery grounds about 50,000 thriving plant. 1 ? 
of this valuable tree. The wood is more com- 
pact and durable than the common pinaster. 

P. P. Escarenus, Risso. — A very distinct 
variety, the leaves of the same length as in 
the species, but of a lighter green. Cones 
small, short, egg-shaped. Introduced by the 
Earl of Aberdeen, who presented a specimen 
to the London Horticultural Society, in whose 
garden is a tree fifteen feet high. 

P. P. variegatis. — This is a plant with 
variegated foliage, which forms its only dis- 
tinction. A specimen in the garden of the 
Horticultural Society is from fifteen feet to 
twenty feet high. The mode of propagating 
this variety is by grafting it on the common 
tree ; but it is by no means in general favour. 

P. P. nepalensis. — Raised from seeds sent 
by Dr. Wallich, and is the least distinct of 
all the varieties. The tree is somewhat more 
compact than the species, and the branches 
more horizontal in their growth. The cones 
are also narrower. 

P. P. Massoniana. — A variety probably 



CONIFERS. THE PINUS, OR PTNE TREE. 



89 



belonging to the Pinaster family, but as yet 
undetermined. Raised at the Cape of Good 
Hope from seeds sent from China. No living 
plants yet introduced. 

Another variety, which promises to be dis- 
tinct, is noticed by botanists, having cones 
similar to those of the Pinaster, though much 
smaller. It was found on the mountains of 
India by a collector sent out by the Duke of 
Devonshire, and its general appearance was 
like a stunted Scotch pine. The cones most 
resemble those of P. P. minor. Young plants 
are at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, and probably 
in the Garden of the Horticultural Society. 

Pmus pungens, Michaux (prickly-coned 
Pine). — The leaves are in pairs, thickly set, 
short, and acute. Cones ovate, or rather 
top-shaped, and armed with very sharp in- 
curved spines. The seeds are about the size 
of those of P. sylvestris, rough, and a majority 
of them black. 

Michaux, the American arboriculturist, 
states that this tree is confined to a narrow 
geographical range ; and that as it occupies a 
tract of country where the soil is good and 
the air salubrious, it will in all probability be 
the first to disappear before the inroads of 
cultivation. In form, it resembles the Scotch 
pine, though much more apt to break into a 
branchy head, and consequently it seldom 
attains a great altitude. Its timber is without 
praise, and in all probability it will remain in 
Britain valuable only as contributing to the 
variety of the genus. It has been forty years 
in this country, and the finest specimen, which 
is at Dropmore, is thirty-six feet high. 

Pinusinops, Aiton (Jersey or poor Pine). — 
Leaves two in a sheath, about two inches long. 
The sheaths have three or four distinct rings. 
The colour of the leaves is dark green. Buds 
are small, brown, and resinous, and are gene- 
rally surrounded by three small buds. Cones 
about three inches long, drooping, and covered 
with prominent spines. Young shoots of a 
purplish or violet colour, especially in the 
more vigorous ones. 

In stature this tree is inferior to the Scotch 
pine, attaining only to the height of forty 
feet, full of branches, which proceed irregu- 
larly from the trunk, like those of a broad- 
leaved tree. The habit of this pine prevents 
it from furnishing timber of a useful size, and 
throughout the interior of North America it 
is represented as fit only for fuel, the large 
proportion of sap wood which it contains 
speedily inducing decay. The balsamic odour 
which it emits in hot weather is certainly an 
inducement to have it in every pleasure 
ground. Plants are raised from seeds in the 
usual way ; but it should be grafted on high 
trees of the Scotch pine, when it would assume 
a singular and not inelegant appearance. 



Perhaps the finest young plants in England 
are in the plantations of Sir Edward North 
Buxton, Bart., at Runton, in the county of 
Norfolk. At Rozelle, in Ayrshire, plants of 
this species make growths of from fifteen to 
eighteen inches. They have proved to be 
perfectly hardy, having withstood the severity 
of 1837-8 without the slightest protection ; 
but generally it is a miserable looking tree. 
Cones are occasionally to be had in London at 
about 8d. per quart. 

Pinus mitis, Michaux (soft-leaved, or Yel- 
low Pine). — This valuable species is by many 
called P. variabilis. Leaves four inches in 
length, two and sometimes three in a sheath, 
channelled on the upper surface. Cones 
drooping, solitary, with footstalks, and the 
scales bearing inflexed spines. 

This is one of the most valuable American 
pines, and is well worthy of the attention of 
British planters on account of the timber 
which it produces. According to Michaux, 
it is used throughout the northern and middle 
states, and in Virginia, in the construction of 
doors, sashes for windows, and as flooring, 
being more solid and lasting than any other 
tree indigenous to that country. It abounds 
in Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, Albany, 
Pennsylvania, in South Carolina, and in the 
upper part of Georgia. It has been in Eng- 
land about a century, yet it is not often found 
even in our finest ornamental plantations. As 
an object of beauty, it is by no means defi- 
cient : its trunk is straight, something like 
that of a spruce fir, and the disposition of its 
branches very much resemble that of the 
latter tree. Its height, under favourable cir- 
cumstances, is from sixty to seventy feet. It 
forms an article of considerable commerce 
with this country ; and at Liverpool it is 
known under the name of the New York Pine. 
The attention of several railway companies 
has been directed to this tree as suitable for 
railway sleepers, and an importation has been 
made for that purpose. It will of course cost 
more than the home-grown pine at first, but 
it is expected to remain sound longer than 
six or seven years, the time which the timber 
grown in England lasts. Plants are 3s. 6d. 
each. 

As mentioned in reference to several of the 
foregoing species, Sir Edward North Bux- 
ton's plantations (which skirt the sea-beach 
in some places), exhibit very thriving young 
plants of many sorts of pines which are 
generally considered as unfit for the climate 
of Britain. This is an important fact. It would, 
however, be premature to conclude that all our 
more tender pines would find an asylum if 
placed in similar situations, because those re- 
ferred to have only been in their present places 
for five, six, and seven years.

NEW ESCULENT PLANTS. 



NEW ESCULENT PLANTS. 

At any time an addition to our lists of culti- 
vated esculents is regarded with interest, and 
deservedly so, for though such additions may 
not as regards intrinsic worth equal even some 
of those kinds we already cultivate, yet they 
afford variety on our tables ; and there is 
besides the probability of their proving adapted 
to certain soils and circumstances, where other 
more familiar kinds do not succeed so well. 
At the present juncture, however, after the 
partial failure of the crop of our chief esculent 
root — the potato — in the summers of 1845 
and 1846, additions of this kind become 
invested with much increased interest ; and 
this is equally the case whatever view may be 
taken of the visitation referred to. 

"We have been much interested in the 
perusal of an account of certain roots which 
are employed by natives of North West Ame- 
rica very extensively as articles of food, and 
which might prove useful to ourselves in a 
cultivated state. This account has been fur- 
nished by Mr. C. A. Geyer, and was published 
in a recent number of the London Journal of 
Botany. From this source we gather the 
following notes on the subject referred to : — 

The Gamass, Camass, or Quamash (Ca- 
massia esculenta, Lindley ; Nartheciitm Squa- 
mashf'Pursh. ;Phalangium Squamosa, Nuttall.) 
— This is a liliaceous plant found so abundantly 
on the fertile prairies of the great plateaux of 
Upper Oregon, as to give its name to them ; 
they are called the Gamass plains or prairies, 
and have a general elevation of 3,000 feet. 
When this plant is in bloom, these extensive 
plains are covered as with a carpet by its deep 
blue flowers. The plant much resembles a 
common blue hyacinth, and the bulb is also 
of about the same size, but in texture and 
shape more like that of Narcissus Tazetta. 
The raw bulb resembles in its substance the 
common squill ; by baking it acquires a sweet 
taste, and when boiled the taste is not unlike 
the syrup of squills, but not so sweet. The 
Gamass of the Oregon seems to differ from 
that of the Missouri and Illinois in being alto- 
gether more robust, having bulbs twice as 
large, shorter, stiffer, leaves, and longer ra- 
cemes of larger flowers. 

Mr. Geyer gives the following account of 
the digging and preparing of this root : — 
The digging of the Gamass bulb is a feast for 
old and young among the Indians. The differ- 
ent neighbouring tribes meet on the same 
plain, and mostly at the same time, at the same 
spot where their forefathers met. Here the 
old men talk over tales of olden time ; the 
young relate hunting adventures, and pass 
their time in gaming ; while on the women 
alone, young and old, rests the whole labour 



of gathering that indispensable food. The 
young women, especially, vie with each other 
in collecting the greatest possible quantity 
and best quality, their fame for future good 
wives depending much on the industry they 
show there. Many a marriage is closed after 
the Gamass are brought home. The Indians 
gather this root after their return from gather- 
ing the Biscuit root. The whole village is 
active collecting horses and sacks, the latter 
chiefly of Thujabass or Helonias roots, and at 
last family after family leave the village for the 
plains. The digging takes place as soon as 
the lower half of the flowers on the racemes 
begin to fade, or when the flowering is entirely 
passed. For the purpose, the Indian women 
use a stick two feet long, curved like a sabre, 
of hawthorn wood, which is provided with a 
cross piece of elk horn at the top, serving as a 
handle. This instrument they use with asto- 
nishing dexterity, so that they very seldom 
strike the point twice after the same bulb. 
Four or five sacks of raw bulbs isa common day's 
labour, which dwindle to about two after baking 
and drying. As soon as a sufficient quantity 
of bulbs are gathered, they prepare for 
baking ; for that purpose they dig or scrape a 
hole in the ground three or four feet in depth, 
make a fire and throw in a layer of red hot 
stones, then a layer of clean grass over these, 
and now a layer of Gamass, the latter having 
been cleaned from the adhering soil ; this is 
repeated until the hole is level with the ground 
above ; the fire is now made on the top of 
the pit, and kept burning for twenty-four 
hours or longer. When the Gamass are 
baked, the Indians feast from lodge to lodge, 
and nothing can make them recollect that they 
are hungry and starved for nearly two 
months. 

The Gamass appears to have been intro- 
duced to this country in 1827 ; and is a 
strikingly handsome bulbous plant with large 
flowers : a border of peat earth is recom- 
mended for it, and the cool shade of a north 
wall. It does not appear to have been culti- 
vated at all in this country as an esculent. 

The Biscuit Root (Ferula spS) — This is a 
small umbelliferous plant, also producing deli- 
cate tubers , which are much used as food. There 
appear to be several species of Ferula, of which 
the tubers of all are used in a similar way. 
That known as the Biscuit root, is represented 
as a humble plant emerging from the sand 
under the influence of the first rays of the sun 
in March or April ; in about three weeks 
attaining a blooming state, and again in about 
the same period ripened,, and its dried stalks 
scattered over the plains by the winds. Thus 
the whole period of the vegetation of this 
plant does not exceed six weeks. The tubers 
when three or four years old are about the

size of a walnut, but these are inferior to the 
thin spindle-formed two-year old tender tubers. 
The substance is farinaceous, snowy white, 
and in the young tubers not entirely insipid. 
The Indians gather the tubers when the plant 
is in the flowering state. It is found in the 
sandy woods in the basaltic plains of Upper 
Oregon, at an elevation of about 2000 feet. 

Mr. Geyer mentions another and more re- 
markable species of Ferula (the Pooli-Pooh 
root of the Spokans) which he had not seen 
growing, and only knew from a few dried 
leaves which were twice the size of the former ; 
the tubers of this are about the size of a small 
potato, and contain a white farinaceous sub- 
stance ; they have a rather strong but plea- 
sant aromatic odour and taste resembling 
citron, which they keep for more than a year. 
They are rare. The Indians gather them in 
small quantities, and string them. This, he 
says, would be a great acquisition for our 
kitchen gardens. 

The Sptstlum, Bitter root plant, or JRacine 
amare (Leivhia rediviva, Pursh). The 
Indians value this root highly, and it is with 
them, prepared with the marrow of the bison, 
regarded as a most dainty dish. Travellers 
also use it as a very wholesome food, and it is 
prized notwithstanding its strong bitter taste, 
which resembles the bitter of Chinabark. The 
plant is related to Mesembryanthemum, and 
has a fusiform flexible root, capitate stem, the 
leaves soon dying away, the flowers handsome, 
of a beautiful rose-purple colour. The root 
is dug during flower time, when the cuticle is 
easily removed, by which it acquires a white 
colour ; it is brittle, and by transportation 
broken to small pieces. When the bark is 
thus stripped off the roots, they appear to con- 
sist of little else than starch. Before boiling 
it is steeped in water, which makes it swell, 
and after boiling it becomes five to six times 
larger in size, and resembles a jelly-like sub- 
stance. Being a small root, it requires much 
labour to gather a sack, which generally com- 
mands the price of a horse. Six weeks at 
most is the period during which the Lewisia 
vegetates above ground for the whole year. 
At first the fascicles ofleaves show themselves 
soon after the scapes ; as soon as the first 
flower begins to open, the leaves die away ; 
the flower is only open during sunshine. The 
plant occurs sparingly on the plains of the 
Upper Platte j quite abundant on the Upper 
Clarke river, which is on that account deno- 
minated lliviere aux Racines Amares by the 
Canadians ; but far more abundant on the 
arid basaltic plains of Upper Oregon, at an 
elevation of about 2000 feet. The flowers are 
pale in colour on rocky ground, but it is a very 
elegant plant in the sandy woods. 

The plant was named Lewisia, by Pursh, 



from having been first collected by Capt. M. 
Lewis ; the name rediviva was appropriately 
given in consequence of Lewis's preserved 
specimen having revived and grown at the 
Kew garden, after having been about three years 
out of ground between paper. In our cata- 
logues it is recorded as having been introduced 
in 1826. 

Helosciadium californicum. — Mr. Geyer 
mentions an umbelliferous plant, which is 
found throughout Upper Oregon, on grassy 
moist slopes, and in shady meadows, the 
tubers of which are truly delicious, and one 
of the dainty dishes of the Saptona Indians. 
He supposes this plant to be the Helosci- 
adium californicum (Douglas). It is an in- 
conspicuous umbelliferous perennial, with a 
black tuberous root. By boiling the tubers 
like potatoes they burst open lengthways, 
showing a snowy white farinaceous substance, 
which has a sweet cream-like taste, and some- 
what of the aroma of young parsley leaves. 
This plant Mr. Geyer thinks would be an ex- 
cellent addition to kitchen gardens. It holds 
in Oregon exactly the place which the wild 
carrot does with us ; and there is no doubt 
the roots would similarly increase in size by 
cultivation. 

A comparison should hardly be drawn be- 
tween these plants in their aboriginal condi- 
tion, and the cultivated varieties of our 
esculent vegetables : but if they are compared 
it should be with the latter also in their wild 
condition. Such a comparison is full of en- 
couragement, for perhaps hardly any of our 
cultivated vegetables have sprung from sub- 
jects originally so promising as these. The 
proper course would be to cultivate highly, to 
raise successive crops from seed, preserving 
in each generation for the purpose of seeding 
those only which manifest some improvement. 
In this way there is little doubt,, that varieties 
as far removed in excellence as the cultivated 
cabbages or carrots from their original stock 
would be obtained.

NOTES ON FLOWERS AND ELOWERIiN G PLANTS. 



Victoria regia, Lindley (Victoria Water 
lily). — Nymphreaceas § Euryalideas. — This is 
the most magnificent aquatic plant known. 
It has the character of our water lilies, but is 
very much larger. It is supposed to be a 
perennial, but this is not positively known ; 
the root is large and tuberous, with numerous 
fibres. From these tubers proceed the float- 
ing leaves on long prickly stalks ; they are of 
prodigious size, four to six and a half feet in 
diameter, nearly round, peltate, with from two 
to five inches of the margin turned up all 
round, forming a rim like that of a tea-tray ; 
the upper side is green, the lower side deep 
purple, with copious prominent prickly veins. 
The flower stalks spring from the root ; they 
are prickly, and each bear one flower, rising a 
little above the water ; the flowers are from 
a foot to fifteen inches in diameter, fragrant, 
with very numerous oblong concave petals, 
which gradually pass into filaments, the outer 
ones being white, changing to pink, the inner 
deep rose coloured. A native of South Ame- 
rica, found chiefly on the waters tributary of 
the Amazons, and Rio Plata, and probably 
existing in all those great rivers which inter- 
sect the immense plains eastward of the Andes. 
Introduced to Kew in 1846 ; but the plants 
have since died. Time of flowering un- 
known. In the River Berbice, it was met with 
in a flowering state on the 1st of January. 
Culture. — Requires stove heat, and a large 
body of water, which should be warmed in the 
growing season to from 80 to 90 degrees : the 
roots should be planted in loam ; propagated 
by seeds, probably also by division. (29) 

Statice eximia, Fischer and Meyer 
(large pink Sea Lavender). — Prumbaginaceaa 
§ Staticeas. — A perennial plant, growing from 
one to two feet high, with a tuft of oblong 
ovate root leaves, and a leafless branching 
flower scape, the branches consisting of a 
dense bundle or cluster of small pinkish lilac 
flowers, which, from their number and ar- 
rangement, have a very pretty appearance. 
A native of open places in the south of Son- 
garia, on the Chinese limits. Introduced in 
1844. Flowers from July to September. 
Culture. — Hardy ; sandy loam and peat ; 
propagated by division of the plant, or by 
seeds. (30)

purple colour, with an orange blotch at the 
base. A native of the mountain of Delphi, 
in Euboea, and other mountains of Greece. 
Introduced in 1845 (?) Flowers in March 
and April. It has been called C. sublimits 
(Herbert). Culture. — Hardy ; any common 



soil ; propagated by off-sets from the roots ; 
seeds are liable to variation. (31) 

Crocus Veluchensis, Herbert ( Veluchian 
Crocus). — Iridaceaj. — A small bulbous plant 
growing about three inches high, with com- 
paratively large flowers rather in advance of 
the foliage ; the flowers are well formed, the 
petals somewhat concave, of a violet tint vary- 
ing in intensity, but having a darker trans- 
verse bar near the top of each segment ; in 
some instances, the tip above this bar is nearly 
white. A native of Mount Veluchi, in 
.ZEtolia. Introduced in 1845 (?) Flowers in 
March and April. Culture. — Hardy; common 
soil ; propagated by off-sets from the roots ; 
seeds are not to be depended on, as they often 
produce varieties. (32) 

Caloscordum nerineflorum, Herbert 
(Nerine-flowered Caloscord). — Liliaceaa § 
Scilleas. — An interesting little bulbous plant, 
with a few roundish very slender leaves a span 
long, and throwing up from the small bulbous 
root a slender flower stem of six or eight 
inches high, beai-ing at the top an umbel of 
a dozen or more rather pretty rose-coloured 
flowers, about half an inch in diameter, and 
composed of six somewhat recurved oval seg- 
ments. The plant is nearly allied to the 
Alliums or garlics, but has none of their smell.

most to the centre into five spatula-shapedlobes. 
A native of the higher ranges of the Hima- 
layan mountains. Introduced in 1844. 
Flowers in August and September. The 
position of this plant in the ' natural arrange- 
ment' of vegetables, is yet (1847) a botanical 
enigma. Culture. — Hardy, but requires to be 
kept somewhat dry and at rest when not grow- 
ing ; sandy peat and leaf mould ; propagated 
by cuttings. (34)

from the roots, not by seeds, which vary. (37) 

Crocus Byzantinus, Parkinson (Turkish 
Crocus). — Iridaceaa. — A small but very pretty 
bulbous plant, growing four or five inches high, 
and flowering without leaves, that is, the 
flowers and leaves grow at distinct periods ; 
the three outer segments of the flowers are 
broad and expand much, and are of a violet 
purple ; the three inner ones are neaily erect, 
and much narrower and paler ; in the centre 
is a large purple feathered stigma. A native 
of the woods of Bannat, and the neighbour- 
hood of Crajova in Wallachia. Introduced 
before 1629, but confounded with other kinds.

heart-shaped leaves, seated close to the stem, 
and very numerous axillary blossoms, pro- 
duced along the vigorous young shoots ; the 
blossoms are long, tubular, and of a fine light 
scarlet colour, tipped with pure white. It 
differs from the well-known E. grandiflora, 
chiefly in the colour of the flowers. It is a 
native of New Holland, and was raised by 
Messrs. Loddiges. Introduced about 1843. 
Flowers from March to June. Culture. — 
Requires a greenhouse ; light, turfy peat soil ; 
very careful watering at all times ; propagated

plant, with a creeping root stock, which pro- 
duces several oblong-ovate pseudo-bulbs, each 
bearing one oblong leathery leaf from the top; 
the flower then grows from the base of the 
pseudo-bulb, six or eight inches high, bearing

— Hardy ; sandy loam, and good drainage in 
winter ; propagated by off-sets or seed. 




CELMISIA VERNICOSA. 
(Br. J. B. Booker). 

THE VARXISHED CELMISIA. 



This is a very beautiful plant from the Ant- 
arctic regions, which it is desirable should be 
speedily introduced to our collections: it is at 
present only known from the beautiful draw- 
ing published in the Flora Antarctica, to 
which source we are indebted for the illus- 
tration which accompanies these remarks. 

The plant is not what is understood by a 
herbaceous plant, but it is an almost stem- 
less one, with a dense tuft of rigid linear 
remotely serrated leaves, from among which 
proceed the ascending scapes (or flower stems), 
which are furnished with small linear lance- 
olate leaves (or bracts) throughout their 
length, and are each terminated by a solitary 
flower, nearly two inches in diameter, of very 
delicate tinting, white or faint rose, which 
forms a striking contrast to the dark purple 
of the eye or disc. Ihe leaves which grow 
on some specimens in tufts nearly a span 
across, lie densely compacted, and spreading 
horizontally, radiating from the summit of the 
root, like the spokes of a wheel, and have a 
peculiar deep green, glossy, varnished appear- 



ance, shining like the surface of a shell, or as 
if covered with a thick coat of copal varnish. 
When in bloom, the plant must be an exceed- 
ingly gay one. 

Like other of the Antarctic plants, the pre- 
sent varies considerably in size from that just 
described to a much more diminutive state, in 
which the tuft of leaves scarcely exceed an 
inch and a half in diameter. In cultivation, 
it will therefore probably be desirable to 
grow the specimens with tolerable freedom, 
or perhaps the larger form only should be 
introduced, as the variation in size may be 
perpetuated through succeeding generations. 

It is found on Lord Auckland's group both 
on banks and rocky places near the sum- 
mits of the hills, at an altitude of 1200 feet 
above the sea ; and also near the sea on 
the exposed islets. Campbell's island also 
affords it, and it is there found in abundance 
in the immediate vicinity of the sea. This 
ought not to be overlooked in its artificial 
cultivation. The species ranks among Com- 
posite plants.

FORCING PLANTS FOR CUT FLOWERS. 

The great art of forcing is lost sight of by a 
majority of those who even profess forcing; 
we do not say by all, because there are some 
who know their business ; but a vast majority 
are content to take plants that are well esta- 
blished in pots, and to gently move them on, 
and at last add heat and so on until they 
flower. These, however, ar-e scarce, and a 
plant will be damaged a good deal by the cut- 
ting of the few flowers there may be, and they 
are then taken care of to get round again in 
condition for selling as plants, but the whole 
business is mistaken. Take established plants 
to begin with, but lose the first years' flowers-, 
begin early, get them as forward as possible, 
and as the flowers come, or either as the buds 
come, the first season pick them off, and keep 
the plant growing till it has made fair wood. 
The roses will complete their growth as well 
as camellias, daphnes, or other plants adapted 
for supplying cut flowers. As this comple- 
tion of the growth will be very much earlier 
than is usual, the next thing to mind is to 
keep them well watered, but as soon as it is 
completed, the plants should be removed to 
the coolest places, and be kept comparatively 
dry. Here they may remain to harden, and 
to be ready to start again early. Remove 
them into the house, and introduce fire heat 
very gradually. The plants, from their pre- 
vious years' early work, and having become 
partly inured to early work, grow sooner and 
stronger than they did the first season. We 
ought to have observed that roses have to be 
pruned much the same as if they were in the 
open air, but the second season they bear three 
times as many flowers as they would have 
borne the first, and the same plants ought to 
be forced year after year, because they become 
used to the altered season ; and if it be desired 
to make the flowers come very early, they 
have only to be taken into the house earlier 
every year till you have brought them into a 
regular habit of starting and growing early. 
The same plants shifted into larger pots from 
year to year, or as often as they require it, 
will continue to get better as they get older, 
and yield more flowers and better flowers 
with the growth, and most of them will 
come as natural three months earlier than 
the usual season, as the others do out of doors 
or under ordinary treatment. Camellias may 
be very well brought to flower regularly in 
October and November, instead of March and 
April. All we have to do is, to match as 
nearly as we can the season of rest, for it is 
the ripening of the wood that is the most 
important feature in the management ; but in 
many plants it is quite practicable to reverse 
the season of flowers, and at no period was it 



ever more desirable than at present, when the 
demand for cut flowers is almost greater in 
Avinter than in summer. Nothing has been 
more common than to fancy that a year's rest 
should be given to plants that are forced. 
Nothing, however, can be more mistaken. 
Plants should continually be used to go to 
work early, and the more they are used to it, 
the better the flowers and the more of them. 

NEW GARDEN FRUITS. 

The following notes on some new fruits 
which have recently been brought into notice, 
may be appropriately prefaced by the remark, 
that even yet, notwithstanding the many ex- 
cellent varieties we possess, the qualities of 
some of those classes of fruit which are in 
cultivation admit of much further improve- 
ment by the same means which the florist 
adopts to improve, or rather mould to his 
fancy, the flowers which he specially prizes. 

GRAPES. 

Josling's St. Albans. — This is a white grape 
of great excellence, possessing the peculiarly 
rich musky flavour which characterises the 
muscats and frontignans. The bunches are 
very long, and tapering with strong diverging 
shoulders ; and they are supported by a strong 
footstalk : the berries are round greenish- 
white, acquiring a tinge of golden yellow 
when well ripened, and about the size of those 
of the white Frontignan ; the flesh is firmer 
than that of Frontignan grapes, but not so 
firm as that of the Muscat of Alexandria, 
very rich and sugary with a Frontignan fla- 
vour. The leaves are tolerably round in 
general outline, not deeply lobed, but sharply 
serrated, and remarkably glabrous on both 
surfaces. It was raised by Mr. Josling, nur- 
seryman, of St. Albans, from seeds gathered 
promiscuously, and sown about six years ago ; 
he supposes it to be a hybrid between the 
White Nice, and the White Muscat. Like 
these, it will require to be grown in a warm 
house. 

Calabrian Raisin (Raisin de Caldbre). 
— This is a late white grape ; desirable as a 
contrast to the black St. Peter's — one of the 
best grapes known for keeping very late. 
The bunches are large, slightly shouldered, 
long and tapering ; the berries are large, quite 
round and transparent; the flesh is moderately 
firm, with a rich sugary juice. The vine 
grows vigorously, is a good bearer, and has a 
disposition to form very large bunches. It 
is chiefly valuable as being a late grape, with 
the property of hanging long after it is ripe, 
and it will also keep for a considerable time 
after being cut, so that with good manage- 
ment it may be preserved for months in a

fresh state fit for the dessert. A white grape of 
good quality, possessing this property of keep- 
ing well, was before a desideratum. It was 
obtained by the Horticultural Society of Lon- 
don, from the nursery of Messrs. Baurnann, of 
Bolwyller, on the Upper Rhine. 

NECTARINE. 

Stanwick. — This variety of nectarine is 
remarkable from its having sweet kernels. It 
is well known that the kernels of these fruits 
and of peaches, partake of the qualities of the 
bitter almond, and even the flesh and luscious 
juice is not entirely free from this flavour of 
prussic acid. It was not indeed anticipated 
that this quality would ever be entirely re- 
moved. The Stanwick nectarine is like the 
Elruge in size and shape, but rather less heart- 
shaped at the base. Its skin is pale like the 
White nectarine — where shaded, with a violet 
tinge next the sun : the flesh is white, tender, 
juicy, rich, and sugary, without the slightest 
trace of the flavour of prussic acid. The 
stone is middle-sized, ovate, with a prominent 
sharp edge, very rugged, and of a chocolate 
colour : the kernel is sweet like a nut, with 
none of the bitter almond flavour. The tree 
is robust, growing late in autumn, and hitherto 
retaining its leaves through the winter: there 
is no doubt, however, that it will be found 
adapted to bear the usual treatment of wall- 
trees. The fruit ripens towards the end of 
September. It was raised from stones brought 
to England by Mr. Barker, formerly Her 
Majesty's Consul at Aleppo, and was raised 
in 1843, in the garden of Lord Prudhoe, at 
Stanwick Park, where it fruited in 1846. 

PLU3IS. 

Jefferson. — This is an American variety 
of the highest excellence, fully equal, if not 
superior to the Green Gage. The fruit is 
large and roundish oval, with a stalk about an 
inch in length : the skin is dark yellow, re- 
markably speckled with purple and brownish 
red; the flesh is deep orange coloured, juicy, 
and exceedingly rich and sugary, &c, slightly 
adhering to the stone, which is middle-sized 
and elliptic. It ripens about the third week 
in September, or probably in the generality 
of seasons a little earlier. The fruit has the 
property of hanging a considerable time on 
the tree after being ripe. The tree is a great 
bearer as a standard, with smooth, or very 
slightly downy upright shoots, and middle- 
sized elliptic, serrated, or acutely crenated 
leaves, glabrous on the upper surface. It 
was raised by the late Judge Buel, at Albany. 

Heine Claude de Bavey. — This is a variety 
of the Green Gage, nearly double in size, ripen- 
ing ten days or a fortnight later, and possessing 
the good qualities of that esteemed variety. 



It ripens generally about the end of September. 
Raised from seed by M. Esperin de Marines. 
Guthrie's Apricot. — A yellow plum, ripen- 
ing about the end of September. Raised by 
Mr. Guthrie, of Dundee. 

PEAR. 

Chohvell. — A good early pear ; succeeds 
well as a standard. The fruit is about three 
inches long, and nearly two inches in diameter 
at the widest part, curved pyramidal, with a 
small open eye, and a slender obliquely at- 
tached stalk. The skin is smooth, thin, yel- 
lowish green where shaded, faintly tinged, and 
obscurely streaked with dull red next the sun, 
where it is also sprinkled with pale dots : the 
flesh is yellowish white, melting, buttery, very 
sugary and rich, with a musky flavour. It 
ripens at the end of September and beginning 
of October. It was received by the Horti- 
cultural Society from Dr. Soper, of Ashburton. 

APPLES. 

Barton's Seedling. — This apple somewhat 
resembles a very fine Mank's Codlin, when 
grown in the shade, being of a deep cream 
colour, the fruit looking as if varnished. It 
is of good size, and a great bearer ; the flesh 
is rather soft, but of fine flavour. 

Pine-apple, White's. — A seedling from the 
old Golden Pippin, which it resembles in shape, 
but is larger ; the skin is a rich orange yellow, 
partially russeted ; the flesh yellow, very rich, 
and sugary. It is an excellent dessert apple, 
in season from December till February. The 
tree is a good bearer. 

Pitmuston Golden Pippin. — This is a seed- 
ling from the Golden Pippin, which it a good 
deal resembles, being a good dessert fruit, of 
firm flesh, and rich saccharine flavour, more 
sugary, but not so juicy as the old Golden 
Pippin. The tree is vigorous and bears well. 

Stoke Park Pippin. — This is probably a 
seedling from the Golden Pippin, as it much 
resembles it in general qualities. It is a good 
dessert fruit, sugary, and firm. The tree 
bears well, but is liable to canker. 

RASPBERRY. 

Scalter's Magnum Bonum. — A white fruited 
variety, of very large size, combined with a 
fine flavour. The plant is of strong robust 
habit, and very prolific. 

STRAWBERRY. 

Bicton. — This is a fine late white straw- 
berry, raised at Bicton, in Devonshire. It is 
an abundant bearer, and though not very 
highly flavoured, will prove useful from its 
coming late into bearing when most other 
kinds are past. It belongs to the class of 
Chili strawberries. The fruit is of moderate 
size, whitish in colour, and of somewhat flat- 
tened oblong figure.

GLENNY ON THE CALCEOLARIA; 



ITS VARIETIES AND CULTURE. 



Some species of the Calceolaria have heen 
cultivated for years in the English gardens, 
but their elevation to the dignity of a flo- 
rist's flower is of comparatively recent date. 
Messrs. Young and Penny have the doubtful 
credit of making the first move in hybridizing 
some of opposite characters ; and Mr. Groom 
made early progress in collecting and selling 
some of the most remarkable. It is most 
likely that the work of hybridizing, as it is 
called, was going on simultaneously in several 
places, for there were many very singular, 
and, looking as we always do at the habit of 
plants, we may say beautiful varieties, offered 
about the same period, retaining all the 
shrubby properties, and possessing many bril- 
liant colours. Perhaps the worst thing that 
ever occurred in the progress of this plant 
towards perfection, was the awarding of prizes 
to herbaceous varieties, as well as shrubby 
kinds ; for it induced people to grow both, 
48. 



and led to a degeneration of both. We have 
always maintained that the shrubby ones only 
deserve the distinction of florists' flowers ; and 
it is now difficult to find, even among those 
honoured with prizes, anything like a good 
habit of plant. The herbaceous varieties give 
us the largest flowers ; and the captivation of 
size with people who do not study all the pro- 
perties of plants, led too many to encourage 
the herbaceous kinds for that property only. 
Mr. Green, gardener to Sir P^dmund Antrobus, 
was the first and most successful exhibitor of 
this elegant subject ; and the enormous flow- 
ers on some of his herbaceous varieties, com- 
pletely rivetted the attention of those whose 
taste, or want of taste, induced them to value 
flowers by measure. Mr. Green, so far as our 
observations went, was as completely in ad- 
vance with calceolarias, as Mr. Thompson of 
Iver was with pansies; and a spirit of emula- 
tion led others to buy his best sorts, aud set to 



OS 



■G LENNY ON THE CALCEOLARIA. 



work with seedlings themselves. It is well 
known in the floricultural world, that our 
standard of excellence is a perfectly round 
flower, on a completely shrubby plant ; and 
the novelties are now principally estimated by 
that standard, though there is much to do 
before it can be obtained, even should it ever 
be accomplished. Still, as herbaceous varie- 
ties, and the plants partaking of that habit, 
afford the largest blooms, it is difficult to make 
many judges pay sufficient attention to the 
superior merit of shrubby plants. The colours 
and the markings of the calceolaria are be- 
coming exceedingly numerous; and, within the 
last two years, they have been diverted from 
their general characteristic in an extraordi- 
nary manner, and from speckles and blotches 
of ail forms and sizes, they have produced 
blossoms with stripes like a carnation, rami- 
fying from the hollow which is at the top, like 
rays from a centre, to the outer edge. The 
chief blemishes of these have been a dulness 
and indefiniteness in their colours and stripes. 
Nevertheless, there is no doubt, like all other 
subjects taken up in earnest, they will be 
improved ; they have, too, the prevailing fault 
of deep notches in the outline. The herba- 
ceous kinds are what florists technically call 
'* miffy," a term denoting easily killed or 
damaged by mismanagement. The shrubby 
ones are more hardy and easily managed. 
"We succeeded well for some years by the fol- 
lowing treatment. 

SOIL. 

The compost we used was clean hazel loam, 
which, when ordinarily damp, but not wet, we 
could squeeze into a mass, and lay it down on 
the potting table without breaking, but which 
a pressure of the finger would crumble again 
readily. To two parts of this, we put one of 
leaf mould, one of mould formed by a rotten 
melon bed of stable dung, and one of Wim- 
bledon peat— this being merely lumps of half- 
decomposed wiry fibre and sandy earth, was 
rubbed through a coarse sieve, such as would 
lefc horse beans through. The loam, and dung, 
and leaf mould were sifted through the same 
sieve, and the whole well amalgamated, and 
often turned for some time. It should be 
mentioned, perhaps, that all these should bp 
measured after they have been passed through 
the sieve, for one of them may have, and the 
peat especially, a good deal left behind, which 
would, of course, considerably affect the pro- 
portions. This soil is not too retentive of 
moisture ; and then requires that all plants 
grown in it should be very carefully watched 
and watered. When the soil is required for 
repotting large plants, or to grow them with 
very large shifts from small to large pots, the 
sieve used may be coarser, large enough in 



the mesh to let a marble through. Some cul- 
tivators were using at the same time, and 
with equal success, three instead of two parts 
of loam ; but very much depends on the 
quality of the loam, which, if heavier or 
of a more tenacious natui-e than we have 
described, should be rather lessened in 
quantity. 

CHOICE OF PLANTS. 

As there is no method of choosing plants 
equal to that of selecting those in bloom, the 
following points should be attended to as much 
as possible. First, that the plant be of shrubby 
habit, the stems being woody and well clothed 
with foliage, branching well, and forming a 
bushy shrub on a small scale. Secondly, 
that the flower stems should not rise too high 
above the foliage, for it would be desirable 
that no bare stalks should be seen between 
the leafy shrub and the flowers. Thirdly, 
that the flowers should have footstalks of such 
length as to display the bloom to advantage, 
without being crowded or too far apart. 
Fourthly, that the flowers should be smooth 
and full, like a small distended bladder, not 
flattened, nor indented like a melon, perfectly 
round in the outline whichever way it is 
viewed. Fifthly, that the colours should be 
bright or dense, which gives richness; that 
any marks or blotches should be well defined, 
and the ground colour as good at the back as 
the front. Sixthly, that so far as is consistent 
with these points, the largest flowers should 
be chosen. But with regard to the roundness 
and the freedom from indenture, so large a 
majority of the present varieties are deficient 
in these respects, that all we can do is to pick 
those which are the most round and the least 
indented, and be satisfied with those that are 
the nearest to the standard we require. This 
selection should be made without regard to 
names or price, for, like the varieties of many 
other subjects, the dearest are not by any 
means always the best. If, however, we de- 
sire plants before they bloom, the only points 
we can choose are those which relate to the 
habit of the plant, which, if handsome when 
small, will rarely grow worse as it increases 
in size. We may consult the last published 
authority for the best names, or take the re- 
commendation of a respectable florist, (and 
we ought never to deal with any other,) for 
the number we require, first letting him per- 
fectly understand the points we wish to secure. 
Nor must we be disappointed if the collection 
contain some which approach our standard at 
a very humble distance. The Garden Alma- 
nac for 1847, gives us a list of the best 
new ones : — Masterpiece, Puissant, Julia, 
Emperor, Oscar, Lord Hardinge, Marmion, 
Marquetry, Matchless, Orlando, and Plant's 



GLENN Y ON THE CALCEOLARIA.

Carnation stripes, and there is no doubt they 
are the best exhibited ; but some of them are 
mentioned for their colour, some for their 
habits, some for their form, and some for 
their novelty. There are older ones which equal 
them, such as the Mr. Kinghorn's best half 
dozen, and Mr. Standish's best three or four, 
which may be had, as well by that distinction, 
as by their names. These plants, obtained 
early in spring, will be best retained in their 
pots until their fibres reach the side ; or if, on 
examining them, their balls are at all full of 
roots, they should be at once shifted. 

REPOTTING OR SHIFTING. 

Procure pots one or two sizes larger than 
those the plants are in ; for instance, if they are 
in the pots called large sixties, they may be 
shifted either to the size called forty-eights, or 
the next size, called thirty-twos. We, for the 
sake of their taking less room, prefer only 
one size larger, and should use forty-eights. 
Give the new pot some broken potsherds or 
crocks at the bottom, say an inch or an inch 
and a half deep ; then put enough compost in 
the pot to bring the ball even with the top of 
the pot without pressing. If the roots have 
grown about the crocks in the original pot, do 
not disturb them to hurt the roots ; but when 
the ball is turned out, rub off the soil from 
the top surface a little, but not enough to dis- 
turb the fibres ; then set it in the centre of 
the pot into which it is to be placed, press it 
down a little into the soil already there, so 
that the collar of the plant is just below the 
level of the top edge of the pot ; with the 
hand fill up the vacancy all round, shaking it 
gently down, by knocking the bottom of the 
pot down on the potting table or bench, and, 
if necessary, gently pressing it down at the 
sides, by a piece of stick of a proper thick- 
ness, not to touch the fibres which are round 
the outside of the ball ; then, placing a little 
of the compost on the top, wiiich should be 
about as high as the edge of the pot, finishes 
the operation. 

The plant should be placed in a cold pit, or 
even a common garden frame, on a dry bot- 
tom, impervious to wet, so that the water that 
runs through the pots will not soak into the 
ground, but run off altogether ; and they 
should be covered with the lights close for 
two or three days, being first watered gently, 
but thoroughly, to settle the earth to the 
roots. If the frame be like those for the cul- 
ture of ordinary melons and cucumbers, only 
one board thick, it will be as well to heap up 
earth all round, like a bank, providing, how- 
ever, by some means, for the running off of 
the superabundant water ; and the greatest 
care must be taken to cover them from frost 
and cold winds, with matting or transparent 



cloth ; for the plant, though half-hardy, will 
be easily damaged with frost, if in a growing 
state, and cannot be too carefully guarded 
against it, although it requires no heat. 
Many who have a greenhouse, place them on 
some of the shelves, in preference to growing 
them in pits ; but, where there is so much 
space, there is more danger of frost, unless 
artificial heat be given in hard weather ; and 
the Calceolaria does not thrive so well, nor 
grow so handsome in heat ; they are apt to 
draw, and it is the very last plant that should 
be at all drawn, on account of its spoiling the 
habit and appearance, and weakening the 
flower stems. It is necessary to keep them 
near the glass, and it is almost impossible to 
have them too near. Besides, plants in frames 
or pits are so well under the eye, and we can 
so much better see when they require water. 

WATERING AND GIVING AIR. 

Although the Calceolaria is, with care, 
among the easiest-managed subjects, that care 
must not be withheld, for it is the most liable 
to damage by the least neglect. Too much 
water will damp them off quickly ; too little 
will destroy them, or hand them over to the red 
spider, which almost instantaneously attacks 
an unhealthy plant. The compost should 
never become dry, and, except when the plants 
are growing rapidly, not too often watered ; 
there is never, or at any rate, there is rarely, 
sufficient attention paid to this important 
operation. It is almost destructive to omit 
watering one hour longer than the time they 
ought to have it. In mild weather the lights 
should be taken off; and this is the time 
when, if the weather be dry, the moisture 
rapidly passes off, and requires renewal. On 
the other hand, in cloudy or dull, though mild 
weather, the moisture may be retained for a 
long time. It should never be thought too 
much trouble to turn out a plant, to examine 
the state of the soil and the roots. The great- 
est danger of suffering from wet is in the 
winter and early spring months. The greatest 
danger of suffering from want of water is 
after the spring growth commences in earnest, 
and the flower stems begin their work ; for 
the plant takes up a good deal of moisture, 
and the roots get near the side of the pot. 
If the weather be very foggy or damp, the 
framec are better covered up with the glasses 
quite close, but not darkened with mats or 
cloths, unless there is frost, or danger of it. 
The frames should not be opened in windy 
weather, unless the air be mild. In the spring 
months, if there be a genial shower, the lights 
may be removed, that the plants may have the 
benefit of it. One precaution is very neces- 
sary in the application of water 5 it always 
ought to be of fully equal temperature with 
h2

the atmosphere ; and, if it be not so naturally, 
which is seldom the case, unless it be exposed 
to the sun in shallow vessels, it ought to be 
made so by putting a little warm water into 
the waterpot, so as to raise the tempera- 
ture a little. Water kept in a heated house 
vould do ; but tliere is no way so simple as to 
put a little heated water to the quantity you 
are using. Many plants suffer greatly from 
the chill given by pump and other cold water, 



when they are sending forth their young 
growth. 

SHADING. 

As the warm days advance, the full power 
of the sun would be injurious to the plants, 
and rapidly dry up and heat the soil in the 
pots. To prevent this, a thin or transparent 
cloth should be used, that will not exclude the 
light, but yet keep off the power of the sun ; 
as the plants however want air, the glasses 




should be propped up at all four corners with 
blocks of wood, or bricks, or flower-pots, or 
some other contrivance which will allow the 
air to pass freely over all the plants ; and the 
shading is only to be continued in the strongest 
heat of the day. At morning and evening, 
when the power is not great, they may have 
the benefit of it with the glasses off, until the 
period when the colour of the flowers begins to 
show, when they must be still more carefully 
protected against sun. 

TREATMENT TO THE TEME OF BLOOMING. 

In the spring, when the plants begin to grow 
the pots rapidly fill with roots, and it will be 
necessary to examine them, by turning out 
the balls of two or three occasionally, to see 
how far they may require shifting to larger 
pots, from 48's to 32's. The operation has 
to be performed in a manner precisely similar 
to that of the first shift from 60's to 48's, and 
they must be treated in all respects the same. 



In a comparatively short time even these will 
be filled with roots ; if the plants, from their 
size, require one shift more, the state of the 
roots must be examined as before recom- 
mended, and the shifting will be just the same 
as well as the treatment afterwards. As the 
stems rise for bloom they may require support, 
but proper habited plants will not, unless they 
are drawn up. If, however, for the purpose 
of travelling or for exhibition tying up be- 
comes necessary, it should be done with very 
slight twigs of osier, with the bark on, and 
as soon as the flowers begin to swell and take 
their places in their bunches : the twig should 
reach above the flowers and be tied loosely, 
for the stems would grow, and if confined, 
would be bent, unless the tie were loose enough 
to slip up with the growth. As the blooms 
develope themselves, it is the fashion to put 
the plants in a house, but shading and plenty 
of air must be attended to as usual, and plenty 
of water must be aiven. According to the size 



GLENN Y ON THE CALCEOLARIA. 



101 



of the plants, so must the pots be increased in 
size as fast as the roots fill up the old ones ; 
and a continuance of watering, giving air, and 
shading, will bring them to perfection. 

SEEDS AND SEEDLINGS. 

The plants destined for seeding should be 
placed together in the open ground, or in a pit 

which can be altogether uncovered when neces- 
sary. If it be intended to fertilize one particu- 
lar kind with another, take a camel's hair pen- 
cil, to collect the dust of the one, and brush the 
pistil of the other with the camel's hair pencil, 
and the dust will stick to the female organ of 
the plant ; but it is far better to place such as 
are considered good together in one place, and 
let them fertilize themselves. Cover them 
against excessive rains, because they are un- 
favourable to the seeding of anything, but in 
an ordinary season they will seed plentifully ; 
and all that is necessary is to place none for 
seed that have not any distinct characters, and 
very desirable ones, so that any kind of mix- 
ture may bring two good properties together in 
one flower, which are at the beginning in two 
separate ones. The seed must be gathered 
carefully as it approaches ripeness, and the 
pods be placed in a paper under cover, where 
it will not be prematurely laid by in a damp 
or unripe state. It is better to gather it before 
it actually turns brown, because it ripens as 
"veil for a week on the stems cut off, when 

race it is full grown, as it would on the plant. 

When once dried well it may be sowed in 
pans or boxes or large-mouthed pots, thinly 
and evenly, and be placed in the greenhouse, 
or in the pit, and covered with a bell glass 
until it comes up ; providing at all times for 
sufficient moisture to prevent the seed from 
drying again after having swelled. It should 
also be shaded from the heat of the sun. Upon 
the whole, the seed, when sown, would be better 
in a greenhouse, covered however, with a hand 
or bell glass, and kept merely a little moistened 
by watering with a very fine rose or a patent 
syringe, for the water should fall in very fine 
particles like dew, as the seed would be dis- 
placed by it. When the seeds come up they 
should be carefully shaded, and the glass 
should be taken off by day, and put on again at 
night. A simple and effective shade is to 
merely cover the side of the glass next the sun 
with a piece of paper ; it keeps off the bright 
and burning heat without materially affecting 
the light. When the plants fairly set off grow- 
ing, the bell or hand glass may be removed 
altogether ; and as soon as the plants are large 
enough to handle, they may be pricked out, 
in wide-mouthed pots, an inch apart, beginning 
a row close to the edge and working inwards ; 
a pot will hold a good many plants this way. 
After a very gentle watering with a fine rose or 



syringe, they should be covered with a glass 
and placed within sight near the window in 
the greenhouse, or in the pit ; the glass must 
be kept over them till they have fairly estab- 
lished themselves, when it may be taken off, 
and they may grow until they pretty well 
touch each other. When they have become 
strong, and the foliage nearly covers the pot, 
they may be placed one each in the large sixty 
size pots, and be set in a frame, and after 
watering them, to settle the compost about their 
roots, they may be shut up close for a day or 
two ; they must be now shaded from the 
violent heat of the sun for a while, but when 
they have once got hold again, and established 
their roots, all the care required is to see 
they are well and frequently watered in hot 
weather. They will show their habits very 
early, and if we were growing them we should 
throw away all that showed they were her- 
baceous, for to say the truth, we do not value 
them more than we should a single pink or a 
double polyanthus. If the pots fill with roots 
towards the winter time, the changing to 
larger ones had better be deferred to the period 
at which they begin to grow again, as they 
can hardly be kept better than at rest during 
the severe weather— if there be any. As the 
early spring approaches, they may be all 
shifted into 48 sized pots ; or if there are more 
than can be conveniently grown in pots, they 
may be held back, or a portion of the least 
promising habits may be held back, to bed 
out or put in the borders. The treatment, in 
short, of the seedling plants when once they 
have been raised, up to the filling of the small 
pots, may be assimilated to that already given 
for other plants. 

SELECTING FROM SEEDLINGS. 

We cannot do better than refer the reader 
back to the instructions for the choice of plants 
when in flower ; for as he would pick from the 
stock of others for his own garden, so ought he 
to select from the stock of seedlings such as 
are worth cultivation, and throw or give all 
the rest away. Indeed, as the flowers come 
out, all that are good for nothing should be 
cast out the instant they are discovered, that 
they may not spoil the seed of the better ones 
by inoculation. 

TREATMENT OF PLANTS AFTER BLOOM. 

The branches should be cut back a little into 
form, the useless or thin wiry shoots cut out, 
the plants cleansed, the top surface of the com- 
post stirred and thrown out, and a fresh top- 
dressing put on. They may then stand in 
their frames, receiving pretty nearly all the 
weather, except the most violent of the rains 
and east winds, until September, when they 
must be deprived of more wet than is absolutely 



102 



GLENNY ON THE CALCEOLARIA. 



necessary, and be secured against frost. As 
the plants enlarge, they will require other 
pots, but they may enjoy a period of com- 
parative rest from the end of October till they 
make a fresh move in the early spring ; 
however, plants of good shrubby habits do not 
actually stop growing at all. Before they are 
shut up for the winter, the surface should be 
stirred, the loose mould shook off, and the pots 
filled up level ; they will scarcely want water- 
ing all the winter, unless it be unusually bright 
and warm. 

SPRING SHIFTING. 

The established plants and seedlings alike 
require to be removed to larger pots as soon 
as there are any symptoms of making new 
growth, that is, presuming the pots are full of 
fibres, or at least that these have reached the 
side. The sized pots in which they are to be 
placed must depend on the size they are re- 
moved from ; from 60's to 48's, from 48's to 
32's, from 32's to 24's, from 24's to 16's, 
and 16's to 12's, which is large enough to 
carry a very handsome well-grown specimen. 
The mode of shifting has been described. 

CUTTINGS. 

In going over all the plants, to see that there 
are no useless shoots left on, many will be 
found that may be removed, by merely 
breaking them off from the base ; very small 
ones will answer all the purposes of propaga- 
tion. Those who require many will grow a 
few plants pretty hard after blooming, to in- 
duce shoots on purpose to take off, but any 
small pieces will strike readily in the ordinary 
compost, with a quarter of an inch of silver 
sand at top. The cuttings must be put in so 
as to touch the compost, but not to go into it, 
and the sand will always protect them from the 
air by working down close every time it is 
watered. They should be covered with a bell- 
glass, that touches all round the inside of the 
edge of the pot ; but, as most cuttings strike 
more readily when placed close round the 
edge, so as to touch the pot, it is better to fill 
a pot with cuttings all round the edge, and to 
place this pot inside another, with a good 
inch of room all round ; the bell-glass resting 
upon the soil, which must be filled in between 
the two pots. The object of the glass is to 
exclude drafts of air, and prevent evaporation 
from taking place too rapidly. A slight 
bottom heat will facilitate the striking, but 
the glass must be wiped dry inside every day, 
and the soil kept moist, for if once the cut- 
tings become dry, they would stand a poor 
chance of recovering. In a few weeks the 
cuttings will begin to grow, which is a pretty 
safe indication of their having struck, and 
when they have acquired some strength of 



root, they may be potted off carefully, one in 
each pot, which may be the smallest or thumb 
pot, or the first recognised size called 60's. 
They should be closed up in a frame a day 
or two, and then submitted to the treatment 
already described for plants brought in, which, 
with some varieties, are rarely more than a 
struck cutting in its first separate pot. 

The following hints refer to the general 
features of the cultivation of the Calceolaria, 
during the year : — 

January. — The plants should now be in 
pits, which can be well protected against frost, 
but not heated artificially. They should have 
little or no water, nor should they be un- 
covered during a frost. If the weather be 
mild and damp, let them have all the air they 
can get, by uncovering them altogether ; if, 
on the contrai'y, there be wind, they must 
only have air given by propping the lights on 
the side or end, on the fair weather side. 
Generally speaking, the plants should have as 
little water during the winter months as 
can be given to keep them from quite flag- 
ging. Towards the end of the month the 
plants will begin to grow. "Watch closely for 
green fly, and upon the slightest indication of 
its presence, fumigate with tobacco or tobacco 
paper. 

February. — This month the surface of all 
the soil in the pots that are large enough, may 
be stirred as low as it can be done without 
disturbing the fibres, and thrown out to make 
room for a top-dressing of leaf-mould and 
cow-dung perfectly decomposed; with this top- 
dressing, towards the end of the month, and 
a gentle watering, if well covered up for a day, 
the plants will set off growing ; and when 
there is no frost or cold winds, let the glasses 
be quite off. Cover up carefully at night, 
and also in cold weather. Seeds may be sown. 

March. — Continue the treatment of last 
month. Propagate by cuttings when they 
can be taken ; they ought to consist of the 
young shoots when two inches long. All the 
plants which are in pots that are filled with 
roots and require shifting, should be carefully 
turned out and put from 60's to 48's, from 
48's to 32's, or 24's, and from this to 16's, 
carefully keeping the surface of the soil close, 
but not above the collar of the plant : after 
shifting, they must be watered and shut up 
one day. Look out still for green fly, and 
destroy them before they can get a head. 
Sow seed in wide-mouthed pots ; scatter it very 
thinly. Pot off the seedling plants. 

April. — Give plenty of air and pay great 
attention to watering. Propagate by cuttings. 
As we do not encourage herbaceous varieties, 
we are almost unwilling to give a hint about 
them ; but as they soon throw up thin, long 



GLENNY ON 1HZ CALCEOLARIA, 



103 



awkward flower stems, they must be supported 
in time by sticks, which should be small, and 
the ties must be rather loose, to allow the 
growing stem to push the tie up with it. The 
plants now require a good deal of water, 
as the weather becomes warm ; gentle showers 
are good for them. 

May. — Propagate by cuttings still, when 
any nice young shoots can be taken off without 
spoiling the plants ; as they continue growing 
and advancing for bloom, they are more in 
want of moisture, and should never be al- 
lowed to get dry ; they also require all the 
air that can be given; they may be removed 
to the greenhouse, either for ornament or con- 
venience, but until they become large, the 
pits are more handy. Supporting the stems 
will be found necessary with some varieties, 
but the good shrubby kinds will not require 
it except for travelling. Encourage seedling 
plants. Look closely after the green fly. 
Bed out at the end of the month, small plants 
for the open air. 

June. — Most of the well grown plants 
will now be flowering ; they will still require 
plenty of moisture, and the sun must be kept 
off with thin canvass shading. In pits the 
lights should be tilted on all four corners, and 
the canvass thrown over them in the heat of 
the day ; and if they are in the green-house, 
there must be some kind of shade or the 
blooms will soon fall or fade. Cuttings that 
are struck, may be potted off, and the sooner 
the better. Prick out seedlings an inch apart 
in pots, beginning round the edge. Watch 
the green fly, for if left undisturbed for a 
few days they would destroy the beauty of a 
plant. 

JuLr. — Cuttings may be still potted off, and 
any that have filled their small pots with roots 
may be shifted to others a size larger. The 
principal business now is to shade the bloom- 
ing plants, keep them well watered and 
drained, and supported where it is necessary. 
Seedlings that are up and growing in their 
seed-pots may be pricked out, an inch apart, 
as soon as they are large enough, in wide- 
mouthed pots, or if in small pots put round 
the edge only. Shift any that are in pots too 
small. Put together, in an isolated place, for 
seeding such distinct varieties as you wish to 
amalgamate. 

August. — Propagate, by cuttings, all this 
month. "Water freely. Remove such as are 
past their prime into the open air, to encourage 
the seeds, and be careful that they do not 
suffer for want of water. Seed, also, must be 
examined as it approaches ripeness, and be 
gathered before it is scattered. Shift seedlings 
that are large enough into small pot3, one in 
a pot, and after watering them in, to close the 
earth about their roots, shut them up a day in 



a pit well shaded. Continue to watch for the 
green fly, and exterminate it with fumigation. 
September. — Propagate by cuttings all 
this month, attending to their different stages, 
as before. Continue to gather seed. Pot off 
seedlings and cuttings that are ready, and 
shift those that are pot-bound. Cut down the 
bloom stems ; stir the surface of the mould in 
the pots ; top-dress a little, and set them in 
their frames for the winter. See that the 
bottom of the frame is hard and sound, and 
rather sloping, so as not to let water lay on it, 
nor soak into it. Lessen the quantity of mois- 
ture given to the plants, as they will not be 
growing much, and there is, after the middle 
of the month, danger of frost. 

October. — Continue the treatment of the 
past month, but be more careful, and provide 
against frost, by covering at night. Pot off 
any of the best or previous month's cuttings 
that have struck, and shut them down close for 
a day or two after moving. Also, pot off 
seedlings, or prick out the small ones, and 
place them in the greenhouse until they are 
large enough to put in separate pots. Give no 
water now, while the plants keep fresh, for 
there is very little moisture wanted. 

November. — The treatment throughout 
the autumn and winter months is not materially 
changed : — all the air that can be given in mild 
weather, very little moisture, and secure cover- 
ing from frost; and whether they are in regular 
pits or frames, or in a greenhouse, the same 
treatment must be observed as nearly as pos- 
sible ; nor must it be forgotten, that frost does 
not prevent the green-fly from attacking these 
plants, although there is less danger of them in 
winter time than in spring and summer. 

December. — A continuation of more watch- 
fulness, to carry out the general principles al- 
ready laid down. The inside of the pits should 
be kept dry and clean; all dead leaves should be 
constantly picked off and thrown away, and by 
no means be left in the pit. Water should be 
seldom given, and never until the soil is nearly 
dry. 

THE KINL-S TO SELECT. 

A very minute description of each separate 
variety would have a great degree of sameness; 
for the variety is occasioned by the different 
shapes of the spots as much as anything. We 
therefore give a list of the sorts we should buy 
to begin with, and should then be content to 
take in addition any that appeared better in 
blooming time, but none that were worse : —

GLENNY ON THE CALCEOLARIA. 



Stripes ; which last is a singular strain, entirely 
run away from all the others. 

THE PROPERTIES OP THE CALCEOLARIA. 

The plant should be shrubby ; the habit 
bushy; the wood strong ; the foliage thick and 
dark green. 

The flower-stem should be short and strong; 
and the footstalks of the blooms elastic, and 
branching well away from each other, to form 
a rich mass of flowers, without crowding. 
The individual flower depends entirely on 
the form of the purse ; it should be a perfect 
round hollow ball ; the orifice and calyx can- 
not be too small, nor the flower too large. 



The colour should be very dense ; whether 
the marking be a spot in the middle, or stripes, 
or blotches, it should be well defined ; the 
ground should be all one colour, whether 
white, straw, sulphur, yellow, or any other 
colour. 

The colour of a self should be brilliant, and 
all over of the same actual shade ; dark flowers 
with pale edges, or clouded and indefinite 
colours, are bad and unfit for show. 

The bloom should form one handsome 
bunch of pendent flowers, commencing where 
the foliage leaves off ; the flower- stems should 
not be seen between the foliage and the flowers, 
which latter should hang gracefully, and be 




|pP— 



close to each other ; the brandies of the 
flower-stems holding them so as to form a 
handsome spreading surface. 

We cannot well give the properties of this 
flower without acknowledging that Mr. Green 
has written on the same subject. We are not 
surprised that we differ from him upon the 
most essential points. This comes of our 
wanting flowers better than they have been 
yet produced ; and of growers taking their 
own best for a model, and making, or rather 
endeavouring to make them patterns for all 
future growers. There is no good reason why 
the Calceolaria should not be as round as a 
cherry. The error which most people fall into 
in settling the points of a florist's flower is, 
that they are guided by what has been done, 



instead of what would look the most hand- 
some if it could be accomplished. 

MR. GREEN'S PROPERTIES. 

The properties which constitute perfection 
in the Calceolaria, consist in the lip forming a 
perfect circle, even round the edges, not flat, 
but raised in the centre, presenting a bold 
convex surface. 

In all cases the colours should be clear and 
! distinct, with the dark markings having a rich 
I velvety appearance; the petals and calyx ought 
! to be large and full, with the flower-stems 
J short and strong. 

The shrubby kinds are much the best ; the 
flowers are quite as large and as beautiful as 
the herbaceous sorts ; and they are much easier 
of cultivation.

General Directions. — The above lists and 
the dryness of the soil will alike indicate that 
the busy season is at hand, and of course show 
the necessity of the utmost activity. This 
month is also a good time to mark where drains 
are most required, by observing the indication 
of wetness, as shown by the damp places being 
slow in drying, which, if to be done this season, 
must be done immediately. Hoe in every 
part; complete the general digging, trenching, 
making of edgings, &c. 

Artichokes {Globe). — Prick out those sown 
last month, and still keep them in a gentle 
heat. Make new plantations of suckers from 



the old stools ; plant them at four feet between 
the rows, and two feet apart, in an open, deep, 
rich, and moist soil, watering until they take 
root, if the weather is diy. Thin out the old 
stools to three of the strongest shoots : dig in 
neatly the material with which they were 
protected, and add a little sea-weed, as manure, 
if at hand. 

Artichokes (Jerusalem). — Plant upon 
trenched or deeply dug ground, at three feet 
apart and one foot in the row, in a light rich 
soil. The smaller roots may be planted whole. 

Asparagus. — Sow on a rich soil about the 
middle of the month, in drills two inches deep 
and fifteen apart. New plantations can still 
be made, but many prefer May and June. 
Loosen and dress the surface of the old beds, 
working in two inches of good rotten dung or 
seaweed with the points of the digging fork, 
which should be inserted in a slanting direction, 
and raking the hard clods and stones into the 
alleys. In showery weather sow common salt 
over the beds. 

Angelica. — If not sown in autumn, should 
be done now ; transplant young plants into a 
moist soil, three feet apart. 

Anise. — Sow in a light dry soil in the 
warmest part of the garden, say along the 
bottom of the south -wall. 

Balm. — Plant in common garden mould, 
one foot apart ; it is increased by division of 
the roots. 

Basil, which was early sown, should be 
pricked off in pots or boxes into a light rich 
soil, and kept in a gentle heat : make another 
sowing in heat at the end of the month.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MARCH. 



Beans. — Earth up the advancing crops, and 
if any were sown thickly and raised in heat 
they may now be planted out : plant a main 
crop at the end of the month. 

Beet. — Sow the main crops upon a deep, 
rich, and sandy soil, in drills fifteen inches 
apart, and one inch deep, about the end of the 
month. 

Borecole. — Under this head are included all 
the kinds of kale. Sow at the end of the month : 
those which proved to be fine curled sorts 
transplant to a good situation to be preserved 
for seeds. 

Borage is usually self-sown, but if not thus 
to be depended on, scatter a few seeds in any 
spare corner ; when in flower, it is valuable 
for bees. 

Brocoli. — Sow early for autumn crops ; the 
purple sprouting and Snow's early white are 
suitable. The main crops may be sown at the 
end of the month. Protect the seeds from 
birds, by netting or branches, and the young 
plants from cutting winds. Go over the old 
plantations regularly, and cut the heads before 
they begin to open, taking care, when they are 
wanted to be kept for a few days, to cut them 
six or e ; ght inches below the flower, which 
makes it easy to preserve them : remove the 
roots of those cut, totally from the ground. 

Brussels Sprouts. — Preserve seme of the 
plants which prove to be superior for seed : 
sow at the end of the month, in a good rich 
soil. 

Burnet. — Sow a little in a shady situation; 
or increase it by division of the roots, and plant 
nine inches apart. 

Cabbages, for use in summer, must be sown 
early ; keep each kind distinct. Plant out the 
autumn sowings, the dwarf sorts about fifteen 
inches apart ; it is a good plan to make drills 
with the hoe, in which to plant them, and 
draw the earth to that side from which the 
cutting winds proceed. 

Caraway. — Sow a little at the end of the 
month ; the young leaves are used in soups. 

Carrots. — Thin out partially the early 
sowings, as many will soon be drawn for use. 
Sow in the beginning of the month on a warm 
border ; the main crops defer until the end. 
Have the ground thoroughly wrought : the 
soil should be deep, rich, and of a sandy 
nature ; choose a calm day for sowing ; the 
seed is usually rubbed amongst sand to sepa- 
rate it, but this is not imperative ; sow in 
drills fifteen inches apart, and trample or roll 
in the seed. 

Cauliflower. — If no spring sowing has yet 
been made, do it immediately (in a slight heat), 
to succeed the autumn sowings : prick out the 
early plants, and forward them under glass. 
The wintered plants should be put out at the 
end of the month : thin out those under hand- 



lights to two or three plants ; air profusely : 
should the weather be unfavourable, defer 
planting out. Those which are in pots, and 
appear to be confined, may be shifted into a 
larger size, and kept growing, otherwise they 
are apt to button. 

Celery. — Sow early in a slight hot-bed ; 
cover very slightly : prick out into another 
frame when about two inches high ; give air 
freely. Use a rich soil in all stages of 
growth. 

Chamomile. — This useful medicinal plant is 
easily increased by division or cuttings ; they 
will grow readily in any common soil. 

Chervil. — Sow a little in any spare corner; 
it requires to be sown monthly for succession. 

Chives. — Plant in any common soil ; in- 
crease by division of the roots : plant it as an 
edging or in a bed, a few inches apart : it is 
very useful for spring salads. 

Clary. — Sow in a bed, if not done last 
month, in any common mould ; it is not much 
used. 

Coriander. — If not sown last month, may 
be got in now ; give it rather a good situation 
and a fresh soil. 

Cumin. — Sow a small bed in any open 
situation ; it is not much used. 

Cress. — Sow towards the end, in an open 
border ; the early sowing will be much assisted 
by being protected with hand glasses ; grow it 
as quickly as possible ; double the quantity of 
cress, compared with mustard, will be found 
proportionate. 

Dill is best sown in autumn, but may now 
succeed very well ; sow a small quantity in a 
light soil. 

Fennel. — Sow early in shallow drills, from 
six to ten inches apart ; a few plants will be 
found sufficient ; thin them to sixteen inches 
apart : or increase by division. 

Feverfew. — Sow in a light soil, and trans- 
plant to a foot apart ; in addition to its me- 
dicinal qualities, it makes a showy border 
flower. 

Garlic may still be planted in drills two 
inches deep, ten apart, and six between the 
roots : hoe the autumn planting. 

FCerbs generally may be sown, and increased 
by division of the roots this month : it is in 
many respects desirable that a piece of ground 
be exclusively devoted to them. 

Horehound. — Sow at the end, in a dry 
situation, either in beds or drills, a foot apart 
and an inch deep. 

Horse-radish. — Plantations may still be 
formed ; and as the ground is levelled, a sowing 
of radish, lettuce, or cress may be made. 

Hyssop. — Sow on a border in a fight mould, 
covering slightly ; it may also be increased 
now by division of the roots, by cuttings, or 
by slips. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MARCH. 



107 



Kidney -leans. — Although no dung need be 
used for this crop, the soil must be rich and 
well wrought, also dry ; a few may be planted 
at the end of the month in a very warm spot. 

Lavender — Increase by cuttings and slips ; 
the common garden soil will suit it. 

Leeks. — Sow any time this month , give 
them an open spot, and a deep rich soil. 

Lettuce. — Sow at the end, on a well-worked 
piece of ground ; the seed may be trodden in 
if the soil is dry. Plant out a few by the side 
of the wall from those under glass, and give 
air freely to those in frames. 

Love Apples.'— Sow a little in a pan, in a 
slight heat, at the end of the month. 

Marjoram. — The perennial sorts may be 
increased by division, if required ; prick off 
the annuals sown last month and forward in 
a slight heat. 

Milan Cabbage. — Sow at the end of this 
month, on a warm spot, on a dry and light 
soil for transplanting. 

Mint. — Divide the roots, planting them in 
drills, a foot a part ; any common place will 
suit it. It should be replanted often. 

Mustard must be sown twice for once of 
cress : it may be sown on a warm border ex- 
ternally ; if frosted, sprinkle it with water, 
and keep it shaded from the sun. 

New Zealand Spinach. — Sow in a slight 
heat, near the end of the month, and after- 
wards pot them, to be ready to plant out in 
April. 

Nasturtiums. — Sow at the end of the month, 
in heat, and plant out next month, in a situa- 
tion where beauty and utility may be com- 
bined. They make good temporary fences. 

Onions. — The soil can scarcely be too rich : 
a successful mode of dunging is, to have the 
ground levelled, and then spread the dung, 
covering it very slightly with soil. Main 
crops should be put in by the end of the 
month ; sow in drills a foot apart, and one 
inch deep, and trample it in if the soil is suffi- 
ciently dry. Hoe the autumn sowings, and 
when drawing them for use, do it so as to 
thin the plants; pull out those not likely to 
bulb well. 

Parsley, if not already sown, should be 
got in : when thinning early sowings, take 
out first the uncurled roots. 

Parsnips. — Sow early, on a deeply trenched 
sandy soil ; let the drills be shallow, and 
fifteen inches apart. 

Peas. — Choose still a sheltered spot for the 
stated sowings, which should be at least every 
three weeks. Earth up and stake the early 
sowings, which serves for protection, and 
should be done early. The drills should be 
two and a half feet apart for the dwarf sorts, 
and three and four for the taller sorts, making 
them broad in the bottom, so as to have the 



peas sown thin and wide apart. Plant out 
those which have been forwarded in heat, but 
they must be well hardened previously; earth 
and stake them immediately. 

Peppermint is increased by division of tlie 
roots ; plant it in shallow trenches, and the 
rows a foot apart : common garden soil will 
grow it well. 

Potatoes. — Those in frames must have 
plenty of air. Main crops should now be 
planted, preferring a light rather than a heavy 
soil ; planting uncut sets, only thinning out 
the weakest eyes ; and using manure of a 
simple nature, as leaf mould. Seed may be 
sown now, in a frame, which would come 
early. Keep turning the store roots. 

Purslane. — At the end of the month, a 
small bed may be sown on a warm border. 

Radishes. — Continue to sow successionally 
in a moist sandy loam. Sowings are often 
made amongst different crops, as they can be 
soon drawn for use, but it is not advisable. 

Rampion should be sown in August, but 
it may be put in now with success : it is used 
as radishes, and is in use from November to 
April. 

Rape often supplies the place of mustard, 
but it is not so tender, is quite hardy, and 
may be sown early in the month. 

Rhubarb is sometimes sown and forwarded 
in heat, but this plan is not often practicable : 
sow in a bed of light rich soil, and cover about 
half an inch deep. It may also be propagated 
by slips or side shoots, and requires a deep, 
rich, sandy soil. 

Sage. — Increase by slips, putting them in 
poor sandy mould, one foot apart, and eight 
inches in the row. Seed may also be sown 
now in a sheltered border. 

Savoy. — Sow a little at the end of the 
month ; it requires a good soil. 

Salsafy requires a deep, light, and rich 
soil: sow the main crop at the end of the 
month, in drills, about fifteen inches apart. 

Scorzonera is not so apt to run to seed as 
salsafy, and may be sown about the middle 
of the month. 

Sea-kale. — Sow in drills, or broad cast, on 
a previously well-manured and moist soil ; 
when growing, water with liquid manure : use 
sea-weed as a manure. 

Shallots. — Plant immediately, if not done ; 
and to prevent the attacks of the maggot, mix 
soot with the soil. 

Skirret. — Sow in a light sandy soil, a little 
moist ; they will also succeed by cuttings of 
the root : keep it in drills a foot apart. 

Sorrel. — Make new plantations by dividing 
the roots, and planting in rows one foot apart, 
and eight inches in the row : a loamy rich soil 
suits it best. 

Spinach. — Sow about the middle of the 



108 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MARCH. 



month, and keep the hoe active amongst the 
advancing crops : if the soil is much beaten 
down, it will be well to point it with the 
spade or fork. 

Thyme. — Sow now on a sandy soil, or in- 
crease by slips or layers, planting them six 
inches apart in the row, and a foot between ; 
keep the plants rather deep planted. 

Turnip. — Sow on a warm border about the 
end of the month, and cover the bed with 
fern or branches, which will assist to ward off 
the fly at this early period better than soot : 
thin the sowing of last month. 

Wormwood is increased by slips, or by seed 
sown in autumn; either will now succeed in 
rather a rich soil : a few plants will suffice. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — All the grafting ap- 
paratus must be in readiness; also the pro- 
tecting materials at work ; and if there is any 
pruning or planting to do, it must be done 
directly. Keep the hoe active in every part, 
serving as it does to counteract the effects of 
drought, to open the soil to the benefit of the 
atmospheric gases and to prevent weeds from 
gaining any ascendency. 

Fruit-room. — Carefully pick out the de- 
caying fruit, and keep the room as cool and 
close as possible, also very clean. 

Grafting. — This operation may be pro- 
ceeded with by the end of the month. 

Almonds. — Treat much as the peach : it is 
found to succeed best grafted on the plum stock. 
Particular care is necessary to protect the 
blossoms from frost, as non-success chiefly 
arises from neglect of this. The sweet almond 
should be planted on a south aspect, in a loamy 
soil ; the litter almond flourishes in a light 
earth. 

Apples. — Graft chiefly upon the crab stock ; 
the Paradise and French stocks are most 
eligible for dwarfs, and the former is suitable 
for a moist situation. A soft hazelly loam 
suits apples generally ; and in every case have 
a dry bottom, and plant them shallow. Keep 
down insects, to do which, no plan is so 
effectual as to destroy them the moment they 
appear. If very severe weather prevails, the 
blossom of the choice sorts must be protected. 

Apricots. — Protect the flowers, either by 
netting, canvass, or branches : should they be 
a little touched with frost, it will lessen the 
injury to keep the trees shaded during the 
day. The plum is a good stock for the 
Apricot. 

Cherries. — Fumigate, or syringe with to- 
bacco water at the first appearance of aphis 
(green fly): Scotch snuff dusted on them, will 
also cure it; and some of these may be applied 
as preventives. The wild black cherry is the 
best stock, and the pips should now be sown. 



Defend the blosf-om against severe night 
frosts. 

Cranberries must be planted on a swampy 
spot, or near the edge of a pond : artificial 
means for irrigation may easily be made; 
they will do to be planted now. 

Currants. — New plantations can now be 
made ; a rich loam, on a dry bottom, is the 
proper situation. Koe amongst the bushes, 
and cut off any branch which appears too 
low to keep the fruit clean. 

Figs. — These, if covered with spruce 
branches, as directed, will be gradually re- 
ceiving more light. If they were not nailed 
previous to being covered, they must now be 
done. In pruning, care is only required to 
thin out those leaders which have become 
hare of fruit-bearing laterals. The fig is suc- 
cessfully grown in several parts of England 
as a standard. 

Filberts. — Bed out young plants made from 
the layers, or put them in nursery rows. 
Each plant should have one strong upright 
shoot : those planted out where they are to 
bear, should be cut down to eighteen inches 
from the ground, allowing seven or eight 
shoots to grow to form the head, and keeping a 
foot of the stem perfectly clear. The soil re- 
quired is a good loam, and no dung ; and the 
plants to be about eight feet apart. 

Gooseberries. — The attacks of caterpillars 
must be guarded against, thus: — Syringe with 
a liquid of lime, sulphur, and tobacco water, 
and sprinkle the soil below with soot: gather- 
ing them with the hand is effectual : hoe and 
freshen up the soil. 

Medlars. — Old trees require no pruning : 
graft on pear stocks. 

Nectarines. — Finish pruning and nailing : 
have the blossoms defended against frosts and 
cold winds. 

Peaches. — Have these pruned and nailed, 
if not done. Protect from frost, and where 
there are flued walls, it is well, when the 
weather is very severe, to have them at work : 
it is also a good plan to have a temporary 
coping of wood, to project ten inches or so, to 
which (in addition to keeping all dry) the 
netting or canvass may be attached. Mulch 
the young trees lately planted, and if drought 
prevails, they must be watered. Plum stocks 
suit well for grafting upon, but budding 
is generally preferred. 

Pears. — Thfse often suffer from frost, and 
yet they are seldom covered. Mat, or net up 
those whose blossom is early, and if at all 
touched with frost, keep it rather dark for a 
day or two. The quince stock is frequently 
used for grafting upon, which makes young 
trees more fruitful. Cut down all the bad 
sorts and bad bearers, and graft anew with 
good sorts.

Plums which are in blossom early, should 
also be defended against frost. The weak 
blossom should be thinned out. The common 
plum is the best stock for dwarfs, and the 
Brussels for standards. 

JRaspberries. — Plantations may still be 
made upon a light and rich soil : plant them 
four feet in the row, and six feet between, 
making the rows to run north and south, so 
as to admit more sun light. 

Service-tree. — A fruit seldom seen, in the 
way of the medlar : it is propagated by layers, 
and not procurable hy seed, to be depended 
on. A common soil will suit it. 

Strawberries. — These should be thoroughly 
cleaned, and if drought prevails, they must be 
watered : by picking off the early flowers, the 
fruit may be kept longer in season, inasmuch 
as those will fruit in autumn. Make a planta- 
tion of the alpines on a north border, and 
allow them to run together ; these are easily 
procured from seed, and may be sown about 
the middle of the month, on a warm border. 

Vines may still be planted : give them a 
porous soil of fresh loam, lime rubbish, and 
decomposed dung, about eighteen inches deep 
and twelve feet broad, the whole thoroughly 
drained. The sorts best adapted for out of 
doors, are the Sweet Water, Burgundy, the 
Muscadines, Esperione, and Black Cluster. 
Plant them five feet apart, and train them up- 
r'ght : cover a foot or two of the young cane 
with the soil, which will root freely. 

Walnuts thrive in a soil of light sandy 
loam upon a dry bottom, and may yet be 
planted ; attend to mulching and watering. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Increase the amount 
of water and air : the water must always be 
of the same temperature as the place in which 
it is used ; and the air should be admitted 
chiefly by the top ventilators, and increased 
and reduced by degrees : shut up always with 
a powerful sun heat. Continue to cover up 
with mats, which should be removed eaidy. 
The late forcing houses will be benefited by 
a thorough watering and syringing. To those 
required to be very late, give air in every 
part ; and untie the trees and bend them from 
near the glass or warm part of the house to 
the bottom, where it is much cooler : at the 
same time, close the houses every night, as 
the least frost would prove detrimental. 

Asparagus. — Temperature, 60 to 65 degrees 
by day, and 50 to 55 degrees at night. Give 
more air, and should the weather prove cold, 
linings of hot dung may be applied : use 
tepid salted water when watering. 

Cherries. — Temperature, 60 degrees by 
clay, 45 to 50 degrees at night. Thin out 
the badly formed fruit, and disbud gradually. 



Syringe gently with tepid water in the morn- 
ings, especially when fine and bright. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature, 75 to 80 de- 
grees by day, 60 to 65 degrees at night. 
Syringe less as the fire heat is decreased ; still 
in stoves they will require it once a day, in 
the morning or early in the afternoon, say at 
mid-day or soon after, taking care to close 
the house at the same time. Apply liquid 
manure to those in pots, twice a week. Those 
in an advanced slate should be looked over 
every day, and pegged or tied and stopped at 
every joint, doing all in the warm part of the 
day to those in frames and pits. Pot off a 
few of those sown last month ; and at the 
end of the month sow again. The heat in dung 
frames must be kept up, by renewing the 
linings of fermenting dung; and great care is 
requisite to prevent the steam from the dung 
escaping into the frames. 

Figs. — Temperature, from 60 to 65 degrees 
by day, 50 to 55 degrees at night. Disbud, 
and stop the shoots, when about nine inches 
long. Give liberal waterings with liquid 
manure, and maintain a moist atmosphere. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature, 65 to 70 
degrees by day, 55 degrees at night. Con- 
tinue to pot off and sow for succession at least 
twice a month ; they may soon be planted out. 
Keep the plants clear of red spider and thrip 
by syringing and having the atmosphere moist. 
If these insects are upon them, kill them by 
slightly painting the flues (when cool) with 
sulphur. Use liquid manure every alternate 
watering, in strength according to the state 
and age of the plants. 

Melons. — Temperature, 80 degrees by day, 
65 to 70 degrees at night. Air daily by the 
top ventilators. Those in pits and frames 
must be regularly covered at night, and un- 
covered early if the morning is fine. Give 
fresh linings when the heat declines. Cover 
over the surface of the bed with slates, which 
will keep the vines (or stems) dry and warmer. 
Train and stop these, and impregnate the fruit 
blossoms; look over this every day: determine 
the number of leading shoots left to a plant 
by the number of plants in the bed, in any 
case eight vines (to one light), and one fruit 
of ordinary size on each, will be sufficient ; 
the very large sorts may be reduced to four. 
The fruit usually appears after the second 
stopping ; they are first stopped at the third 
or fourth joint, then at the seventh or eighth, 
and when they are impregnated stop at the 
second or third joint beyond the fruit. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature 55 to 60 degs. 
Keep the house dark. Excellent spawn will 
be found in the old beds, which can be at 
once introduced into the new beds, or may be 
laid in a corner amongst litter to increase, 
which it will soon do, and be ready for use 



no

when wanted. Cover the spawned beds with 
two inches of fresh loam, and beat it firm ; 
some use green turf with success. 

Jli/sas. — Temperature, 75 decrees by day, 
60 to 65 degrees at night. Supply these 
largely with liquid manure, and maintain a 
moist atmosphere. 

Nectarines. — Temperature, 75 degrees by 
day, 55 to 60 degrees at night. Disbud, and 
thin by degrees, allowing always the most 
promising and best placed fruit and young 
shoots to remain ; syringe twice a week in the 
mornings or very early in the afternoon. 

Oranges. — Temperature, 60 degrees by day; 
45 to 50 degrees at night. Shift all that 
require it, remove the exhausted soil from 
the roots, and replace it with a rich turfy 
loam. When they commence growing, those 
that are of unhandsome form may be cut back 
and the branches regulated. Thin the blos- 
soms ; and fumigate or syringe with tobacco 
water, on the first sign of aphides. 

Peaches. — Temperature, 70 degrees by day; 
55 degrees at night.' Continue to disbud ; 
take off first the fore right (front) and badly 
placed ones, allowing the backmost on the 
upper side of the shoot to remain, and also 
such as are situated where there is a casual 
vacancy to fill up. Thin' the fruit to one- 
third more than will ultimately remain ; 
syringe in the mornings or early in the after- 
noon, and shut up with sun heat. Pay due 
attention to the watering and airing of the 
late houses. 

Pine-apples. — Temperature, from 75 to 80 
degrees by day, and 65 degrees at night. 
Make a general shifting on the first signs of 
growth, or they may be planted out ; use for 
mould a little sandy peat, and turfy loam, 
applying what manure is necessary in a liquid 
state. Those in pots advanced to a fruiting 
state, may be assisted by turfing around the 
outer edge of the pot, and filling up with a 
rich soil around the neck of the plant. Syringe 
them occasionally, and in sunny weather, and 
shut up with a command of sun heat imme- 
diately after. 

Rhubarb. — Temperature 60 degrees. After 
being gathered, expose the crowns gradually, 
so that they may not be injured by cold, 

Salading. — Temperature, G5 to 70 degrees. 
Still sow a little in heat, which will form a re- 
serve in case cf scarcity. 

Sea-kale. — Temperature, 60 degrees. Those 
which are blanched without the protection of 
pots or boxes, must be carefully uncovered ; 
after cutting expose them gradually. 

Strawberries. — Temperature, 60 to 65 
degrees by day ; 50 to 55 degrees at night. 
Allow the sun heat to exceed that specified, 
if the fruit is required very early. Advance 
the successional crops a stage, and have them 



when in flower at a heat of 60 degrees by day; 
and 50 degrees at night. "Water plenteously 
with liquid manure, and keep all moist until 
they begin ripening. 

Vinery. — Temperature, 75 to 80 degrees 
by day ; 65 degrees at night. Admit and 
take away the air always by degrees, and 
chiefly at the top. The thermometer does 
not always indicate the real state of the house, 
and must not be the only guide. Thin the 
berries to one-third when about the size of 
small peas, or as early as possible ; the hands 
must be perfectly clean, and free of sweat ; a 
small forked stick is serviceable in turning out 
the side shoots of the branches ; these may or 
should be tied out, for which, zinc and copper 
wire is sometimes used, but most commonly 
bass matting ; stop the shoots at the second 
joint above the bunch in ordinary cases ; and 
where the shoot is weak allow it to grow fur- 
ther. Divest all of the laterals as they ap- 
pear, except when the vines are very luxu- 
riant, when they may be stopped above the 
first eye ; avoid taking oif any leaves. Let 
the syringe be only moderately used ; have no 
formal steaming, but an atmosphere almost at 
saturation, by damping every available surface, 
such as walls, floor, &c, frequently. The 
later houses, when the bunches are seen and 
until they are past flower, must be kept at a 
heat not less than 63 degrees at night, and 75 
degrees during the day, allowing the Muscats 
5 degrees more. When the bunches can be 
detected, thin the shoots to the number re- 
quired ; when tying them in, avoid twisting 
or over-stretching the shoots, rather bring 
them gradually to their required position. 
Have the latest house cleaned, and put in a 
working order by the end of the month. 

FLOWER GARDEN AIO> SHRUBBERY. 

Sow about the middle of the month the 
principal selection of hardy annuals ; and at 
the end of the month such as hollyhocks, 
scabiosa, campanula, carnation, polyanthus, 
Sweet William, aquilegia, &c. 

Plant and Transplant every bulb that may 
yet remain, as ranunculus, anemone, &c. the re- 
maining perennials, biennials, and autumn 
sown annuals, in the places where they are 
designed to flower : also finish planting ever- 
green and deciduous shrubs. 

General Directions. — Complete all kinds of 
winter pruning ; the laying of turf ; and the 
general making and planting of edgings ; if 
very dry weather prevails, thorough waterings 
must be resorted to in the latter case. Propa- 
gate, pot, and harden off bedding out plants. 
Roll and sweep the lawns ; also the walks, 
and turn or fresh gravel them if necessary; 
the hoe must be kept active in every place, to 
keep down weeds and loosen the surface ; rake 
only where a particular dressing is requisite.

Alpines may now be shifted, if not done in 
autumn. A soil of equal parts peat and loam, 
with a little sand, will suit them generally. In 
the case of these it is not so much large speci- 
mens that are required, as an interesting col- 
lection '. they must therefore be divided, and 
put again into the same pots ; five-inch pots 
is a convenient average size ; the spare plants 
thus obtained, should be immediately planted 
on the rockery, or in some similar situation. 

American Plants, (as Rhododendrons, Aza- 
leas, &c.) are benefited by a thorough dressing 
of well decomposed dung, of a cooling nature, 
such as cow-dung. They may yet be removed 
with care. It is usual to plant them in peat 
soil, but many will do in loam. They prefer 
a sheltered situation, and one moderately moist. 

Anemones. — Plant now, if not done ; stir 
up slightly the soil of the early beds, and pro- 
tect them when very cold or wet. 

Annuals. — Those of the tender kinds, sown 
early, should be potted off, and the forwardest 
shifted. Prick out the more hardy kinds in 
boxes or beds, and when rooted, give them 
air freely, so as to harden them ready for 
planting out soon : sow again in heat. The 
hardy kinds should be sown where they are to 
flower ; those in borders may be sown quite 
close to such plants as bulbs, which will soon 
be over. Prepare to have many of the 
hardened plants transferred at the end of the 
month, from the frames to a warm spot ; 
meanwhile admit plenty of air to them when 
mild and genial. 

Antirrhinums (Snapdragon.) — Plant out 
early either in beds, or singly ; it does in any 
ordinary soil, and is valuable from its continu- 
ing long in bloom : propagate the good 
varieties ; they will strike freely under glasses 
with or without heat. Seeds sown now will 
produce plants to flower in autumn. 

Aquilegia (Columbine.) — Plant out early, 
and sow a few at the end of the month, in any 
common soil, with other biennials and per- 
ennials for transplanting. 
. Auriculas. — The show sorts must be di- 
vested of the side shoots, which may be struck 
for stock. Keep them still in frames ; cover 
at nights ; water in the mornings, and air 
freely when mild ; slightly shade when the 
sun is fierce. 

Calceolarias. — The shrubby and the best 
of the herbaceous sorts should be increased by 
cuttings, struck in heat ; pot off those in store 
pots ; also shift those which are required for 
central or conspicuous places ; keep all under 
glass, but with plenty of air. 

Campanulas (Canterbury Bells,&c.) — Plant 
out if not finished ; sow a few at the end of 
the month. All the Campanulas are fine, as 
single plants ; and the C. carpatica is excellent 
for bedding. 



Carnations. — Sow a few of the border 
varieties at the end of the month in a 
frame. Plant out the cloves and common sorts, 
in a soil of equal parts loam and cow-dung, 
with some sand ; if in beds, put them one 
foot apart in the row, and two between. The 
single ones may be planted out in masses. 
Have the compost in preparation for shifting 
the choice varieties. 

Clematis and other deciduous climbers, which 
have been protected, must be uncovered 
gradually ; they must be kept covered at 
night. Prune them, and tie or nail in a few 
of the best ripened branches. 

Chrysanthemums. — Plant out, and increase 
by division of the roots ; they luxuriate in a 
rich soil of loam and cow-dung. Plant a few 
against walls, terraces, or railings. 

Crocus. — Now is a good season to mark the 
best varieties ; keep the soil about them fresh 
and clean. Trap the mice if they attack the 
roots, which they often do. 

Dahlias. — Where the seeds were sown last 
month, the seedlings should be pricked out 
and kept in a very slight heated frame. Pro- 
pagate the striped sorts freely for the flower 
garden ; also those required for general stock. 
Repot those which were struck early; and give 
them all plenty of air. 

Evergreens, as Laurels, Arbutus, &c, may 
still be slightly pruned, so as to balance the 
head ; but in pruning avoid too highly finished 
symmetry. , 

Fuchsias. — Partially uncover those in shel- 
tered situations ; cut the shoots back to fresh 
buds ; and train them mostly to one leading 
stem. If they are much injured, cut them 
down to the ground, and they will throw out 
young shoots from the roots, and thus form 
compact and handsome bushes. 

Jasmines and Honeysuckles. — Propagate still 
from cuttings ; uncover gradually where pro- 
tection was judged necessary, and have them 
all pruned, and nailed or tied up early. 

Mignonette often comes well self-sown, but 
it is better to sow a little : in new situations, 
where sowing is necessary, it may be done 
now ; cover the seeds slightly with soil. 

Mimulus. — Increase by division; plant either 
in beds or patches. The numerous varieties' 
of M.cardinalis andili". roseus are well adapted 
for large beds. 

Pansies. — Plant the fine sorts at the end of 
the month, about a foot apart ; leaf mould, 
cow-dung, and loam, equal parts, is an excellent 
soil. Propagate the scarce and good varieties 
in a gentle heat. 

Picotees. — Plant out the more common sorts 
in a soil similar to that recommended for car- 
nations. Prepare to pot the choicer kinds. 

Pinus. — Still protect those which are put- 
ting forth young shoots. In planting speci-

mens, drain the ground well ; trench, and plant 
on the surface, using fresh loam to place about 
roots. 

Plnhs. — Put out those which have been 
kept in hand glasses ; plant them a foot apart, 
in sandy loam, leaf mould, and rotten cow- 
dung ; fill up all vacancies, and plant the old 
stools in the borders. 

Polyanthus. — As the seeds germinate ex- 
pose them gradually to the light, by removing 
the moss, by which the surface was covered. 
The established plants must be planted out. 

Primroses. — In favourite spots place a little 
moss about the plants, to prevent the rains 
from dashing the mud on the flowers ; plant 
young plants, and sow seed. 

Ranunculus. — Should severe weather pre- 
vail, allow the covering to remain, not other- 
wise : lose no time in planting any of the 
roots that are left for succession al beds. 

Rockets. — Plant out those preserved in 
frames ; any common soil will suit. 

Roses. — Remove part of the coverings early. 
A few may be cut in close, to produce late 
flowers, and so form a succession ; cuttings 
should be made of the prunings of the China, 
Boursaults, &c, and inserted under a hand- 
glass amongst sand ; the Provins must be 
layered : grafting may now be effected, and 
the nearer the ground the better. 

Stocks. — Pot and prick out the early sow- 
ings ; remove them to a cold frame when they 
are got established, and harden them off by 
airing freely. Plant out those kept in pots 
during winter, say at eighteen inches apart ; 
and the richer the soil the better. 

Sweet William. — Finish planting out; let 
them be put in masses. Sow a little seed at 
the end of the month. 

Sweet Peas. — Harden off those sown last 
month, and sow now in the open ground, both 
in patches and single rows. 

Thrift Edgings may now be re-laid on a 
similar plan with those of the dwarf box. 

Tigridias. — Those early started must be 
removed into a cold frame to harden them off: 
plant additional roots for succession. 

Tulips. — Protect at night ; also in cold wet 
days ; dress them at the end of the month. 
Let them have any gentle and mild showers 
that may occur. 

Violets must be kept clean ; in some cases 
a little moss may be found necessary to keep 
the flowers from being dirtied. Provision 
should be made at the end of the month for 
the following season, by planting out the young 
rooted runners in frames, upon a rich soil ; 
keep them close and shade them for a day or 
two ; then air freely, and afterwards remove 
the sashes altogether. Another plan is now 
to scatter some fresh soil over the beds, in 
which the young runners will root, and early 



in autumn take them off and plant them in 
prepared beds or frames. 

AVINDOW GARDENING. 

The chief points to attend to, are to counter- 
act the effects of drought, and draughts of air, 
and to prevent the plants becoming drawn 
from the increasing heat. To meet these 
difficulties place the pots in which the plants 
are growing within another of larger dimen- 
sions, filling around and covering it with moss 
or sand, and thus preventing evaporation, and 
securing an equable temperature. Avoid plac- 
ing the windows or doors open at both sides of 
the room at once, or admit the air at the top 
only. Be regulated a good deal by the direction 
of the wind. To prevent the plants getting 
drawn in mild weather, put them out of doors 
in the forenoon, and always keep them as near 
the glass as may be practicable. 

Bulbs, such as Hyacinths, Crocus, &c, will 
be in full flower at the end of the month ; they 
should then slightly be shaded from the mid- 
day sun, and not suffered to get dry. 

Begonias will require additional watering as 
they advance in growth, but do not saturate 
the soil ; stake them up to avoid accidents. 

Camellias. — Those past flower should be 
shifted, and kept as warm as possible ; the 
object is to excite them to grow vigorously, so 
as to form their flower-buds and wood for next 
season. Give a little more water, but with the 
same care as before. 

Cinerarias. — Tie out the leading shoots, so 
as to admit the air about them, and give room 
for growth ; they require a good deal of water 
just before and when in flower. 

Fuchsias. — The early plants should be 
thinned, -and if bare of shoots stop the whole, 
excepting the leader ; those with one leading 
stem are the most handsome. Water freely, 
if they are growing luxuriantly ; excite the 
whole of the plants into growth ; when they 
are budding out, shift them into a fresh soil of 
leaf mould, sandy loam, and rotten dung. 

Geraniums may have a little liquid manure 
when showing their flower-buds : those re- 
quired for late flowering should be shifted; thin 
out all the weak shoots, and propagate good 
sorts. 

Myrtles and other evergreens may now be 
shifted, if not already done ; keep them shaded 
and close for a day or two after ; water and 
syringe freely. 

Roses, if in flower, should be shaded 
slightly ; destroy any vermin, such as the aphis, 
that may attack them before they do serious 
injury ; syringe them with tobacco liquor 
occasionally. Try, however, to prevent them 
getting established. 

Primulas, which are, perhaps, the best 
winter and spring flowers for the window, must 



GARDENING CALENDER FOR MARCH. 



113 



be watered moderately: save seeds of good 
varieties. The double ones must be carefully 
grown, but allow them to rest a while after 
flowering. 

Violets. — Keep near the light ; the young 
runners should be encouraged to root by 
shaking rich soil amongst them when past 
bloom ; grow these to flower next season. 
The old plants will also do again if the soil is 
renewed. Plant them all in the open air to 
grow until September. 

Wardian Cases. — If the interior has been 
kept dry, give a thorough watering, first having 
taken away all dead leaves and plants, and the 
exhausted soil, replacing the latter by fresh 
earth of a suitable kind. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

The principal operations will consist in 
sowing, propagating, potting, tying up, hard- 
ening off, airing, watering, and covering up 
properly at night to exclude frost. 

Annuals. — Those tender kinds that were 
sown early must be shifted again, and others 
potted off. The amaranths, thunbergias, &c, 
must be plunged in a warm frame and kept 
near the light. The main sowings of cocks- 
combs, balsams, browallias, and such like, 
should be made at the end of the month. Half 
hardy kinds, as schizanthus, brachycome, 
rhodanthe, &c, should also be sown again. 
The hardy species, as eoilinsia,gilia, &c, should 
be hardened off, and put out at the end of 
the month. 

Half hardy plants, as calceolarias, petunias, 
verbenas, &c, must be potted off singly, or two 
in a pot, and kept close for a few days, and 
then moderately so until established, and after- 
wards gradually hardened. Get a proper notion 
of what will be required for bedding out, so 
that now they may be propagated as fast as 
possible ; andto get these young plants forward, 
use the soil and water a little warmed ; ac- 
custom all these, particularly the young stock, 
to a free circulation of air, to prepare them 
for full exposure. Should it happen that frosts 
come unexpectedly and get at the plants, a 
remedy will be found in at once syringing them 
repeatedly with very cold water, and removing 
them to a cold frame, where they must be kept 
dark until thoroughly dry. 

Forcing Pit. — The utmost care is requisite 
to keep the roses and other flowers perfectly 
clean : repeated fumigations of tobacco, a moist 
atmosphere, and a steady heat of 60 degrees 
at night, and 70 degrees by day, will go 
far to secure this. The bulbs, and indeed every 
thing that is growing rapidly, will be assisted 
by watering them, say twice a week, with clear 
liquid manure: it is of importance that it is 
given, especially at first, in a weak state ; the 
state of the plant must determine the strength 
48. 



and quantity. G-ive some air every day, and 
shut up early ; still apply the chief waterings 
in the morning. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature, from 45 degrees to 55 de- 
grees by day ; and from 35 to 45 degrees by 
night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely at the top 
and bottom sashes, also by the doors in mild 
weather: no fire heat is ordinarily necessary. 

Watering. — Still (in the early part of the 
month) avoid spilling water as much as pos- 
sible. Towards the end, a thorough sj'ringing 
will be of benefit, if done in the morning, so 
as to be dried up by mid-day. Increase the 
water at the roots, but apply it so that the soil 
may be thoroughly moistened. Newly-potted 
plants must be watered sparingly. 

Potting. — Select those plants first for pot- 
ting which require it most : where the roots 
are matted, loosen and partially untwine them, 
and make the new soil and the ball unite. It 
is not always necessary to remove thoroughly 
the drainage crocks of the former potting. After 
potting keep them a little close for a few days, 
always removing them to their place of growing 
again, before watering. 

Soils. — Have a stock of turfy loam, peat, 
leaf-mould, river and silver sand, with charcoal 
and crocks all under cover, and ready for use. 
It is not important to have had them previously 
mixed, but it is well if they have been exposed 
to the frost : they should be moderately dry. 
Use new or clean washed pots. 

Dressing. — Continue to keep all tidy ; give 
a general look over the plants, for the purpose 
of cleaning them, re-staking, renewing tallies, 
and surface, and tying up the various plants 
requiring it. 

Insects. — Never tire in taking means to 
destroy these : sponge the plants that the 
syringe cannot clean : fumigate often, or in- 
stead, use diluted tobacco water. 

Aloes and succulents generally will be better 
shifted now than later ; use turfy loam, leaf- 
mould, and sand; drain well, and give little or 
no water. 

Agaves and large succulents may have a 
little water, if growing ; shift those not yet 
potted, or put in tubs, using a good turfy loam, 
and adding a little charcoal. 

Alstromerias. — If the potshave been covered 
with some plunging material, remove it early, 
before the plants are far advanced, and give 
the utmost attention to prevent injury from 
slugs ; air must be plentifully given them. 

Annuals. — Sow again at the end of the 
month. Give those growing freely a large 
shift before the roots become matted ; keep all 
near the light, in a moderate heat, and give 
air every day. 



114 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MARCH. 



Azaleas. — Many will now be in bloom ; 
these require more water ; shade slightly if the 
sun is violent ; keep those for late blooming in 
a cool and airy situation. 

Calceolarias. — A few will again require a 
shift, and these must be watered sparingly; 
stake and tie them up neatly. Make a large 
specimen or two of the shrubby sorts, as 
C.rugosa, angustifolia, &c. Seed may be sown 
now, if not done in autumn. 

Camellias. — Pot those whose bloom is past, 
if not done ; peat and light loam in equal parts 
is the best soil. They will make wood and 
flower buds in a heat of 60 degrees, not 
less ; attend to this with the early plants. 
Those in bloom must be kept cool ; and the 
late sorts must be brought gently along; to 
push them at this stage is fatal to the flower 
buds. 

• Cape Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c, must 
have no artificial heat further than the green- 
house or cold frame affords ; air freely, and 
increase the amount of water. 

Cephalolus follicularis (New Holland 
pitcher-plant). — Maintain a considerable de- 
gree of moistness all about it ; also closeness 
of the atmosphere by means of a glass. 

Cinerarias. — Give these all the light pos- 
sible, copious waterings, and air profusely : 
stake them as they require it. To make a very 
large specimen quickly for a conspicuous place, 
pot two plants together. 

Chrysanthemums. — Commence to take off 
a few of the young shoots from the early sorts 
first ; put them in four or six inch pots, in a 
soil of loam, leaf-mould, and sand, and keep 
them rather close for a week or so ; cuttings 
strike in heat. Plant out a few old stools in 
a warm place and rich soil, from which to take 
layers, &c. (for dwarf plants) in July. 

Crassulas and allied plants, as sempervi- 
vium, must be kept at the warm end always, 
and yet very sparingly watered. 

Cyclamens. — Keep these a little warm, 
and when past a flowering state dry them off 
gradually, but not too much. 

Epacris. — When cut back and beginning to 
grow, give a slight shift, water and keep them 
close for a few days : those in and coming into 
flower should be placed in an airy and cool 
position. 

Ericas. — Give increased quantities of air 
and water ; the former night and day, excepting 
when very cold winds prevail ; the latter should 
be applied liberally, to avoid the necessity for 
frequent repetition. Those plants that are 
producing long bare young shoots should be 
stopped, and those past bloom must be cleaned, 
and if unhandsome, may be partially cut back ; 
defer shifting them until they begin to grow. 
Any which appear to be confined in their pots 
should be shifted into the next size larger, 



using a soil of sandy peat, and mixing it with 
drainage, as charcoal, sandstone, &c. ; place 
them together, slightly shade if the weather is 
bright, and keep them close for a few days. 

Fuchsias. — Continue to shift these progres- 
sively as the roots touch the sides of the pots ; 
those in an advanced state will bear a good 
degree of heat with a corresponding increase 
of moisture. Train the plants to suit their 
respective situations : those with one stem will 
be the most useful ; stop the shoots all over, 
if the branches are thin and irregular. Shake 
the soil from the late sorts which are just 
starting to grow, and pot afresh. 

Gompholobiums, and slender creepers, should 
be placed in a light and airy situation ; thin, 
regulate, and tie regularly according as they 
grow ; give them a little freedom of growth : 
be particular in watering. 

Ilaworthias, Apicras, fyc. — Give a small 
shift : keep them at the warm part of the house, 
and give but little water. 

Helichrysums. — Water sparingly, and keep 
them free of the other plants ; they like light 
and air. 

Leschenaultias. — Shift carefully, if confined, 
into sandy peat with a little loam and charcoal 
mixed : do not stop them until they take with 
the pots : keep them in the light, and rather 
warm. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan lily). — Maintain 
a healthful, moderate, and steady temperature 
for these : stir, and add a little fresh soil as 
they grow. 

Mignonette. — Stake, and keep these near the 
glass, and where there is a free circulation of air. 

New Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiaeas, &c. — The acacias will soon be 
charming objects, and will require a good deal 
of water ; when past flower, and after resting 
a little while, give them a large shift: most of 
the other genera are more delicate, and the 
common error of overshifting and overwatering 
must be avoided. 

Orange-trees. — Keep these somewhat warm 
and moist as they are making fresh shoots and 
roots, but also give air, without which they are 
apt to become spindly. Strong shoots in open 
parts of the head may be stopped ; and stop them 
all over, if required, as they will grow more 
regular. They are found to do in a light as 
well as a strong loam ; the plants generally 
make most rootsh\ the former, and liquid ma- 
nure then takes the place of solid manure. 

Oxalis. — Admit air freely to these when 
mild ; give additional water to those advancing 
in growth ; keep them moderately moist. 

Pelargoniums. — Shift those struck in 
autumn, which should be again stopped two 
weeks previous to shifting, or be deferred until 
they have taken with the new pots : do not 
stop the old plants now, unless they are very

thin of shoots. Train a few plants to one or 
two shoots, the trusses from which will be 
double the size of the other bushy plants. Go 
over the prize plants again, and see that no 
useless spray is left. Propagate freely ; the 
cuttings rooted now may be flowered well in 
October, or early the following March. 

Primulas. — The superior formed, striking 
coloured, and semi-double sorts should be put in 
a place away from the others, so as, if pos- 
sible (keep them a little dry), to save seed from 
them. Pick off all the seed pods of those not 
required, which improves their flowering amaz- 
ingly. Pick off decayed leaves, stirring the 
soil, and giving additional water cautiously. 

Protects, Banksias, Dryandras, fyc. must 
not be shaded by other plants ; they must be 
carefully potted, well drained, and some char- 
coal lumps mixed through the sandy loam and 
peat ; water statedly and well, but not often. 

Rhododendrons. — Waterings of liquid ma- 
nure are beneficial, just before they come into 
bloom; keep them moist when growing, and in 
a dryish cool atmosphere when in bloom ; put 
them in a cool place to rest awhile when past 
flower. Those kept in pots must be shifted, 
and grown steadily : a number may be again 
planted out, when the danger of frost is past. 

Roses. — The principal number of the plants 
must be brought on slowly and naturally ; a 
few may be gently stimulated by liquid ma- 
nure and warmth. Those that were forced 
early must be put in a shady yet light situa- 
tion. Fumigate when symptoms of aphides 
appear. A moist air is always requisite to 
promote growth healthily. 

Salvias. — Now is an excellent time to pro- 
pagate these,- increasing only the showy sorts ; 
they must have a little heat and a mixture of 
sand and leaf mould. The specimen plants 
must be kept cool and topped. S. splendens 
is perhaps the best for pot culture, and must 
be grown in heat, in a richly manured soil. 

Stajtelias. — Put these in the warmest part of 
the house, and near the glass : they strike root 
readily when just laid on the surface. When 
shifted at the end of the month, shake away, 
or rather remove a great part of the old soil ; 
drain thoroughly, and use a soil of lime rub- 
bish, light loam, and silver sand, in equal parts; 
use rather small pots, and give very little 
water at any time. 

Tropfeolums. — Look to these almost every 
day, and direct, and tie out the young shoots, 
so as to have an equal amount of flower all 
over ; they must not be crowded amongst 
other plants ; grow them steadily. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature from 55 to 65 degrees by day, 
and about 45 degrees at night. Shade during 
strong sunshine ; use very little fire. 



Ventilation. — Still beware of causing cold 
currents, but both front and top sashes must 
be opened; canvass placed before the front 
openings, will soften the air as it enters. 

Watering. — The quantity applied must be 
increased, and it should still be given early in 
the morning. Towards the end of the month, 
it may be necessary to look over again, early 
in the afternoon. Give those planted out a 
thorough soaking, unless it was done late last 
month. 

Arrangement. — The New Holland plants 
will soon be in full bloom if not so already. 
Group them, even if the plants are few and the 
house small. Form a grove of acacia, or oranges, 
and let them remain so for a week; place them 
about a seat, thus forming an arbour. The 
camellias may also be so arranged; they have 
(though rich) a sombre appearance when to- 
gether. Put hyacinths, primulas, and such 
like in masses, or as edgings. Fine specimens 
of rhododendron, azalea, acacia, amaryllis, &c. 
should be made conspicuous. Cinerarias, cal- 
ceolarias, geraniums, &c. are also beautiful, 
when grouped by themselves. These are mere 
hints, which, in practice, will suggest others. 
Such a mode of arrangement is calculated to 
call up more pleasing emotions, than the stage- 
ing and stiff-like appearances of the usual style. 
Frequently change the position of the plants, in 
pots or tubs, so as to give freshness to the scene. 

General Directions. — The strictest tidiness 
and cleanliness must be maintained, the neces- 
sary operations in securing which, together 
with all other work, such as staking, tying, 
sponging over the leaves, attending to the 
climbers, returning plants to their respective 
departments, syringing for aphides, &c, should 
be effected as early in the day as possible, so that 
the house may throughout the greater part of 
the day be available for the use of the family, to 
the female portion of which it offers a delightful 
promenade, especially at this season. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature, from 70 to 80 degrees by 
day, and 60 to 70 degrees at night. 

Ventilation. — Admit air every da}', regu- 
lating the quantity according to the tempera- 
ture externally : pay strict attention to shut- 
ing up early, to lessen the demand for firing. 

Watering is at all seasons an important 
operation. As the demand is increased with 
the advancing season, so increase the supply, 
proportioning it to the state and habits of 
the various plants. Give preference always 
to rain water ; river water next ; and make 
it of the same warmth as the atmosphere of 
the house. Syringe in a shower -form every 
morning, and make the fires dry it up before 
night if the sun does not appear to do so. 
Keep the floors damp always.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOE MARCH. 



Potting. — Take those first which indicate 
being cramped in the pot, and which have 
commenced to grow. 

Insects. — Wash every dirty leaf ; whether 
the dirt arises from accumulations of dust or 
from insects, the effects are synonymous. 

Achimenes. — A cold frame grows these well 
in summer, but they conform to heat admi- 
rably : perhaps a pit is the best place for 
them, where there is a gentle bottom heat, and 
they can be kept near the light. They grow 
well in flat pans, and in baskets suspended, 
but the appearance is better in a pot, in which 
they attain a more symmetrical form when 
well grown. Apportion the started tubers (or 
those potted off in small pots last month) to the 
size of the flowering pots. The leaves of the 
plants must be perfectly dry before the sun 
strikes upon them. Put the late store pots 
into gentle heat, and apply very little water. 

AUamanda, Beaumontia, Echites, and all 
strong growing climbers, must be staked, trel- 
lised, or tied up the pillars, as it may happen; 
a slight thinning of the branches from time to 
time will be necessary. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, should all now be brought into active 
gi'owth ; bottom heat is beneficial, also liquid 
manure, when luxuriant. 

Aphelandras, Justicias, Ruellias, S?c. — The 
young plants must be encouraged by shifting 
and maintaining a moist steady heat ; shorten 
all the shoots ; and increase the best sorts by 
cuttings. 

Amaryllids. — Keep these in a moist heat ; 
the free growers must be supplied liberally 
with water. Those brought from the conser- 
vatory after growing, must gradually dry off. 

Begonias. — Those potted early should be 
shifted, and two or three tubers put into a pot. 
Continue a little bottom heat, and keep up a 
moist atmosphere. The whole should now be 
gradually excited into growth. 

Burchellia. — Those in flower keep cool ; 
those growing luxuriantly keep moist ; bring 
in the young stock, and grow them on freely. 

Cacti, keep only moderately moistened, 
and advance or retard their flowering by 
altering their position, or removing them to 
another house. Avoid, however, checking 
them by sudden and extreme changes. The 
young plants should be kept warm and moist. 
In such an atmosphere grafting may be suc- 
cessfully effected. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — Apply 
very little water until fresh roots are made in 
the new soil after potting. 

Clerodendrons. — Forward these by increas- 
ing the heat, light, space, and moisture ; they 
are noble objects, and may be grown to any 
size. Sow seeds now. 

Climbers. — Thin, and tie up these ; apply 



a trellis, or stakes at once to those plants 
which are in a position to receive them. 

Daturas. — Again shift those which are 
evincing signs of being confined at the root ; 
give a rich soil, heat, moisture, light, and 
space, and they will be fine. 

Erythrinas. — Treat them similarly to the 
Daturas. 

Euphorbias. — Increase the heat. The E. 
jacquiniflora may be excited, cuttings struck, 
and young plants again stopped; also the 
old naked plants may be tied down in a pendu- 
lous form, and this will make them break 
anew. 

Ferns. — Look over these frequently ; the 
tallies, from the damp atmosphere they are 
kept in, get soon illegible, in which case re- 
new them, doing the worst first ; keep in the 
house a moist, moderate, and even tempera- 
ture. Do not think of watering the seeds 
when they are sown, but set the pots in a 
feeder of water. 

Gardenias. — A moist, sweet, and rather 
strong dung heat is suitable for the growing 
and the flowering of these. When in flower 
remove them to the conservatory, placing 
them in the warmest part ; propagate largely 
if the stock is scanty. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, fyc. — The principal 
part of these should be shooting vigorously ; 
give a shift to those started early, which water 
sparingly; also those lately set to work. If 
bottom heat can be had, and the plants at the 
same time kept near the glass, apply it so. 
Leaf-cuttings of these plants, and many allied 
ones, strike freely now. 

Bippeastrum, Crinums, Pancratium s, $?c. 
— Plunge in the tan-pit, after being shifted, 
and when growing vigorously supply them 
abundantly with atmospheric moisture, and 
manure water at the roots. 

Hydrangeas are mentioned here, because 
they bear stove forcing. The tops of the 
shoots just showing flower may be struck in 
heat ; they make nice dwarf plants. The 
blue flowers have been produced from growing 
in rocky irony soil, and iron filings ; and pure 
loam, also, has had the same effect. Peat, 
too, and waterings of strong liquid manure, 
have produced the effects. Try some of the 
alkalies in solution, by way of experiment. 

Ipomceas. — Pot off a few of the seeds 
sown last month ; plunge them, and give a 
slight watering ; tie in and thin the perennial 
sorts which now grow fast. 

Ixoras. — Allow these to occupy the best 
part of the tan-pit, and near the glass; again 
tie out the branches. Encourage the young 
plants. 

Jasminums, llondeletias, Brunfehias, keep 
growing steadily, not hastily ; put in cuttings 
of the scarce and choice sorts. The jasmines, 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MARCH; 



117 



which are just past blooming, allow to rest for 
a little. 

Lantanas. — Shift, before they grow much; 
use a soil of sandy peat alone ; pot off the 
cuttings, and by topping they can be formed 
to any shape. 

Luculia gratissima. — Syringe with tobacco 
water if green fly appear ; grow in a steady 
heat. The old plants may be slightly cut back 
if a large stock is required, not otherwise; 
slightly water when not growing freely. 

Lycopodiums are very accommodating, for 
any situation not extreme (in the stove) will 
suit many of them. Suit the watering ac- 
cordingly, and if the atmosphere is quiet, 
damp, yet pure, there is no danger. 

JIalvaceous Plants, as hibiscus, must be 
kept growing : pot off the seedlings, and let 
them have sufficient air to prevent a lanky 
growth, and secure a sturdy one. 

3Ianettias, and other tender climbers, must 
be preserved from insects; keep tying them 
in neatly, but not too often ; cuttings in pure 
sand will strike freely under a bell glass. 

Melastomas. — Supply largely with heat, 
moisture, light, and space; they are seldom well 
grown, for want of these. 

31 eh- Cacti may have increased moisture 
and heat as the season advances ; liquid manure 
is found to push them on satisfactorily if not 
applied in excess. 

JIusas. — Let them have liquid manure at 
the roots, and moisture and heat in abundance. 
The 31. chinensis, or Cavendiskii suits low 
houses best, and can now be shifted into their 
fruiting pots or tubs. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher Plant). — Maintain a 
rising heat and humid atmosphere ; these are 
not difficult to strike if care be taken, but they 
can be propagated by layering. 

Neriums. — Now the most of them can be 
taken into heat and moisture, increasing it 
gradually and lavishly. 

Nym/phceas (Water Lilies) may be shifted 
into a rich soil, and afterwards kept warm ; they 
will flower in a pot if covered with water. 

Palms. — If confined at the root should have 
a shift, if not done; keep them close, moist, and 
shaded after ; give the whole a high temper- 
ature, although many will live in a very tem- 
perate degree of heat. 

Pollanthes (Tuberose.) — Give plenty of 
light, and a moist heat, and increase the pro- 
portion, and water as they grow. 

Thunbergias — Syringe twice a day, and 
keep them from a dry heat. Eemove some of 
the early plants to their flowering pots, and 
put stakes or trellis to them ; give the young 
shoots a clear direction and they will take it, 
without being tied. Pot off the last sowing ; 
peat, loam, and leaf mould equally divided, 
grows them well. 



Vincas. — If possible, keep them from flow- 
ering when other flowers are plentiful. Bring 
them into luxuriance ; then top them, and 
perfect their shape ; cuttings may be struck 
at any time. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm house for the In- 
dian species, 80 degs. by day, 70 degs. at night ; 
the cool, or Mexican house, 75 degs. by day, 
and 60 to 65 degs. at night ; allow a few de- 
grees more or less, according to the weather. 

Ventilation. — Admit air cautiously yet 
pretty freely by the top, especially in the 
cool house ; give and take it off by degrees, 
and shut up soon enough to cause the thermo- 
meter to rise 5 degs. by the natural heat. 
After shutting up see that the fire heat will 
meet the decreasing temperature in due time. 

Watering. — Supply the growing plants in- 
creasingly with moisture, not so much at the 
roots as in the atmosphere ; syringe gently in 
bright weather, twice a day, and not at all if 
dull ; every part of the house should be kept 
damp. It will be found that the terrestrial 
species require more every way than the epi- 
phytes. Always use tepid water. 

Insects require constant efforts to destroy 
them, even when the plants are considered 
clear. It is a good plan to mark the places 
where the plants are damaged, and look over 
these at night, when the enemies may often be 
detected. 

Potting. — A number of the plants may re- 
quire shifting ; and the earlier in the month this 
is done the better. Let the pseudo -bulbs of the 
terrestrial species be covered an inch or so. 

Shading. — Towards the end of the month, 
and as the sun gets brighter and stronger, it 
will be necessary to apply shading to the roof 
of the house on the sunny side. Those plants 
which have been shifted, and are making ten- 
der shoots, most require this attention. 

Soils. — The cyrtopodiums, and allied kinds, 
do best with liberal treatment in every re- 
spect ; broken bones may be intermixed with 
the turfy loam. Sticks of charcoal, also, may 
be mixed with the turfy peat, which is a 
standard medium suitable to the roots of these 
plants. Many of the cattleyas, lrelias, pha- 
lasnopsis, &c, must have little else than a 
bare block of wood ; any kind of wood will 
suit, if not resinous. Experiment with some 
plants if practicable, for there is much to 
learn respecting them ; for instance, the 
Catasetunilongifolium does best when turned 
upside down. 

Imported Plants. — Keep rather cool than 
otherwise ; allow them generally to make their 
first growth on blocks. Syringe occasionally, 
but regulate this by the heat ; once a day is 
not too often in warm weather.

BOTANICAL TERMS. 



BOTANICAL TERMS, 
CHIEFLY APPLIED TO ROOTS OF PLANTS. 

The different kinds of roots are not numer- 
ous : some terms often applied as to roots, 
such as bulbous, tuberous, &c, really belong 
to stems of a peculiar nature. 

Bulbous (Jbulbosus ) ; a term often applied 
to what is called a root ; but what is called a 
bulbous-root is a peculiar kind of leaf-bud 
attached to a thickened stem : the fibres issu- 
ing from the under side of bulbs are the real 
roots. 

Fasciculated ; applied to tubercular roots, 
when they grow in clusters. 

Fibres, fibrils ; the small thread-like, or 
minute subdivisions of the roots ; they are 
little bundles of annular ducts — sometimes of 
spiral vessels — encased in woody fibre, and 
covered with a lax cellular integument. The 
apex, which has the property of absorbing 
fluid with great rapidity, consists of extremely 
lax cellular tissue, and is called the spongiole, 
or spongelet. 

Fibrous; applied to roots when divided 
into a number of slender thread-like filaments, 
or fibres. 

Fusijorm ; applied to roots which are fleshy, 
straight, and tapering more or less to each 
extremity, as in the radish : the term is equi- 
valent to tap-rooted. 

Globose ; this term is applied when the root 
becomes dilated immediately below the base 
of the stem, as in the turnip. 

Granulose ; having small fleshy particles 
intermixed with the fibres ; divided into little 
knobs, or knots, as in some kinds of saxifrage. 

Granular (gramdatus) ; same as granulose. 

Macrorhiza ; large or long rooted. 

Nodulose; applied to fibrous roots having 
occasional dilatations, similar to granulose ; 
this form occurs in some of the vicias. 

Prcemorse (jprcemorsus)', applied when the 
end of a fleshy root is abrupt, and looks as 
if bitten off short. The Scabiosa succisa, 
or devil's bit, is a familiar example of this kind 
of root. 

Radicle (radicula) ; this term is often ap- 
plied indiscriminately to fibrous roots, but the 
root of an embryo is more properly expressed 
by it, and it is convenient to confine it to this 
signification. 

Ramose ; branching, applied when the root 
is divided into a multitude of branches and 
fibres. 

Rhizina, rhizula; terms applied to the 
young roots of mosses and lichens. 

Spindle-shaped ; straight and fleshy, taper- 
ing to both extremities. 

Spongiolex, spongelets ; the absorbing apex 
of the fibres, by whose agency the plant is 



nourished by the food extracted from the 
soil in which it is placed. 

Tubercules ; fleshy roots composed of dis- 
tinct lobes, accompanying the fibrils of some 
plants, and apparently serving as reservoirs of 
nutriment : the roots of the orchis are of this 
kind. 

Tuberous; the term is often applied to 
what is called a root, but the tuber is a kind 
of stem. The so-called root of a potato is a 
tuber. 

Tap-rooted; having fusiform, or spindle- 
shaped roots. 

CHIEFLY APPLIED TO THE PARTS OF THE 

STEM. 

Adventitious; applied to buds which ap- 
pear accidentally, or out of place, that is, in a 
position where buds are not usually produced 
in the particular kind of plant. 

Acaulis ; stemless. Strictly speaking, all 
plants have a stem more or less developed, but 
in some, as in the common gentianella, it is 
very short, and such plants are said to be 
stemless. 

Adnascens, adnatum ; terms applied to the 
little bulbs developed in the axils of the scales 
of which the original bulb is formed, such as 
are called by gardeners, cloves. 

Adnascentia, adnata, appendices ; terms ap- 
plied to a slight modification of the sucker, 
such as the shoots thrown up from the under- 
ground part of the stem of pine-apples. 

Aiguillons ; stalked glands formed on the 
rose and other plants, in the form of rigid 
hairs ; by some improperly called setce. 

Ala ; an old term, synonymous with axil. 

Alburnum; the latest formed, and outer- 
most layer of wood ; the sap-wood situated im- 
mediately beneath the bark. 

Anabices ; a term applied by some to the 
stems of cryptogamic plants. 

Articulate {articulatus) ; jointed ; falling 
in pieces, or separating readily at certain 
points, which are called joints or articulations. 
Sometimes the term is used in reference to 
stems which appear only, and are not in reality 
thus jointed. 

Axil ; the point between two diverging 
branches, or between a leaf and a branch. 

Bacilli ; a term applied to the little stem 
bulbs borne by some plants. 

Bark ; the external ring, or covering, which 
envelopes the stem, lying immediately over 
the wood from which it is separable. 

Brachiate (brachiatus) ; when opposite 
branches diverge at right angles from the 
stem, crossing each other alternately, they are 
said to be brachiate ; four ranked, spreading 
in four directions. 

Branches ; the primary ramifications of the 



BOTANICAL TERMS. 



119 



stem, as distinguished from the smaller ramifi- 
cations, or twigs. 

Branchlets ; same as twigs ; the smaller 
ramifications of the branches. 

Branched (ramosus) ; divided into many- 
branches. 

Brindilles ; the twigs, or branchlets of the 
stem ; same as ramuli. 

Bulbo-tuber ; a term applied to the cormus; 
which is also sometimes called bulbo-solklus. 

Bulbilli ; little bulbs borne on the stems of 
some plants, as in some kinds of lilies. 

Bulbs; distinguished by Linnaeus as leaf- 
buds of the roots, which conveys a good idea 
of their nature ; they contain the embryo of a 
stem, surrounded by imbricated scales, the 
outer of which are membranous, and cohere 
into a covering, as in the onion, or consist of 
distinct and separate pieces, as in the lily. 

Calamus; a term applied to fistulous sim- 
ple stems without articulations, such as those 
of rushes. 

Cambium; amucous viscid secretion found be- 
tween the bark and the wood ; the elaborated sap. 
Caudex ; the trunk, or principal stem ; ap- 
plied chiefly to that of a tree. 

Cauliculi ; small stems produced from buds 
at the neck of a plant, without the previous 
production of a leaf. 

Caulis ; a term applied to the stem. 
Cellular integument ; the epidermis, or 
scarf-skin. 

Chalumeau ; a French term for calamus. 
Climbing stem ; a stem which elevates it- 
self by clinging to surrounding bodies, by 
means of roots or tendrils which it produces. 

Cloves; small bulbs developed from the 
axils of the scales of larger ones. 

Coarcture ; a term applied to the collet. 
Collet, collum; the line of division between 
the root and stem ; the neck. 

Coma ; the assemblage of branches forming 
the head of a forest tree. 

Corm {cormus); a solid fleshy depressed 
subterranean stem ; often considered to be a 
root, though this is an erroneous application ; 
the fleshy base of the crocus is a corm. 
Cortical ; of or belonging to the bark. 
Corticate (corticatus) ; harder externally 
than internally ; resembling bark. 

Corymbose {co7-ymbosus) ; arranged like a 
corymb, which term is more usually applied to 
the arrangement of the flowers. 

Creeping stem (sobole) ; a slender hori- 
zontal under-ground stem, emitting roots, and 
young plants at intervals ; the couch grass 
(or quitch-grass of some) is an example far too 
familiar of this kind of stem. 

Culm (culmus) ; the stem of grasses and 
allied plants ; the straw of wheat and other 
corn plants will furnish illustrations ; the 
culm is hollow, and jointed. 



Decorticate ; to divest of bark. 
Dichotomous (dichotomus) ; divided always 
in pairs ; that is to say, forked with two 
prongs : many stems branch in this way. 

Dumose (dumosus) ; low, and much 
branched, applied to shrubby plants of this 
particular habit. 

Duramen ; the heart Avood of trees ; it 
becomes harder and deeper coloured ; in some 
trees, as in the oak, it becomes of a deep 
brown, and in the ebony quite black. 

Endogenous ; growing by additions to the 
interior : endogenous stems have neither the 
pith, bark, medullary rays, nor wood distin- 
guishable, but all are irregularly arranged. 
Monocotyledonous plants produce endogenous 
stems : the stems of palms afford an illustra- 
tion. 

Epidermis ; the exterior coating of cellular 
substance ; the cuticle or cellular integument. 
Enodis; applied to stems which are alto- 
gether without joints. 

Excoriate; to divest of the bark or skin. 
Exogenous ; growing by additions to the 
exterior ; an exogenous stem consists of bark, 
wood, pith, and medullary rays, all more or 
less obvious and distinguishable. All our 
timber trees are of this mode of growth. 
Plants having this description of stem, are 
analogous to dicotyledons. 

Fiagellum ; a trailing shoot, such as that of 
the vine. 

Gemmae ; leaf buds of the stem. 
Geniculum ; a term applied to the joints 
or nodes of the stem. 

Hami; hairs curved back at the point, so 
as to form hooks. 

Haidm ; the stems of herbs. 
BZybernaculum ; the shell of a bud, formed 
of the young leaves in the form of scales, 
imbricated or overlying one another. It af- 
fords protection to the tender parts during 
the winter. 

Tnternode iinternodiuin) ; the space that 
intervenes between the point of insertion of 
the leaves, or between the joints or knots of 
the stem. The node is the point of the stem 
whence the leaves arise ; the internode is the 
space between them. 

Leaf buds ; the bodies which contain the 
rudiments of young branches in an incipient 
or embryo state ; they are situated on the 
stem ; growing points, covered with rudimen- 
tary leaves. 

Lecus ; a term applied to the corm. 
Lenticelles; lenticular or lens-shaped glands ; 
brown oval spots found on the bark of many 
plants, as in the willow. 

Liber ; the innermost layer of bark, or in- 
terior lining of woody tissue ; it is the finest 
and most delicate of all the layers of bark, and 
is often beautifully reticulated, as in Daphne

THE BEET, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE 
POTATO. 

The deficiencies arising from the extensive 
failure of the potato crop in 1845 and 1846, 
and the uncertainty which hangs over that 
of future years, in consequence of mystery 
as to its cause, make it desirable that other 
plants, capable of supplying food to man, 
should to a certain extent be cultivated instead 
of the potato ; at least by the poor, and those 
who at all depend on their garden produce. 
Many substitutes have been pointed out : 
among the rest, beet, carrots, parsnips, and 
turnips, among roots, have been suggested, 
while an increased amount of corn-crops of 
various kinds have been recommended. 

Nothing appears likely to answer the pur- 
pose so well as the Beet-root. Rich in the 
elements of nutrition, it is particularly adapted 
to enter largely into the composition of bread; 
the roots, when properly cooked, form an ex- 
cellent and nutritive vegetable; and the leaves 
may be used as spinach, — at all events they 
are excellent as fodder for cows, for sheep, 
and for pigs. The plant, too, is of easy 
cultivation ; the crop is almost a certain one ; 
and the seed is not costly at the outset. 

To the cottager, then, and to the small 
holder, this crop may be strongly recom- 
mended ; and such cultivators should also be 
recommended on the other hand, not to depend 
upon the potato, until at least the experience 
of a few more years has shown the " disease" to 
have passed away. 

Compared with potatoes, the nutritive pro- 
perties of beet-root would be represented by 
1020, potatoes being 433 ; and in regard to 
useful produce of all kinds, the beet would be 
represented by 8330, potatoes being repre- 
sented by 3480. In bulk, therefore, as well 
as in quality, the beet-root has greatly the ad- 
vantage. A few hints on the cultivation and 
preparation of this crop for food, will not 
therefore be inopportune. 

Varieties. — The common Beet (Beta vul- 
garis), has given rise to numerous varieties ; 
some of which are regarded as garden roots, 
while others are preferred for field-culture; of 
the latter class are those varieties known as 
the mangold wurtzel, or field beet. Where 
the crop is grown with any view to the feeding 
of stock, this field-beet is to be preferred, on 
account of the bulk of its produce ; which, 



under good management, is enormous ; but, 
viewed simply as a garden crop, the garden 
varieties of the beet are preferable, being less 
coarse in texture, smaller in size, and there- 
fore more convenient in a culinary point of 
view : probably there is little actual difference 
in the qualities of the garden and field beet, 
but in cases of this kind it is desirable to grow 
close solid roots of moderate size, in preference 
to larger ones ; which are often hollow, and 
always inconvenient. 

The following varieties are chiefly recom- 
mended : — for earliness, the turnip-rooted 
red Beet ; for bulk of crop, the large-rooted 
red Beet, and the large yellow Beet ; and 
for flavour, the dwarf red Beet, and the 
yellow Castlenaudari Beet. The first may 
be sown early, to meet present wants as soon 
as possible ; the next will be the most pro- 
fitable to grow for the purpose of mixing 
with flour to form bread ; the others, more 
particularly where the roots are intended for 
cooking as a vegetable. 

Culture. — A deep, rich, and somewhat 
sandy soil, is the most suited for the culti- 
vation of the Beet-root. This should be 
deeply trenched, and well drained, besides 
having the advantage of good culture in other 
respects, to bring it to a free open texture. 
Such ground should be trenehed, say two feet 
deep, in the early part of the winter. If the 
soil is not so deep as this, the subsoil is not to 
be brought up to cover the good soil ; but 
simply broken up to that depth in the bottom 
of the trench. The rougher the ridges are 
laid the better, so that the frost may penetrate. 
During frosty weather, and the piercing winds 
of March, these ridges may be once or twice 
turned over to expose a fresh surface of the 
soil to the atmosphere. Whatever manure 
is applied, should be in a well decomposed 
state, and should be applied at the time of 
trenching, being then well mixed throughout the 
whole bulk of the soil. Fresh rank dung should 
never be applied. In the trenching, and the 
subsequent operations of forking over the soil, 
this one great object should be kept steadily 
in view, viz. : — to reduce the soil to a 
uniform fine tilth, no large rough unbroken 
clods being allowed to remain, and the 
large stones — where they exist — being 
removed. 

By the latter end of March, or early in 
April, the first crop may be sown. Previous 
to this, the ground must be forked over again, 
the ridges being at this time levelled down, 
and all the large clods which remain being 
broken to pieces. Fine dry weather should be 
chosen for this operation, as it cannot be pro- 
secuted fairly under other circumstances. The 
exact time of sowing must be regulated in 
some degree by the season : if the weather is 



122 



THE BEET,, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE POTATO. 



inclement, and the spring naturally a backward 
one, the beginning of April will be soon 
enough ; but if otherwise, the fourth week in 
March may be selected for the purpose. The 
seeds are to be sown in drills, drawn about two 
inches deep ; the early variety being a small 
grower, one foot will be space enough between 
the rows ; the seeds should be dropped two or 
three together at regular distances in the drills, 
about ten inches apart, only one plant being 
ultimately allowed to remain. After sowing, 
the seed is to be carefully covered over about 
one inch deep with fine soil. If the season be 
a dry one, the seed may be soaked in milk- 
warm water before sowing it, to assist germi- 
nation ; but if a wet one, this will not be 
necessary. 

The main early sowing may be made after 
the middle of April, in the way above de- 
scribed; only for the larger sorts two feet must 
be allowed between the rows ; and for the 
other intermediate varieties eighteen inches. 
For the large sorts, from twelve to fifteen 
inches may also be allowed in the row. The 
main sowing for winter storing, may be made 
about the beginning of May, in a similar way. 

When the seeds have fairly germinated 
the surface of the ground should receive a 
deep hoeing, and at the same time, the plants 
should be thinned out, leaving one only — the 
strongest — of each patch. Blanks, if any 
should exist, may be filled up by carefully 
transplanting some of the supernumerary plants. 
The hoeing must be repeated during fine dry 
weather, at intervals of two or three weeks; 
and as the plants increase in size, the soil may 
be slightly drawn towards them. No other 
culture is required. 

When the plants have attained considerable 
size, with a full head of leaves, part of the 
latter may be taken off for feeding live stock : 
it is a portion of the lower ones that may thus 
be removed, about a third in quantity of those 
on the plants ; they are to be gathered off, 
nut cut. The whole piece may be gathered 
from in this way ; and subsequently, when an 
increase of growth has been made, the same 
process may be repeated once or twice. It 
must not be carried to excess. 

The early sowing will have attained matu- 
rity in August, and will even have been fit 
for use much earlier. The roots may be used 
when they have attained a diameter of two or 
three inches, and have acquired some degree 
of solidity. Whatever of the crop may re- 
main unused by the period of its maturity, 
may be taken up and stored for immediate 
use, the roots requiring to be lifted without 
being bruised, and the tops carefully twisted 
off above the crown. The roots may be 
slightly dried, and then stored away, among 
dry sand or earth, in a cool place. The other 



sowings, as they attain maturity, are to be 
similarly treated. The late crops are to be 
taken up about the end of October, in the 
same careful manner, and also stored among 
some dry material, in a cool place, free from 
frost ; or buried in heaps of soil, as other 
roots are kept. 

The beets are sportive plants ; it is there- 
fore desirable to obtain and secure varieties of 
genuine character. 

P reparation. — As a vegetable, the beet- 
root is cooked by boiling till it becomes per- 
fectly tender ; it is then nutritious and 
agreeable, having a somewhat sweet flavour, 
perhaps rather over sweet for some palates. 
Another mode is to bake them in the mould, 
as they are dug up or stored, or roast them in 
wood ashes ; and some prefer this mode. 
But the best mode is to clean them without 
bruising, then to enclose them in a crust of 
flour and water, and bake them : when they 
are done the crust is removed. The roots 
must not be bruised, as this admits the escape 
of the juices ; neither must they be laid in 
water, as this renders them insipid. When the 
leaves are used as spinach, they are to be 
gathered and boiled in the usual way. 

The most important domestic application of 
beet-root is that of entering into the compo- 
sition of bread. In this country the experi- 
ment of mixing rasped red beet-root with equal 
quantities of flour, has been found to produce 
good bread, very similar to brown bread in 
taste and appearance. The pale-coloured 
sugar-beet would yield a whiter bread, 
of even better quality. The following is the 
formula which has been employed : — To one 
stone of Beet-root, boiled till it becomes soft, 
and well mashed, is added one stone (equal 
parts) of wheaten flour : the dough is then 
baked with yeast in the ordinary way. The 
addition of half an ounce of bread soda, to one 
stone (141bs.) of the dough, answers the pur- 
pose of yeast in making the bread light, whole- 
some, and nutritious. The same mixture is 
suitable for making griddle bread. 

M. Payen, however, a distinguished chemist, 
regards 33 per cent, of beet-root as the most 
convenient proportion in the composition of 
bread; and his researches show that this mix- 
ture is scarcely inferior to pure wheaten bread, 
in the amount of nitrogen it contains; nitrogen 
being the chief nourishing principle of bread. 
He states, that " in 100 parts of bread formed 
of 67 wheaten flour and 33 beet-root, and 100 
parts formed of pure flour, the difference in 
this respect is considerably less than 1 per 
cent. (0,65)." This slight deficiency in nutri- 
tive qualities it is proposed to make good by 
the addition of a small quantity — not enough 
to affect the palatableness of the bread — of 
beans or peas, both of which are rich in nitro-

gen ; and according to this view, the following 
is the proportion recommended : — 

lbs - __ lbs. of bread. 

200 Wheat flour, contain of nitrogen as much as 266 

100 Beet-root, ,, „ 21 

21 Beans, or Peas, ,, „ 28 

315 

This calculation shows that the proportion 



thus recommended, represents, in the amount 
of nutritive properties, 3151bs. of bread, which 
is an important gain resulting from the ad- 
mixture of beet-root and pulse. 

The roots of the beet are also stated to be 
dried and ground, and sometimes used as " a 
supplement to coffee."

WILD SPRING FLOWERS. 



THE WINTER ACONITE. 

The Winter Aconite belongs to the genus 
Eranthis, of which the following is the botani- 
cal character '.— Calyx of five to eight petaloid 
deciduous sepals. Petals small, tubular, with 
a long claw, two-lipped, inner lip very short. 
Capsules numerous, many seeded, stalked. — 
The Winter Aconite {E. Memalis) the only 
species, is a naturalized plant. 

E. hiemalis, Salisbury (winter-flowering 
Eranthis, or Winter Aconite), — Root (rhizoma) 
tuberous ; stem with two opposite sessile 
leaves just below the solitary flower ; root 
leaves on long stalks, five to seven parted, 
deeply cut into linear-oblong segments; sepals 
six to eight, oblong. A small herbaceous per- 
ennial, hailed by every one as one of the ear- 
liest harbingers of spring, and well known by 
its cup-shaped solitary yellow flower, seated, 
as it were, upon a .circlet of narrow leaves, 
but which in fact consists of a pair only of 
sessile leaves, each parted into narrow seg- 
ments. The flowers are yellow ; they grow 
from four to six inches high, seldom more. 
Flowers in February and March. Found 
naturalized in thickets in the south and other 
parts of England ; by no means a true native. 
It is of very simple culture, requiring only 
that the roots should not be too often disturbed. 



Miller says, " the roots may be taken up and 
transplanted any time after their leaves decay, 
which is generally by the beginning of June, 
till October ; when they will begin to put out 
new fibres ; but, as the roots are small and 
nearly of the colour of the ground, so if care 
is not taken to search them out, many will be 
left in the ground. These roots should be 
planted in small clusters, otherwise they will 
not make a good appearance, for single 
flowers scattered about the borders, of these 
small kinds, are scarce seen at a distance ; but 
when these and the snowdrops are alternately 
planted in bunches, they will have a good 
effect, as they flower at the same time." 

THE WILD ANEMONE. 

The botanical character of the genus Ane- 
mone is as follows : — Involucrum of three 
cut leaves distant from the flower. Calyx 
petaloid, of many segments. Corolla wanting. 
Carpels inserted upon a thickened hemisphe- 
rical or conical receptacle, not bursting, tipped 
with persistent, sometimes feathery styles. 
Four species are found in this country. 

Anemone Pulsatilla, Linnasus (Pasque 
flower). — Leaves doubly pinnate, leaflets 
pinnatifid, with linear lobes ; flowers solitary, 
erect, of six sepals ; involucrum sessile, cut in 



124 



WILD SPRING FLOWERS. 



deep linear segments ; carpels nith feathery 
tails. A herbaceous perennial, with, the leaves 
all radical, hairy, doubly pinnated, and cut into 
narrow linear acute segments. The flowers 
each terminate a stalk about six inches high ; 
they are of a violet-purple colour, and silky 
externally ; the involucre is silky, and situ- 
ated close to the flower, but by the elongation 
of the stalk becomes distant from the fruit ; the 
sepals are linear oblong, united into a bell- 
shaped figure, spreading at the base, and re- 
curved towards the point. The carpels are 
numerous, crowded, tapering into a long fea- 
thery awn. Flowers in April and May. 
Found in dry chalky and loamy pastures in 
various parts of England. This species of 
Anemone is a very handsome early border 
flower. Like most others of the genus, the 
plant is poisonous to cattle if eaten in quantity; 
this poisonous property resides in the acrid 
salt, called anemonine, which irritates and in- 
flames the skin. Gerarde called it the Pasque- 
flower, from its flowering about Easter. 

Anemone nemorosa, Linnaeus (wood Ane- 
mone). — Leaves few, ternate with lanceolate 
leaflets; involucrum of three ternate (or qui- 
nate) leaves, similar to the root leaves ; flowers 
solitary, of six elliptic sepals; carpels awnless, 
pubescent, heeled. A small but very beautiful 
herbaceous perennial, w T ith a horizontal rhizoraa, 
or root-like stem, and very few ternate leaves, 
with oblong, lanceolate, two or three cleft 
leaflets. The involucre consists of three peti- i 
olated leaves similar to the root leaves. The 
flowers each terminate a slender stalk, about 
three inches high, and consist of six oblong, or : 
elliptic smooth sepals, white or pale pink. The 
carpels are numerous, obliquely ovate, com- 
pressed, and pointed with the persistent style. 
Flowers in April. Found rather plentifully in 
groves, thickets, woods, and shady banks. 
This is one of our earliest native flowers ; and 
though rather small, is extremely pretty, either 
in its native groves, or under cultivation. In a 
cultivated state it becomes double from the 
change of the stamens into petals, a metamor- 
phosis resulting from high cultivation, and 
often manifested in other plants. " The roots 
of this," says Miller, " may betaken up when 
their leaves decay, and transplanted in wilder- 
nesses, where they will thrive and increase 
greatly if they are not disturbed ; and in the 
spring, before the trees are covered with 
leaves, they will have a very good effect, in 
covering of the ground, and making a pleasing 
variety at that season." 

Anemone apennina, Linnaeus (blue moun- 
tain Anemone). — Leaves few, ternate ; invo- 
lucrum of three ternate leaves, similar to 
the root leaves ; flowers erect, solitary, of 
numerous lanceolate sepals ; carpels pointed, 
awnless. A herbaceous perennial, of habit 



similar to the last, but differing most obviously 
in its flowers, which consist of numerous — 
twelve to eighteen — linear oblong obtuse seg- 
ments, and are of a pretty light-blue colour. 
Flowers in April. Found in a few places in 
England, but regarded a very doubtful native. 
It is an exceedingly beautiful little plant, of 
rather larger size than A. nemorosa. 

A. ranunculoides, Linnceus (yellow wood 
Anemone). — Leaves few, ternate, or quinate ; 
involucrum ternate, cut; flowers solitary, or in 
pairs, of/z ve or six elliptic sepals; carpelspointed, 
awnless. A herbaceous perennial with very 
much the general appearance of A. nemorosa. 
The root is similar ; the leaves are ternate, 
often quinate, with oblong lanceolate leaflets ; 
the involucre similar in form to the leaves. The 
flowers are solitary on a slender stem, and con- 
sist of five or six bright yellow sepals, which 
are somewhat pubescent externally ; the car- 
pels are not numerous, obliquely ovate, com- 
pressed, and pointed by the persistent style. 
Flowers in April. Found in one or two locali- 
ties only in England, and regarded as a very 
doubtful native. It is, nevertheless, a very 
beautiful little plant for the garden, and con- 
trasts well with the preceding species. 

These wild forms of Anemones, no less 
than the garden ones, are worth cultivating for 
the sake of their early and lively flowers, which, 
however, in the case of A. nemorosa and A. ra- 
nuncidoides, are most suitable for shady situa- 
tions. Wherever there exists what is called a 
"wilderness," or a shrubbery, with walks pass- 
ing through it, the wild Anemones should be 
largely planted, along with the winter aconite, 
the harebell, the snowdrop, and some others. 
They require no care in cultivation. Wher- 
ever they are introduced into more dressy gar- 
den scenes, it should be in a position where 
the roots may remain undisturbed from one 
season to another. Thus they may be planted 
along the margins of flower-beds, or borders, 
and will flower gaily in the spring, dying clown 
and making room for other plants in the summer 
and autumn. For such positions the double- 
flowered variety is preferable. They may be 
planted in beds, where the roots can be so ar- 
ranged as to leave space for other successional 
plants to come between them. ThePasque flower 
may be managed as an ordinary perennial. 

CONIFERS. THE PINUS, OR PINE-TREE. 

The paper at p. 77, relating to Pine-trees, 
included that division of the genus Pinus, in 
which the species produce — usually — two of 
their needle-shaped leaves within each of the 
scaly sheaths peculiar to the foliage of these 
plants. The species here described, are those 
which produce three leaves in a sheath. There 
is still another group, which have the leaves 
arranged in bundles of five together.

Pinus sinensis, Lambert (Chinese Pine). — 
Leaves three in a sheath ; in some instances, 
two together, of the colour of those of the 
stone pine ; five inches long, very slender, 
serrulated, semicylindrical. Sheaths cylindri- 
cal, half an inch long. Cones two to three 
inches long, almost sessile, ovate, brown, with 
thick flattened truncate scales. Buds without 
resin. 

A native of China, where it rises to a large 
tree. Professor Royle considers it as a variety 
only of the Pinus Pinaster, and that it is 
identical with the pine found on the Khoosea 
Hills. In the garden of Mr. Wells, of Red- 
leaf, and at Carclew, in Cornwall, are the 
finest specimens in England. It is by no 
means well suited to the climate of Britain ; 
but its constitution might be somewhat im- 
proved by grafting on P. sylvestris. 

Pinus canariensis, C. Smith (Canary Pine). 
— Leaves three, rough-edged, seven inches 
long, slender, wavy, grass-green. Buds one 
quarter inch long, scaly, of a whitish colour, 
and free from resin. Cones oblong, five or 
six inches in length, with thick woody scales, 
truncate. 

A gigantic tree rising amidst the desolation 
of nature on the vexed soil of Teneriffe. It 
takes its station about 5000 feet above the 
level of the sea, much higher than " the 
region of laurels," in the midst of loose rocks, 
masses of lava, and terrific precipices. In this 



tree is perceived a beautiful adaptation of 
nature in working out the sublime. The 
plant is of a bold, almost savage outline, with 
great sinewy arms, and is admirably fitted, 
along with other striking accompaniments, to 
"conquer the mind" of the beholder. Un- 
fortunately, however, it assumes not this com- 
manding character in England, for so far as 
it has been tried, it has shrunk from the 
severity of the climate. The wood is repre- 
sented as resinous, not subject to the attacks 
of worms, and lasting for many centuries. A 
fine specimen stands in the pinetum at Drop- 
more, and there are also trees of this species 
in the Hackney nursery, and in the garden of 
the Horticultural Society. Those who have 
cuttings, should graft them on P. sylvestris. 

Pinus insignis, Douglas (noble Pine).— 
Leaves generally three, sometimes four, wavy, 
irregularly arranged, grass-green, and about 
three inches long. Buds one quarter inch long, 
free from resin, resembling those of P. Sabi- 
niana. Cones bright brown, ovate, with de- 
pressed scales, the lowermost hooked back. 

A beautiful tree, having bright grass-green 
leaves, differing from every other species known 
in England. Introduced by Douglas, in 1833. 
In the Horticultural Society's Garden, the 
Hackney Arboretum, and at Belsay, in Nor- 
thumberland, Hendon Rectory, and Chats- 
worth, are good specimens. It is a free 
grower, but rather too tender for the climate 
of Britain. Nevertheless, it should be in 
every collection ; and to obviate the high price 
charged for it, (1/. Is.,) slips should be grafted

CONIFERS. — THE PINUS, OR PIXE TREE. 



on the P. sylvestris. Mr. Locke, of Eozelle, 
Ayrshire, says, " Of all the most ornamental 
pines, this is the most striking here : the 
foliage is of a beautiful delicate green, the 
plant making sometimes two shoots in a 
season, yet never injured by frost. The an- 
nual growths average three feet ; therefore, 
whether it be a valuable timber tree or not, it 
is certainly an object of much interest as an 
ornament in the pleasure-ground. All our 
plants, though quite exposed in winter, have 
never been injured in any way." 

Pinus Teocote, Schiede (Ocote Pine). — 
Leaves three, light green, scabrous, wavy. 
Cones smooth, ovate, with angular blunt 
scales ; in shape, like those of P. sylvestris. 

A lofty tree, growing on Mount Orizaba, in 
Mexico, and introduced by the late Mr. Lam- 
bert, of Boyton, where the only fine specimen 
in this country is to be seen. The species 
succeeds well in Scotland; thriving plants 
being found both at Rozelle and Ballindalloch. 
The properties of the timber of this tree are 
as yet unknown. Its ornamental character is 
admitted on all hands ; but it is difficult to be 
had even in the first nurseries. From the 
altitude of its native habitat, it will, in all 
probability, withstand our winters without 
injury. 

Pinus cembroides, Zuccarini (Cembra-like 
Pine). — Leaves in threes, from an inch to an 
inch and a half long, rigid, and of a light 
green colour. Cones, stalkless, and growing 
singly, from two to three inches long, and 
nearly two inches broad at the base, with six 
or seven rows of scales, rounded at the margin, 
and enclosing two wingless top-shaped seeds. 
The branches grow in whorls, mostly five 
together, but sometimes more numerous ; they 
are slender, and slightly incurved, have toler- 
ably smooth bark, and remarkably small buds, 
nearly, or quite without resin. 

A low growing handsome tree of about 
thirty feet high, with much the general 
appearance and foliage of P. Llaveana, with 
which the late Mr. Loudon identified it. It 
is, however, a very different, and perfectly 
new plant, having much smaller leaves, and 
cones three or four times larger. The plant 
has recently been raised by the Horticultural 
Society from seeds, collected by Mr. Hartweg, 
on the cold districts of the mountain Orizaba, 
at an elevation of 10,000 feet above the sea. 
There is little doubt of this plant proving to 
be perfectly hardy in our gardens, as its 
habitat on the cold elevated tracks of Orizaba 
would seem to indicate. 

Pinus Llaveana, Schiede (La Llave's Pine). 
— Leaves generally in threes, often in twos, 
sometimes in fours, short, narrow, twisted, 
glaucous, and tufted. Cones two inches and 
a quarter long, with three rows of prominent 



obtuse scales. Seeds large and eatable. Buds 
very small. 

A handsome low tree, growing twenty 
or thirty feet high, found in the mountain 
forests of Mexico, between Zimapan and 
Real del Oro. It is perfectly hardy in Eng- 
land. According to Mr. Loudon, there is a 
good specimen of it in the Arboretum at 
Chiswick, and that author recommends its 
being grafted on P. halepensis, to which it 
bears a resemblance. 

Pinus patula, Schiede (spreading-leaved 
Pine). — Leaves in threes, recurved and spread- 
ing, slender, of a soft light green, about seven 
inches long, the margins serrated. Cones 
polished, ovate-oblong, four inches long, with 
angular truncated scales, prominent, yet small. 
A lofty tree, found on high mountains in 
the northern provinces of Mexico, and giving 
every promise of being useful and ornamental 
in this country. The finest plant in Britain 
is at Boyton, the seat of Mr. Lambert, and it 
is also to be seen at Rozelle, in Ayrshire, six 
feet in height. • It is there considered a 
" lovely" pine. 

b. Scales of cones spiny at apex. 

Pinus australis, Michaux (southern Pine). 
— The leaves three in a sheath, eight inches 
long, grass-green, in clusters at the tip of the 
branches. Buds half an inch long, and with- 
out resin. Cones about eight inches long, and 
two and a half inches broad at the widest 
part, ovate- oblong ; scales depressed, armed 
with small prickles. 

The synonymes of this tree are numerous : 
the following are its most common designa- 
tions : — P. palustris, P. serotina, and P. 
americana palustris. Throughout America, 
it is inown as the pitch pine, yellow pine, 
long-leaved pine, broom pine, and red pine : 
the timber merchants of Britain call it the 
Georgia Pitch Pine. 

One of the finest timber trees of America, 
producing strong, compact, and durable wood : 
and well known to the British timber mer- 
chant. The species has been cultivated in 
England for upw r ards of a century, yet it is 
by no means common in arboretum?, and 
much less so in plantations. In the treatment 
of this tree, two very important points seem 
to have been overlooked, and the writer has 
the greatest confidence in recommending them 
to the notice of British arboriculturists. 1st. 
The tree will, in all probability, succeed along 
the sea shore, it being found in maritime 
situations in its native country. The sea air 
checks the intensity of frost, against wdiich, 

J in inland situations, it is certainly unable 
to bear up. 2dly. The soil in wdiich it is 
planted should be little better than that which

to the plant being, that it produces more wood 
than it can mature or ripen. Thus Mr. 
Locke, of Rozelle, speaking of this species, 
says, " the severity of the winter destroys the 
half-ripened wood." Tracing the tree over 
its original habitations, it is very evident that 
it is especially fitted for the most barren tracts 
that can be found. The remarks of Michaux 
on this head "are particularly worthy of atten- 
tion. " Towards the north," he says, " the 
long-leaved pine first makes its appearance 
near Norfolk, in Virginia, where the pine 
barrens begin. It seems to be especially as- 
signed to dry sandy soils ; and it is found, 
almost without interruption, in the lower part 
of the Carolinas, Georgia, and the Floridas, 
over a tract of more than 600 miles long from 
north-east to south-west, and more than 100 
miles broad from the sea towards the moun- 
tains of the Carolinas and Georgia. Where 
it begins to show itself towards the river 
Nuse, it is united with the Loblolly pine 
(Pinus Tcedci), the yellow pine {P. miiis), 
the pond pine (P. serotinoi), the black jack 
oak (Quercus nigra), and the scrub oak (Q. 
Bannisteri) : but, immediately beyond Raleigh, 
it holds almost exclusive possession of the 
soil, and is seen in company with the pines 
just mentioned, only on the edges of the 
swamps enclosed in the barrens ; even there, 
not more than one tree in a hundred is of 
another species. "With this exception, the 
long-leaved pine forms the unbroken mass of 
woods which covers this extensive country ; 
but, between Fayetteville and Wilmington, 
in North Carolina, the scrub oak is found in 
some districts, mixed with it in the barrens ; 
and except this sj)ecies of pine, it is the only 
tree capable of subsisting on so dry and sterile 
a soil" 

In Georgia, the Carolinas, and Floridas, al- 
most all the houses are built of it ; and in the 
southern states it is used to the exclusion of 
all others in ship-building. It commands a 
much higher price in the British and West 
Indian markets than the other pines of the 
United States, and with the exception per- 
haps of P. Strobus, it would be difficult to 
select any other tree which has contributed so 
much to the comfort and convenience of man 
throughout the civilized world. Plants are 
3s. 6d. each. 

Variety. — P. a. excelsa, a plant raised by 
Mr. Booth, of the Flotbeck nurseries, in 1830, 
much hardier than the species, and considered 
to be a more rapid grower. It is not yet 
common in collections. 

Pinus Tceda, Linnaeus (Frankincense, or Lob- 
lolly Pine). — Leaves in threes, five and a half 
inches long, narrow, bluntly pointed, channeled 
in the middle, nearly straight. Cones somewhat 
curved, four inches long, with compressed 



scales, woody, and armed with a sharp point, 
often in pairs, oblong-pyramidal. Buds of a 
brownish red, covered with resinous exudation. 
A tree growing to the height of 90 feet, in 
barren sandy districts from Florida to Vir- 
ginia. Sent from America to Mr. Ball of 
Fxeter, and to Dr. Compton, bishop of Lon- 
don, about the beginning of the eighteenth 
century. The tree grows rapidly, with loose 
annual layers, and it is consequently of little 
value. The nature of the soil, however, in- 
fluences the quality of the wood, and on poor 
exposed districts its timber is of a closer fibre. 
Compared with P. australis, its concentric 
circles are as 1 to 12 in the same space, so 
that in bulk of wood, it furnishes itself twelve 
times faster than the other. Pursh says, that 
" all the woods in the southern states of Ame- 
rica must be thickly seeded with it ; for no 
sooner are lands which are exhausted aban- 
doned, than they are overrun with young trees 
of this species." One of the handsomest trees 
in Europe is at Paine's Hill, and there are 
good specimens at Syon, Whitton, and Kew. 
Generally, it does not grow well in Britain. 
Probably it might thrive better on dry sandy 
soils near to the sea. Plants in the London 
nurseries are about 2s. 6d. each. 

A variety, under the name of P. T. alope- 
curoidea, is found in some catalogues ; but 
judging from the tree in the Horticultural So- 
ciety's Garden, it differs not from the species. 
Pinus serotina, Michaux (late, or Pond 
Pine). — Leaves three, six inches long. Cones 
from two and a half to three inches long, 
broad, egg-shaped. Scales broad, depressed 
at the apex, terminating in a slender prickle, 
which is easily broken off. 

A small tree only, growing to the height of 
40 feet, on the edges of ponds and swamps 
from New Jersey to Carolina, attaining to its 
greatest size towards maritime situations. The 
timber is altogether worthless, unless for fire- 
wood ; but as an ornament it is well worthy 
of a place in every pinetum. It seems to grow 
best in soil which has one-half bog earth in it, 
and which is moist. There is a tree at Lrop- 
more about 40 feet high. 

Pinus rigicla, Miller (rigid or Pitch 
Pine). — Leaves in threes, four inches long, va- 
riable. Cones ovate, clustered, almost sessile, 
with rugged compressed pyramidal scales, 
ending in a prickle. Trunk lofty, straight. 

A large tree, found throughout most parts 
of the United States, growing in some in- 
stances to the height of 80 feet ; but varying 
very much both in its appearance and altitude 
according to the soil which it may happen to 
affect. When the trees are in masses, the 
cones grow singly, shedding their seeds the 
first autumn after they are ripe ; but on iso- 
lated trees, the cones are in clusters of four or

five, and remain on the trees unopened for 
several years. On good soil, the concentric 
circles of the wood are distant ; but on poor 
exposed situations, the wood produced is com- 
pact and full of resin, as its name of pitch- 
pine imports. It is sometimes used in house- 
building, and especially for flooring, the resin 
with which it is imbued rendering it durable. 
Its chief use is to furnish tar, of which large 
quantities are made from it. Dropmore, 
Hackney Arboretum, Carclew in Cornwall, 
and Hendon, are the places in this country 
where it is to be seen in greatest perfection. 

Pi?uts ponderosa, Douglas (heavy-wooded 
Pine). — Leaves three together, thickly set, 
one foot long, nearly straight, and in short 
sheaths of a dark colour. Cones egg-shaped, 
oblong, with strong pyramidal scales, terminat- 
ing in a recurved spine. Buds one inch in 
length, reddish-brown, covered with fine par- 
ticles of resin. 

A tree discovered by Douglas on the coast 
of North America, and one full of promise to 
the British arboriculturist. This is a beauti- 
fully-shaped, fast-growing, noble object, with 
few well-regulated branches ; which, when 
old, assume a graceful drooping habit. Of the 
character of its wood, the discoverer has said 
nothing; and in this respect it, in all probability, 
partakes of that looseness of fibre character- 
istic of the great majority of North American 
pines. At the same time, its specific name 
would imply the very reverse, and the question 
remains to be ascertained. Of its success in 
the climate of Scotland, the writer can speak 
with certainty. Plants of it in the more ex- 
posed districts of Moray shire, grow at the rate 
of two and a half feet in one season ; and at 
Rozelle in Ayrshire, " everything connected 
with it supports the hypothesis, that it will 
ultimately prove a very valuable timber tree" 
in that country. The specimens there are 
upwards of 20 feet in height, carrying with 
them proportionate strength both in stem and 
branches. A very general objection is urged 
against this tree, that of its being unable to 
support itself when finally planted out. The 
objection is misapplied : it belongs to the 
nursery culture of the tree, and not to any 
peculiarity in the plant itself. Pot-culture is 
a good enough plan, and quite indispensable ; 
but it has its limits, which are frequently over- 
stepped. Such a pine as this should not be 
kept in pots beyond three years, when it should 
be turned into the open ground, and subjected 
to a course of shifting every two years. Its 
removal every two years would compel it to 
furnish itself with properly directed leading 
roots, and with an abundance of small fibres, 
which would not fail to support it, when placed 
in an exposed situation for life. Plants are 
from Gs, to 10*. each ; and at this rate, planters 



are surely entitled to have such as are well- 
rooted. 

Pinus Coulteri, Don (Coulter's, or great 
hooked Pine). — Leaves three, ten inches long, 
slightly serrated on the margin, glaucous, two- 
furrowed on the upper side. Cones solitary, 
oblong, very large, with woody wedge-shaped 
horned scales, each one weighing about 3| lbs. 
Seeds flat, brownish, rather more than half 
an inch in length. Young shoots covered with 
a violet-coloured glaucous bloom. 

A lofty tree discovered by Dr. Coulter and 
by Douglas, about 1831, growing on the moun- 
tains of Santa Lucia, " in latitude 36 degrees, 
within sight of the sea, and at an elevation of 
from 3000 feet to 4000 feet above its level." 
It was found along with P. Lamberticma, rising 
to 80 feet and 100 feet in height, having a trunk 
about 3^ feet in diameter, with thick roaming 
branches. It is altogether so like the next 
pine here described, that many botanists have 
considered them varieties only of the same 
species. The foliage of this tree is a little 
more, fastigiate ; but the buds, leaves, and 
young shoots are exactly alike. The cones 
are larger than those in Sabine's variety or 
species; and what is rather unusual, the seeds 
are smaller. It forms a gigantic and lovely 
tree, quite a prize in the eyes of every arbori- 
culturist, is a quick grower, and perfectly 
hardy even in the climate of Scotland. When 
grafted or inarched on any other species, the 
junction should be made as near to the root as 
possible, and the bottom of the graft fretted or 
cut so as to induce it to throw out roots for it- 
self. It is cruel to plant such a tree on soil 
which is not loosened and prepared to the depth 
at least of 3 feet. There are good specimens 
at Kew, Hendon Rectory, and the Horticul- 
tural Society's Garden. 

Phuts Sabiniana, Douglas (Sabine's, or 
great prickly-coned Pine). — Leaves three, one 
foot in length, glaucous in every stage of their 
growth; sharp and round on the outside, and 
towards the point serrated. Sheaths one inch 
long, ash-brown, ringed. Cones surrounding 
the stem like those of P. Pinaster, remaining 
on the trees for several years, about 1 1 inches 
long, roundish ovate, with large scales bearing 
sharp incurved points like a hawk's bill. 

A tree discovered by Douglas, in 1826, and 
named by him in compliment to his friend, 
Mr. Sabine. Found in greatest perfection on 
the deep vegetable deposits on the flanks of the 
Cordilleras of New Albion, in California ; 
where it attains the height of 130 feet, and 
when standing alone, is feathered to the ground 
with branches. Plants were raised in the 
Horticultural Society's Garden in 1832 ; and 
in the arboretum there, is one of the finest 
specimens in England. In Scotland it is as 
hardy as any other pine, and promises to be

one of those which will be extensively culti- 
vated for ornament. Seedling plants are not 
yet common in nurseries, and grafted plants 
do not appear to grow well. Mr. Locke of 
Rozelle, Ayrshire, says, " Of this excellent 
and scarce pine we have several specimens ; 
but unfortunately, until very lately, w r e were 
unable to procure a seedling plant, and there- 
fore this report of it must refer to grafted 
plants only. One of our plants, however, 
about two years since, having shown signs of 
roots at the junction of the graft with the 
stock, I had the curiosity to try to bring the 
roots into the soil, by drawing a little leaf- 
mould and sand around the plant. I am happy 
to say, I have been well rewarded ; for the 
soil is now filled with roots, and the tree is 
thriving exceedingly. This pine approaches 
nearer to the Pinus ponder osa than any other 
I know. It is perfectly hardy here, and is 
now making growth annually about 18 inches 
in length." The wood of this pine is white 
and soft, and not likely to be very durable. 

Pinus longifolia, Roxburgh (long-leaved 
Indian Pine). — Leaves three together, about a 
foot in length, but varying in some instances 
from eight to eighteen inches, drooping, slen- 
der, of a vivid green, channelled, and serrated. 
Cones less than half the length of the leaves, 
< blong-ovate, rugged, dark brown, with corky 
lecurved scales. 

A native of North Hindostan, on the moun- 
tains of Nepal, and on the great range of the 
Himalayas, which bounds that kingdom. It is 
cultivated throughout Upper India on account 
of the peculiar gracefulness of its habit. The 
tree affects various localities, being found on 
high mountains, and in valleys where the heat 
is intense. Hence a majority of the plants of 
this species raised in Britain are too tender 
for this climate ; whilst others are nearly 
hardy enough to withstand the rigours of our 
winters. In some parts of the Himalayas this 
tree attains to the height of 100 feet, having 
a few short branches which become drooping. 
Lawson suggests, and with reason, that if 
seeds were gathered from those trees on the 
Himalaya only, the plants produced would, in 
all probability, prove hardy enough to grow 
in this country without protection. Plants in 
the London nurseries are from 10s. to 15s. 
each. 

Variety. — P. I. Timorietisis, Loudon. — So 
called on account of its having been sent from 
Timor, one of the Molucca Islands, to Mr. 
Lambert at Boy ton. Leaves three, rather 
more slender than P. longifolia, of a darker 
green, eight inches long. There is a tree 
upwards of twenty feet high at Boyton, but, 
so far as the writer knows, it has not yet 
borne cones, and its reference to P. longifolia 
wants confirmation. 
48. 



Pinus Gerardiana, Wallich (Gerard's, 
or short-leaved Nepal Pine). — Leaves three, 
short, straight, glaucous, with deciduous 
sheaths. Cones like those of P. longifolia. 
Seeds dark brown, pointed at both ends, and 
eatable. 

A large conical-crowned tree, discovered 
by Captain Gerard, of the Bengal Native 
Infantry, and named in honour of him, by 
Dr. Wallich. It has been often confounded 
with P. longifolia, and seeds have in some 
instances been sent home, which have turned 
out to be P. Pinea. In the Fulham nursery, 
and at Messrs. Low's, at Clapton, plants of 
the true species are propagated ; and at Flit- 
wick in Bedfordshire, Elvaston Castle in Der- 
byshire, and Hendon Rectory in Middlesex, 
there are fine specimens many years planted. 
From its being a native of the coldest parts 
of the Himalayas, and the bleakest side of 
those mountains, little doubt is entertained of 
its hardiness in the climate of Britain. In 
Scotland it gives promise of withstanding the 
winters without protection. 

Pinus californiana, Loiseleur (Californian 
Pine). — Leaves generally three together, some- 
times only two, three inches long, slender, deep 
green. Cone in form and appearance like 
that of P. Pinaster, but considerably larger. 

A scarce species found in the neighbour- 
hood of Monte-Rey in California, and repre- 
sented to bear cones somewhat similar to the 
P. Pinaster, but in every respect larger. 
One of the few specimens in this country, is 
in the garden of the Horticultural Society, a 
grafted plant, under the name of P. vion- 
tlieragensiSs received from M. Godefroy, a 
nurseryman in Paris, about the year 1829. 
Professor Thouin thus describes it : — 

" This tree grows, in the neighbourhood of 
Monte-Rey. One of its cones, gathered by 
Colladon, the gardener belonging to the expe- 
dition of La Peyrouse, was sent to the mu- 
seum of Natural History in Paris, in 1787. 
The cone was in the form of that of P. 
Pinaster, but one-third larger in all its parts. 
Under each of the scales w r ere found two seeds 
of the size of those of P. Cembra, and of 
which the kernel was good to eat. From 
these seeds, sown in the Jardin des Plantes, 
a plant was raised, which has stood for several 
years in the open ground ; where, without 
being vigorous, it remains in health." It is 
not suited to the climate of this country. 

Pinus Fraseri, Loddiges (Eraser's Pine). 
— In all probability a mere nominal species, 
referable to P. rigida. It is found in several 
nurserymen's catalogues, and was originally 
sent from the Liverpool Botanic Garden. A 
fine specimen, from loft, to 20ft. high, is 
said to be in the arboretum of the Hackney 
nursery.

COX1FER.E. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



Pinus muricata, Don (smaller prickly, 
coned Pine). — Leaves not seen by the writer, 
hut supposed by Don to be in threes. Cones 
in clusters, unequally sided, three inches long, 
ovate. Scales flattened at the top, wedge- 
shaped, mucronate or sharp-pointed. 

Represented to be a middle-sized tree, a 
native of San Luis in California, growing 
about 3000 feet above the level of the sea, 
and very likely to prove hardy in the climate 
of Britain. A cone is figured in Loudon's 
Arboretum Britannicum, p. 2269 ; but no 
plants are as yet known to be in England. 
A straight stunted tree not exceeding 40 feet 
in height. 

Pinus tuberculata, Don, (tuberculated 
Pine). — This species is described by Don as 
reaching to the height of 100 feet. Cones 
three in a cluster, of a tawny grey, 4 inches 
long, 2\ inches broad, the scales being wedge- 
shaped, dilated at the apex, quadrangular, 
truncate, with a depressed umbilicus ; larger 
at the external base, conical, with an elevated 
apex. Found by Dr. Coulter along with the 
next species here described, (P. radiata.) 
which it resembles in size and habit, but is 
essentially distinguished by the form of its 
eones. See Linnean Transactions, vol. xvii. 
p. 442. The specimen leaves of this tree 
were not to be found when the cones arrived 
in this country, Dr. Coulter having had " no 
convenient opportunity to arrange his vast 
collections." 

Pinus radiata, Don (radiated scaled Pine). 
— Leaves thought to be in threes. Cones 
ovate, with unequal sides. Scales radiately 
cleft, truncate, with a depressed umbilicus ; 
gibbous, somewhat recurved, and three times 
as large at their external base. 

" Found by Dr. Coulter, about Monte-Rey, 
in latitude 36°, near the level of the sea, and 
growing almost close to the beach. The trees 
grow singly, and reach the height of 100 feet, 
with a straight trunk, feathered with branches 
almost to the ground. This species affords 
excellent timber, which is very tough, and 
admirably adapted for building boats, for 
which purpose it is much used." — D. Don, in 
Linnean Society s Transactions, vol. xvii. 
p. 442. 

The preceding section contains several new 
and untried species of pines. Those from 
California are particularly interesting ; and 
there is no doubt that the botanist now (1847) 
exploring that country, under the auspices of 
the London Horticultural Society, will be able 
to make further additions to this magnificent 
genus. The lamented Douglas laboured suc- 
cessfully in this field ; yet it appears that Dr. 
Coulter, who succeeded him, was equally if not 
more fortunate, in introducing several of the 
same family. " The soil and climate of those 



regions, especially the western flanks of the 
northern Andes, and the extensive parallel 
ranges of mountains which extend from south 
to north through California, appear to be pe- 
culiarly favourable to the development and 
growth of the fir tribe," and it may therefore 
be expected that Mr. Hartweg's labours will 
not be in vain. 

Some of the species are remarkable for their 
rapid growth, and are well fitted to take the 
place of our fast growing deciduous plants, 
such as poplars and willows. The chief of 
these appears to be P. ponderosa, which, when 
favourably situated, proceeds at the rate of 
three feet per annum. 

In this section are several individuals valu- 
able on account of the timber which they pro- 
duce, and no less so as a contribution to our 
parks and pleasure-grounds simply as orna- 
ments. The voice of the past has not indeed 
directed us to those objects, for they appear to 
have grown up in their vast habitations almost 
unnoticed and unhonoured ; but, judging from 
the character they have already exhibited in 
this country, the future will be more eloquent 
in their praise. 

The writer has had abundant evidence of the 
fact, with regard to our recently introduced 
Coniferas, that the deep trenching of the soil 
in which they are planted, is a powerful in- 
ducement to reconcile themselves to the cli- 
mate of Britain. As already observed, one of 
the best models of planting was executed by 
the late Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, who had 
upwards of one hundred acres of poor land 
trenched and filled with fine pines, &c, in the 
parishes of Runton and Trimingham, Norfolk. 
There our scarcest and most expensive species 
are thriving almost as well as those which have 
been long inured to the climate ; and there is 
little doubt but that this has been accom- 
plished chiefly by the thorough loosening of the 
sub-soil. The poorness of the soil is of very 
little consequence to pines, so long as their 
spongioles can descend freely in search of 
support. In fact, there is no race of trees so 
well suited as the present family, to cover 
tracts of sandy soil, which are intuitively re- 
garded as being of a barren nature. In such 
situations, however, the breaking up and 
loosening of the subsoil is of much importance 
to their success. Where iron exists in any 
quantity in soils of this kind, which have for 
many years been suffered to lie w T aste, a cake 
or " pan " is formed by the uniting of vegetable 
acids with the particles of iron, and the pan of 
iron conglomerate thus formed, not only pre- 
vents the roots from obtaining firm hold of the 
soil, but also prevents the downward passage 
of water ; it is, therefore, of great importance 
that where it exists within three feet of the 
surface, it should be broken up.

BASS FOR TYING PLANTS. 

The bass, or material of which the garden 
(Russian) mats are formed, is commonly used 
for all the lighter tying which is necessary in 
gardens. This bass is the inner layers of the 
bark of the lime-tree (Tilia europtsa). The 
bark of lime-trees grown in this country is 
nearly or quite equal to the Russian. To 
obtain it, the timber, after being cut, must be 
laid up for twelve months, in a dry place, and 
the bark may then be stripped off; the inner 
layers being suitable for fine tying ; the outer 
layers are coarser, and serve for strong rough 
tying. During 1846, attention was directed 
to another kind of bass, called Cuba Bass, 
from being commonly sent around packages 
of cigars which come from thence. This is 
now introduced for gardening purposes ; it is 
full of long narrow meshes, or openings, 
somewhat resembling lace, and is brought 
over in long ribbon -like strips ; it is rather 
stubborn in texture, but very strong, and 
splitting readily into narrow portions, thus 
being suitable either for strong or light ties. 
It is not known by what tree it is produced. 
Another material of this kind has been 
recently exhibited at a meeting of the Horti- 
cultural Society. This is found in Madagas- 
car, where it is used by the natives in making 
ropes, in which state it has sometimes reached 
England. It is said to be the produce of a 
" grass-tree," and has the appearance of being 
the long narrow foliage of some such plant ; 
but what plant it is which produces it is as 
yet unknown. This occurs in long strips, 
much narrower, apparently, than the Cuba 
Bass ; it is very soft and fine, and remarkably 
tough, it being difficult to break even a very 
thin piece of it ; it splits readily into fine 
strands, and will, therefore, be exceedingly 
well adapted for all fine tying, being light and 
fine, as well as strong ; and in thicker pieces, 
or two or three together, will make a very 
strong coarse tie. A supply of it is likely to 
be obtained for garden purposes. It is by far 
the best material of the kind that has yet 
been brought into notice. 



THE .ESCHYNANTHUS. 

One of the most ornamental families of 
tropical plants, is that which bears the scien- 
tific name JEschynantlms, a word derived 
from aischuno (to be ashamed,) and anthos 
(a flower,) and for which the Anglicised equi- 
valent of Blushwort has been proposed by Dr. 
Lindley. This latter term is not, however, 
generally adopted ; names of this latter cha- 



racter — that is, trivial names — not being very 
extensively employed, on account of their 
inconvenience and want of preciseness for 
scientific purposes, and the little real utility 
attending their use, as far as unscientific per- 
sons are concerned. The name .iEschynanthus 
has also been proposed to be adapted to our 
language by a modification of the last syllable ; 
thus we have JEscliynanth, which in the plural 
form becomes .ZEschynanths. 

The iEschynanths belong to a group of 
plants, to which the term Cyrtandracese has 
been applied. This group is by some regarded 
cs a distinct order in the so-called Natural 
System of Botany, while by others it is con- 
sidered as a subordinate group of the natural 
order Gesneraceae. The difference in these 
views is more apparent than real, and results 
principally from those holding the latter opi- 
nion taking a more comprehensive view than 
the others, of what constitutes the limits of a 
natural order. Illustrating this by a familiar 
example, we may say that the actual geogra- 
phical position of London would be undis- 
turbed, whether it were regarded as a distinct 
county, or part of the county of Middlesex ; 
and in like manner, the botanical position of 
JEschynanthus is unaffected whether Cyrtan- 
draceas, the group of plants in which it is in- 
cluded, is regarded as a separate order, or a 
section of the larger order Gesneraceae. 

All the iEschynanths are epiphytal plants, 
that is, they are found growing in the same 
way as the orchids, upon the trees of tropical 
forests. These all differ from parasites, such 
as the mistletoe, which draws nourishment 
from the tree on which it grows ; epiphytes, 
on the contrary, derive nothing but a location 
from the trees to which they are found 
attached, and derive their nourishment from 
the moisture and gaseous elements of the air 
which surrounds them, and from the decaying 
vegetable matter which may have lodged upon 
the branches where they are fixed. From this 
similarity in habit and general character, the 
-ZEschynanths and orchids associate well to- 
gether in artificial cultivation. 

The plants under consideration may be 
grown, either attached to blocks of wood, or 
planted in open baskets, such as are used for 
orchids, or potted with very loose open mate- 
rial about their roots. In the former case, the 
blocks should be charred before the plants are 
fixed to them, and the roots should be neatly 
enveloped with sphagnum moss, placed be- 
neath and above them, and fastened on to the 
block by means of fine zinc or copper wire 
fastened to copper tacks ; a small tack is also 
to be securely driven into each end of the 
block, to which a piece of wire is attached, as a 
handle for the purpose of suspending it from 
the roof of the house. In this case, the moss 
k 2 



132 



THE JES CHYNA^ THUS. 



is to be kept moistened by occasional syringing. 
It the plants are placed in open baskets, they 
should be planted amongst lumps of charcoal, 
and turfy portions of peat soil, about the size 
of walnuts, mixed with sphagnum moss cut 
moderately fine, and a little leaf-mould ; and 
this material must be placed together loosely in 
the baskets: the plants should be planted rather 
shallow. When the baskets are made of wire. 
either copper or the galvanized iron wire should 
be used, as the common iron wire soon corrodes. 
Of wooden baskets, those formed of bamboo rods 
are the neatest, and most durable ; but if this 
material is not available, such as oak or hazel 
rods will do, but they are the better for being 
slightly charred, as this prevents their rapid 
decay. "When they are grown in pots, a soil 
similar to that recommended for baskets must 
be employed, and the pots must be well 
drained, thus : — a smaller pot nearly as large 
as can be got to stand in the bottom, is to be 
inverted in the larger pot, and around this 
pieces of broken crock, or charcoal, or both 
mixed, are to be filled in nearly level with the 
inverted pots ; on this, the soil and the plants, 
potted rather high, are to be placed. Young 
plants may be raised in the spring, and are 
best kept in pots, potted in soil similar to that 
already recommended, but made a little finer 
to suit the size of the pots they are growing 
in, and with the addition of a portion of 
rotten wood. When they are well established, 
or by the following March, they can be trans- 
ferred either to the blocks, baskets, or to larger 
pots for blooming : in either case the old soil 
should be removed from about their roots, and 
carefully replaced by some in a fresh state. 
When grown permanently in pots, the plants 
may be fastened to a rough block of wood, 
and this placed in the pot, and filled round 
with the materials already named. We have 
seen them grown very successfully, managed in 
this way. When the plan of growing them 
attached to blocks of wood is preferred, the 
plants require dressing before they are excited 
to grow each year ; the old moss should in 
great part be removed from the roots, and 
replaced by fresh ; any decaying roots or 
branches should be cut away, and in case there 
may beany straggling shoots which destroy the 
symmetry of the plants, this is the proper 
period to remove or cut them back. 

Sometimes the walls of the orchid house or 
stove are covered over with plants, or in other 
cases there exists a portion of rustic work, or 
rock work within the house ; for such situa- 
tions, the JEschynanths would be exceedingly 
appropriate, and under such circumstances 
they would have a fine effect ; in this case, 
their branches would be allowed to hang in their 
natural character, entirely without restraint. 
When introduced in this way, they should be 



attached to large pieces of rough bark fastened 
to the wall or rock, and may be supplied with 
a small portion of sphagnum moss. 

The natural habit of these plants is depen- 
dent, and they look best when allowed to 
assume this habit unrestrainedly, for then the 
branches hang over and conceal the pots or 
baskets in which they are growing, and the 
position assumed by the flowers has a more 
natural and elegant appearance than under any 
other arrangement. This plan is, however, 
inconvenient in the case of large plants, when 
it is required to remove them from one place 
to another ; and hence, when they are in pots, 
the branches are sometimes disposed over a 
roundish trellis, and when they are not too 
rigidly trained in, they look very well in this 
way : sometimes also, they are slightly sup- 
ported by a few stakes, and made to form the 
outline of a dense bush ; and when grown in 
this way, if the points of the young shoot have 
their liberty, so as to fall into something like 
their natural curves, the effect is very good ; 
those kinds which possess the most decidedly 
branching habit are most proper for this mode 
of training. 

The orchid house, or where there is no 
such place, the stove, or stove pit, is the pro- 
per habitation of the JEschynanths. The con- 
ditions which are kept up in an orchid house, 
viz. vigorous heat and abundant atmospheric 
moisture without exposure to cold draughts, 
exactly suit them when in a growing state. 
In the summer, when they are blooming freely, 
they may be kept in a somewhat drier atmo- 
sphere, such as a warm greenhouse, which 
would be very suitable for them then; and in the 
winter, when they are in a state of inactivity, 
they may be kept comparatively dry, and in a 
cool part of the stove, or even in a good green- 
house. In the growing season they should 
be syringed with tepid water once or twice a 
day, and kept moderately moist at the root ; 
and when in bloom and removed to a drier 
atmosphere, they must be kept regularly sup- 
plied with water. In removing them at this 
period of their development, the change 
must not be too suddenly brought on them, 
but by degrees. 

All the species propagate readily by means 
of cuttings planted in sandy peat soil, and 
plunged in a gentle bottom heat. "When 
young the plants should be freely stopped to 
secure a proper number of branches to form a 
handsome plant. 

In no genus has there been such an acces- 
sion of new and beautiful species during the 
past year as in the iEschynanthus, and with 
these additions it offers a very tempting in- 
ducement to amateur cultivators who delight 
in taking up and patronising particular fancy 
genera. There seems no reason why hybrid- 



THE jESCHYNANTHUS. 



133 



ising should fail in this case, any more than 
in others, to produce a greater variety than 
the wild exotic species afford. 

The following is a connected view of the 
kinds which are now in cultivation in this 
country ; and it may be remarked that the 
first three which are named are often con- 
founded in gardens : — 

^schynanthusra??iosi$swius,Wal\iQ:'h (much 
branching Blushwort or iEschynanth). — A 
shrubby sub-scandent branching plant, with 
opposite elliptic oblong pointed leaves of a 
fleshy (as in all the species) substance, and 
terminal crowded umbels of flowers ; the 
flowers are tubular and curved (as in the 
whole genus,) divided at the end into five 
unequal lobes, about an inch long, and of a 
rich orange-scarlet colour. It is found in the 
woods of Nepal, growing on the branches of 
the trees. The date of its introduction is un- 
known. Flowers from March to July. 

2Eschynanthus,grandijlorus, Lindley (large 
flowered Blushwort). — A shrubby plant, of 
branching habit, with opposite elongated 
lance-shaped leaves, fleshy, and usually toothed 
at the margin, and bearing terminal many- 
flowered umbels of flowers ; the flowers are 
curved and tubular, swollen at the base, and 
with five roundish lobes ; they are about an 
inch and a half long, and of a rich orange red, 
and downy on the outside. It is found in 
Sylhet and in Bengal, and probably in other 
parts of the East Indies, growing on trees. 
Introduced in 1837. Flowers from August 
to December. It is the u&2. 'parasitica ("Wal- 
lich) ; Incarvillea parasitica (Roxburgh ;) 
and Trichosporam grandiflorum (Don). 

JEschynanthus macidatus, Lindley (spotted 
Blushwort). — A branching shrubby plant, 
with opposite lance-shaped, pointed, somewhat 
toothed, fleshy leaves, spotted beneath, and 
bearing terminal umbels of flowers ; the flow- 
ers are large, somewhat pubescent, club 
shaped, with five obtuse nearly equal lobes, 
the tubular part deep scarlet, and the lobes 
yellowish with black streaks. It is found in 
moist shady woods, also on the Khoseea hills, 
at a considerable elevation above the sea. In- 
troduced prior to 1837. Flowers from March 
to July. This sometimes bears the name of 
JE. ramosissima in gardens. 

JEschynanthus purpurascens, Hasskarl 
(purplish green Blushwort). — A straggling 
branched shrubby plant, with opposite oblong 
lance-shaped fleshy leaves, and axillary flowers 
growing several together; the flowers are 
short, tubular, with five rounded lobes, and 
are green, with a conspicuous purple-toothed 
calyx. It is found on Mount Salak, and in 
other parts of Java. Introduced by Messrs. 
Veitch in 1845. Flowers in March and 
April. It has several other names, such as 



JEschynanthus albida (Alph. de Candolle) ; 
Trichosporum albldum (Nees) ; Lysionotus 
albidus (Blume) ; and Bignonia albida 
(Blume). 

JEschynantlius ptidchra, Steudel (beautiful 

Blushwort) A. sub-scandent branching shrub, 

with opposite broadly ovate fleshy leaves, and 
terminal corymbs of large showy blossoms ; 
the flowers are large, tubular, curved, divided 
into five segments, quite smooth, of a rich 
deep scarlet colour,, with dashes of yellow in 
the throat. A native of Java. Introduced 
by Messrs. Veitch in 1845. Flowers in June 
and throughout the summer. It is also called 
Trichosporum pulchrum (Blume). 

yEschynanthns Lobbianus, Hooker (Mr. 
Lobb's Blushwort). — A branching sub-scan- 
dent shrub, with opposite fleshy elliptic leaves, 
and terminal corymbs of beautiful flowers ; 
the latter are tubular curved, downy, of a 
rich scarlet, and divided into four segments, 
the upper one slightly cleft ; they are half 
enclosed in a conspicuous bell-shaped purple 
calyx. It is a native of Java, introduced by 
Messrs. Veitch in 1845. Flowers from June 
to August. 

JEschynanthus miniatus, Lindley (ver- 
milion Blushwort). — A sub-scandent shrubby 
plant, with rooting branches, opposite, acutely 
oval fleshy leaves, and axillary flowers grow- 
ing three together ; the flowers are smaller 
than in the two last, but of the same form 
and colour, and they are hairy, with a shallow 
dish-shaped calyx. It is found in Sincapore, 
and also commonly in Java. Introduced by 
Messrs. Veitch in 1845. Flowers in June 
and throughout the summer. It is apparently 
the same plant as the JE. radicans (TVallich, 
not of Jack) and is probably also the Tri- 
chosporum radicans (Blume) ; it is also the 
JE. Wallichii (Brown). 

JEschynanthus Boschianus, DeVriese. (Van 
den Bosch's Blushwort). — A trailing shrubby 
plant, with rooting branches, opposite ovate 
small fleshy leaves, and axillary clusters of 
blossoms ; the flowers are large, tubular, curved, 
and divided into four segments, the upper one 
two-lobed ; they are of a rich scarlet colour, 
and have a purplish brown calyx. It appears 
to have been introduced to this country from 
the continent in 1844, but its native country 
is uncertain ; it is doubtless an eastern plant. 

JEchynanthus Horsjieldii, Brown (Mr. 
Horsfield's Blushwort). — An erect branching 
shrubby plant, with opposite ovate lance- 
shaped fleshy leaves, and numerous axillary 
blossoms ; the latter are tubular, divided into 
five lobes, and of a light scarlet colour ; they 
are produced very freely. It is a native of 
Java. Introduced in 1843. Flowers from 
June to August. 

JEschynanthus longijlorus, De Candolle 



134 



ON NAMING FLORISTS FLOWERS. 



(long flowered Blushwort). — A sub-erect 
shrubby plant, with spreading and rooting 
branches, opposite oblong lance-shaped leaves, 
nearly entire at the margins, and large band- 
some axillary flowers growing in aggregated 
clusters, each on a separate stalk, placed close 
together and quite erect ; they are upwards 
of two inches long, tubular, slender and 
straight at the base, but larger and also 
curved towards the top ; the colour is a rich 
deep velvety crimson scarlet. It is a native 
of Java, and is found in damp forests 3000 
or 4000 feet above the sea. Introduced by 
Messrs. Veitch in 1845. Flowers in Novem- 
ber, and probably through great part of the 
year. It is also called Lysionotus longiflorus 
(Biume). 

Besides these species of .^Eschynanfhus, 
Messrs. Veitch of Exeter possess at least two 
other kinds, of which we have only seen 
small plants, and these not in a flowering 
condition. These plants appear to be distinct 
at least from all the preceding. One is named 
JEschynanthus zebrina (garden name) ; it has 
opposite lance-shaped pointed leaves, which 
are on the upper surface of a deep green 
colour, marked by paler lines or streaks in 
the position of the embedded veins, the under- 
side is blotched with reddish brown. The 
other is called JEschynantkus atrosanguinea 
(garden name) ; this has opposite ovate lance- 
shaped pointed leaves, which are deep red 
beneath. The latter indicates in its appear- 
ance a near relationship with JE. Lobbianus 
and JE. miniatus ; the former has the ap- 
pearance of the more familiar kinds, such as 
^E. grandiflorus and JE. maculatus. 

ON NAMING FLORISTS' FLOWERS. 

We frequently judge of a man's taste by very 
trifling acts, and sometimes fancy we can take 
the measure of his capacity by the names he 
gives to his flowers. Some men exhibit a 
rare consistency, by taking all the names they 
require from the same source, and selecting 
them with some regard to their applicability 
to the subject itself, as names from the 
Heathen Mythology, or from the Waverly 
Novels, or winning race-horses, or great 
statesmen and their ladies, or commanders of 
renown and their wives ; sometimes, indeed, 
this is carried on so far as to name a flower 
after a lady not in existence, but simply be- 
cause there has been a lord of the name. To 
instance the utter want of taste among some 
men, imagine two persons having raised a 
red flower ; one. calls his Miss Taylor, and 
the other Mars ; now, had there been a Miss 
Taylor with a very red face, and he had de- 
sired to remind the lady and her friends of her 
infirmity, one might have given him credit 
for his common sense, if we had condemned 



his cruelty ; but Miss Taylor, the young lady 
he desired to compliment, was an elegant and 
exceedingly delicate young lady, at home for 
her holidays ; now this man, in such a trifling 
act as that, betrayed sad ignorance and vulgar 
taste, or rather want of taste. It was what 
the world calls a left-handed compliment. The 
one who called his red flower Mars, offended 
no rule of propriety ; and when we see among 
the flowers raised by the same person, the 
name of Diana given to a white flower, and 
Flora given to a beautiful one, Hercules to a 
large and strong one, Cupid to a small one, 
there seems to be some consistency and 
thought about him. But the rage for names 
has rather subsided, in consequence of the great 
check upon the number tolerated; formerly 
there used to be from one to three hundred 
new dahlias a-year, and having answered the 
purpose of the owners, by bringing a price equal 
to the best, and been grown one year, they 
have been heard no more of,. At that time, all 
the sources for names were ransacked ; the 
names of songs, among other sources, supplied 
a number, — the Rose of Yarrow, Poll of Ply- 
mouth, Crazy Jane, Joe the Marine, and many 
others ; the names of wines were resorted to, 
Claret and Burgundy, Constantia and others, 
will be recollected by many. The stars shed 
their influence over the novelties, for we had 
Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Ursa Major, and 
many more. Then there were many botanical 
names, the most stupid of all, because many 
were inapplicable, and the distinctions so 
ridiculously small or unimportant ; thus Rubra 
coerulea, from which we may expect red and 
blue, or a bluish red, was a dirty purple, and 
there were fifty others of the same colour ; 
Picta formosissima was a striped flower, of no 
form at all, whereas its name signified it was 
in that particular superior. If such names 
were adopted in earnest, they should be de- 
scriptive of strong points only ; but it was an 
affectation altogether, to pretend to describe by 
botanical terms characters shared in common 
with scores. Then some of our florists were 
fond of plays and theatres, and one lot would 
be honouring all the dramatists, another would 
be selecting from characters in the plays, while 
a third selected the favourite performers, male 
and female. But of all the sources that were 
resorted to for names, the most improper was 
the Bible. It was a wanton attack upon the 
scruples of many pious Christians ; a perver- 
sion of sacred things. It betrayed a species of 
ignorance not pardonable in the age we live 
in ; a folly, if not a wickedness, without an 
excuse. If it were done in ignorance, it was 
bad ; if in contempt, it was worse. Names are 
in general given to flowers in compliment to 
somebody or something, but what can be the 
motive when taken from the sacred writings? 



NOTES ON FLOWERS.

what excuse can be given for the names of 
Jehu, Cherubim, Og King of Basan, King 
Ahasuerus, and such like? There is nothing to 
recommend them, nothing euphoneous; it seems 
a kind of familiarity net at all creditable, a dis- 
respect openly shown to a book in which millions 
place their hopes of happiness now and here- 
after, and it is to them highly offensive. We 
are not going to open up a theological question, 
for religion is a subject not to be touched upon 
in works like these, except so far as religion 
may be defended anywhere, against any per- 
sons who make horticulture the means of 
offending. We know that in one or two in- 
stances the name has been given thoughtlessly 
by people who meant no harm. We have 
touched upon the subject with a view of put- 
ting a stop to, at the best, a foolish, and, so far 
as example goes, a mischievous act, that may 
grow into a practice. If we put it on no 
worse footing, it is extreme bad taste ; there 
are persons who would not even grow a flower 
under a name at the bare mention of which, 
we are told on the highest authority, every knee 
shall bend. We approve of the taste that 
selects appropriate names from dramas, from 
novels, from histories ; and these are inex- 
haustible. A single play would suggest half 
a score,— Sir Peter Teazle, Lady Teazle, Sir 
Benjamin Backbite, and the rest of the dra- 
matis persona? in the School for Scandal 
Avould last a very lucky man some time, and 
such names are far better than those of popu- 
lar idols. The Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert 
Peel, Lord John Russell, Queen Victoria, 
Prince Albert, and many equally important 
persons and personages, have had their names 
given to twenty things the same season; and it 
is far better that names, not of such temporary 
or such great interest, as the case may be, should 
be taken, as the less likely to be imitated. It 
should also be a sort of principle among 
florists to avoid naming things the same as 
others are already named, or likely to be 
named, and even to make choice of something 
that will afford a series. A steam-boat com- 
pany has set an example worth following ; one, 
with nine or ten boats, names the whole after 
flowers ; we have the Lily, Snowdrop, Pink, 
and so on : then there is a company which 
names all after the stars, such as Venus, 
Mercury, &c. ; another after precious stones, 
Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, Topaz, &c. ; and 
the Iron Steam-boat Company, with their first 
four boats, had Starlight, Daylight, Twilight, 
and Moonlight, and having exhausted the 
lights, began on what some people call the 
dark side of the case, Matrimony, Bachelor, 
Bridesmaid, Wedding Ring. All these fancies 
are well enough, but it is as well to commence 
with something that will supply enough, so 
.that the source should not require changing. 



And while upon the subject of naming flowers, 
we would suggest the propriety of attaching 
to them a brief but unmistakeable description, 
that should stick to it like its name ; in fact, 
one should be identified with the other ; it 
would prevent many mistakes. It would be 
advisable also in Pansies, Tulips, and many 
other flowers, to let the title in every respect 
show what it is; for instance, Bizarres should be 
always masculine names, Roses all feminine, 
and Byblomens all neuter ; in Pansies, the yel- 
low grounds all masculine, the white grounds 
all feminine ; in Picotees, heavy edges all mas- 
culine, and light ones all feminine : something 
of this kind would be generally useful, and 
make us all familiar with the main class from 
the hearing or reading of their names. Taste 
ought to have done this ; but when we con- 
sider the various grades of life from which 
some of the best florists have sprung, and how 
many of the very ignorant and humble classes 
have been concerned in the naming as well as 
the raising of our best flowers, it is not to be 
wondered at. Let us express a hope that these 
few remarks may be of some use among those 
who rarely give themselves the trouble to 
think, for however simple a thing we may 
have to do, there is nothing worth doing that 
is not worth a consideration of what is the 
best way to do it.

Bristle fern.) — Polypodiacese § Hymenophyl- 
leas. — A small fern, almost transparent in 
texture, and one of the most beautiful kinds 
in cultivation. It has a long tomentose, 
creeping stem, from which the fronds grow 
nearly erect, of an ovate outline, membranous 
texture, and two, three, or four times pinna- 
tifid, the ultimate segments being linear 
oblong ; the frond has a kind of crisped or 
curled appearance, and though of a deep green 
is nearly transparent in a fresh state. A very 
widely extended species, occurring in slightly 
varied forms in Jamaica, Martinique, Brazil, 
Mexico, Sandwich Islands, Nepal, and various 
parts of Europe, including England and 
Ireland. It bears many names, of which the 
most common are : — T. scanclens (Hedwig), 
T. diaphanum (Humboldt), T. sjoeciosum 
(Willdenow), T. brevisetum (Brown), T. ala- 
tum (Hooker), T. europceum (Smith), T. pyxi- 
diferum (Hudson), Jfyrnenophyllum alatum 
(Smith),andDidy7nogIoss2imalatum(Des\aux). 
Culture. — Should be kept in a greenhouse, 
covered with a bell glass, and the pot set in a 
pan, frequently but not constantly supplied 
with water ; rough peat soil mixed with free- 
stone and silver sand ; propagated by division 
of the plant.

Cordyline Eu^iphii, Hooker (Rurnphius' 
Cordyline). — Liliaceae § Asparageas. — A 
shrubby plant, with a simple erect stem, two 
or three feet high, bearing foliage at the sum- 
mit ; the leaves are linear, lance-shaped, a 
foot and a half long, and gracefully recurved ; 
the flowers, which are very numerous, and of 
a green and white colour, grow in large ter- 
minal branching panicles. The plant has the 
habit of a Dracaena, or more remotely that of 
a Yucca. A native of Amboyna, and of Java. 
Date of introduction unrecorded. Flowers 
in July. Also called Sansieveira fruticosa 
(Blume). Culture. — Requires a cool stove ; 
peat and loam, and plenty of pot-room ; pro- 
pagated by off-shoots from the plant. (44) 

Exogoniu3I Purga, Beutkam (Purga, or 
true Jalap). — Convolvulaceae § Convolvuleae. 
— A beautiful slender twining plant, produc- 
ing roundish tubers, which become as large as 
a moderate-sized turnip, and give rise to 
numerous rootlets and stems ; the leaves are 
rather small, cordate, very much acuminated, 
so as to approach arrow-shaped ; the flowers 
grow from the axils, usually two or three 
together, rarely singly ; they are of a purplish 
red colour, between funnel and salver-shaped ; 
that is, they have a long slender tube, and an 
expanded limb about two and a half inches 
across. A native of the high mountains of

HO 



THE APHIS YASTATOR. 




THE APHIS VASTATOR, 



This species of the family of insects, com- 
monly known by the name of " Green-fly," is 
determined by Mr. Smee, in his recent work 
on' the Potato Plant,* as the cause of the 
malady which has affected the crops of that 
vegetable ; and his opinion has not been hastily 
formed, but has evidently been the result of 
careful, extensive, and original investigation. 
We cannot, indeed, fully coincide in Mr. Smee's 
views ; although in the absence of any positive 
and certain explanation of this really import- 
ant question, the insect theory, supported as it 
is by such an amount of circumstantial evi- 
dence as this gentleman has recorded, may 
fairly lay claim to as much consideration as any 
other that has been broached. 

TVe glean the following particulars of the 
aphis from Mr. Smee's book : — 

* "The Potato Plant: its Uses and Properties: 
together with the Cause of the Present Malady. The 
Extension of that Disease to other Plants, the Question 
of Famine arising therefrom, and the Best Means of 
Averting that Calamity." By Alfred Smee, F.R.S., 
Surgeon to the Bank of England, to the Eoyal General 
Dispensary, to the Central London Ophthalmic Institu- 
tion, and Lecturer on Surgery at the Aldersgate School 
of Medicine. Illustrated with ten Lithographs. Lon- 
don : Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, Pater- 
noster-row. 



The Aphis vastator, when full grown, is 
about the tenth of an inch long. In very early life 
its body is nearly transparent ; later, it is of an 
olive colour ; at other times it is grass green ; 
and at a later period may be found of a reddish 
colour. It is found in three stages of exist- 
ence — the larva, the pupa, and the imago, or 
perfect-winged insect, in all of which states it 
feeds, remains active, and probably multiplies. 
The antennae, or horns, are seven -jointed, 
nearly as long as the body, and sometimes 
even longer. When the creature is at rest, 
and feeding quietly, these lie reflexed over his 
back ; but when he is roving about they are 
extended before him. The rostrum, or pro- 
boscis, is about one-fourth as long as the body, 
and contains a fine apparatus for piercing 
plants : this instrument, when open, presents 
three diverging delicate piercers, or lancets, 
one of which answers to the tongue, and the 
others to the jaws of insects. The head 
has fine spines upon it. The eyes are red or 
black, and so strongly coloured that they may 
be seen through the membrane which en- 
velopes the insect before it is born. The ab- 
domen is very angular, and is furnished 
towards the extremity with two tubercles, 
which extend posteriorly as far as the apex

of the abdomen, and are hollow, containing a 
peculiar matter in the interior.* The winged 
insect has four wings, with which it is capable 
of flying great distances ; but in its final state 
it.is usually a lazy creature, and not very prone 
to fly far. The insects feed by thrusting their 
suctorial apparatus into the cellular tissue of 
the leaf of such plants as they attack. 

Curtis first named this insect the Aphis 
rapce, from its having been found to attack the 
turnip. This name Mr. Smee apologizes to 
entomologists for having changed to A. vastator, 
the destroyer, because, as he states, it feeds 
upon the turnip in common with other aphides, 
itself too attacking twenty or thirty different 
plants. 

Mr. Smee thus states the connexion between 
the insect and the disease : — The aphis vas- 
tator comes upon the potato plant in a winged 
state, and there brings forth its young alive. 
These generally prefer a large and rather de- 
bilitated leaf. After a short time the insect 
brings forth other young, which young them- 
selves reproduce without any connexion with 
the other sex ; and thus from a single speci- 
men a plant may be speedily covered with the 
insects. It has been proved by Reaumur that 
in five generations one aphis may be the pro- 
genitor of 5,904,900,000 descendants ; and it 
is supposed that in one year there may be 
twenty generations. I know no reason why 
the vastator should be less prolific than its 
congeners. The vastator begins at the larger 
leaves of the plant, which, after a short time, 
becoming injured by the abstraction of sap, die 
either partially or entirely. This is not going 
on in one plant alone ; it is generally progres- 
sing in every plant in the field at the same 
time, leaf by leaf all dying. Regarding the 
mode in which a whole field becomes attacked 
I may observe that the vastator is a sad rover. 
When the creature first appears he is to be found 
sparingly distributed over the larger leaves 
of the plant ; but when the greater part of the 
plant is destroyed, and the insect has multi- 
plied, great numbers may be found on a single 
leaf: they then become partially starved, enter 
into the pupa state, cast their skins, and 
emerge as winged insects, when they fly away 
and leave no trace behind them, save and ex- 
cept the destruction of the plant, and some few 
specimens which have been injured by ichneu- 
mons. This fact is exceedingly remarkable, 
for on watching a piece of land, I have found 
scarcely one of the insects to be left behind, 
the greater part having had their wings de- 
veloped, and flown away. I think that from 
the period of birth, it requires about a fort- 
night before the aphis obtains wings and flies

these organs. — M. 



away. "When the vastator attacks the potato 
each leaf is separately destroyed, and the mis- 
chief may extend to the stalk and the root. 
The effect may be watched upon a sprig of potato 
placed in water. When the insect has damaged 
the leaf of the plant it is much influenced by 
wet weather ; a shower of rain will fill the 
stems with water ; and in consequence of the 
solid portionf having been taken away by the 
insect, the moisture cannot cause the rapid 
growth of the plant which should take place 
under such circumstances. The sap being thus 
in too fluid a condition acts prejudicially, and 
the plant rots at the collar, the under-ground 
stems, various parts of the upper stem, the 
leaves, the fruit. Sometimes when the plant 
is freed from its pest, it will send forth new 
roots to nourish the stem, and the haulm will 
thus retain much of its vigour. If, however, the 
plant has been once seriously damaged, it will 
perish without a second attack of the aphis. 
It is remarkable that even those tubers of 
diseased plants which appear sound in the 
first instance are very apt to become diseased 
upon keeping. Thus we may infer that every 
part of a diseased plant is diseased. As a 
consequence of the individuality of a plant 
being preserved and propagated from parent 
to offspring, a plant originally diseased will 
continue its disease in any new growth which 
originates from it; and thus it is impossible 
to tell for how long the disease may continue 
to show itself in the progeny of a plant once 
infected. The probability is that in time, if 
the original cause should not continue to act, 
the malady would be gradually annihilated. 

Such is an outline, .necessarily brief, of the 
connexion Mr. Smee traces between the aphides 
and the disease. The chief objection that has 
been raised against this view takes the broad 
ground that aphides cannot destroy healthy 
vegetation. This is, however, an untenable 
position. Gardeners, indeed, too well know 
the powers of these insects as regards their 
destructiveness of vegetables ; and which they 
appear to effect in the manner pointed out by 
Mr. Smee. It may be interesting to show how 
far this opinion is opposed to general evidence. 
To notice individual cases : — the hop-plant is 
seriously damaged by an aphis, sometimes so 
much so as to destroy the crop, and the season's 
growth. The field-bean is attacked and 
destroyed in a similar way by an aphis. 
Geraniums and other greenhouse plants suffer 
irreparable injury from the attacks of an aphis. 
The young shoots of fruit trees are destroyed 
by aphides. The recorded opinions on this 
subject are explicit: we may quote a few ex- 
amples : — MTntosh, after noticing their extra-

ordinary fecundity, observes,* " Such being 
their powers of propagation, and the voracity 
with which they attack the respective plants 
they feed upon (and few there be that are ex- 
empt from them), if they had not natural 
enemies to subdue them, all the efforts of man 
would be unavailing, and they would soon pro- 
duce universal desolation." Curtis remarks, f 
" The mischief that follows from the presence 
of the aphides arises from their thrusting a 
hollow proboscis into the leaf or stalk of a 
plant, through which they imbibe the juices, 
thus supporting themselves at the expense of 
the plant ; and by thus draining it of its due 
nourishment it soon becomes exhausted, droops, 
and often dies, when the number of the aphides 
is very great." In another place we find it 
stated t that " were they not eagerly sought 
for by many other creatures, they would be- 
come more destructive to- the whole vegetable 
creation than any other race of insects what- 
ever." Again we read,§ that " many species 



of aphis commit most destructive depredations. 
During the summer of 1833 the cabbage and 
turnip crops in Kent were much injured and 
often destroyed by countless swarms of A. 
brassicoe" Loudon speaks of them || as being 
most " universal depredators of vegetables." 
This is evidence enough of the power of these 
insects over vegetable life ; and the main diffi- 
culty in accepting Mr. Smee's theory is, that 
there should result from the attacks of the 
insect, a tainted existence, instead of entire 
destruction, in the case of such as were at- 
tacked. This seems in some degree to favour 
the views of those who consider that thj con- 
stitution of the plant is impaired by high cul- 
tivation. Probably a combination of the causes 
which have been assigned furnish a better ex- 
planation of the origin of the disease than 
either of them separately. In fact, it is not 
difficult to believe that a weakened constitution 
in the plant, resulting from excessive, high, 
(not lengthened) cultivation — that mode of 



6 

t 3 




cultivation, too, somewhat unnatural — accom- 
panied by a morbid condition of the atmosphere, 
the latter condition also favouring the pro- 
duction, and aiding the attacks, of parasitical 
insects and fungi, would produce such a result 
as we have witnessed in the case of the potato. 
We are, nevertheless, aware that there are facts 
which viewed singly have a bearing against 
every one of these assumed causes. 

It is also fair to state, that by those persons 
in this country who have chiefly supported the 
insect theoiy, very different kinds of insects 
have been pointed out as the cause ; and we 
believe Mr. Smee was the first who charged 
the mischief to an aphis.

and winged (3) state, all considerably magni- 
fied. The detailed figures** here introduced

As to remedies, Mr. Smee sums up what he 
proposes as follows : — 

The best means of destroying the cause is 
to pick off the insect when we desire to pro- 
tect a single plant. To pull off affected leaves, 
or to sprinkle them with quicklime, when we 
wish to protect a larger number of plants. We 
should endeavour to get our produce ripe at

an early period by using early kinds, and by 
planting early, perhaps even in autumn. We 
should protect ladybirds, ichneumons, and soft- 
billed birds, which feed upon them, and we may 
try the effect of ducks to gobble up the parasite. 
Mr. Smee treats his subject throughout in 
a comprehensive way, or, as he himself ex- 
presses it, he was induced to " consider all the 
assumed causes of the malady ;" and with this 
view we have chapters on the relation of the 
disease to internal causes, to external causes, to 
soils and manures, to fungi, to animal parasites; 
the disease in other plants; theory of the disease; 
f ut ure prospects ; artificial and n atural remedies, 
and on various other matters. The whole is 
handled in a thoroughly circumstantial and 
business-like way ; and whatever may come of 
Mr. Smee's assumed discovery of the cause of 
the disease, he has provided an instructive and 
entertaining volume, not the least commend- 
able feature of which consists in its originality. 
It is illustrated by several good lithographs. 



MANAGEMENT OF TREES ; 

THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY MAY 
BE MOST BENEFICIALLY PLANTED.* 

The Oak delights in a strong deep loam ; 
will flourish in clay land, with a small pro- 
portion of surface loam ; very soon becomes 
bush-headed where there is a thin soil resting 
upon gravel or chalk ; cannot endure marshy 
ground, and should not be planted in very 
high elevations : there are many ornamental 
kinds, the most useful are the two indigenous 
varieties, the sessile-fruited and the stalk- 
fruited, respecting the good properties of 
which practical men are divided in opinion. 

The Ash delights in a sheltered situation, 
and good rich soil ; is not fond of gravel ; 
should never be planted in hedge-rows, as it 
will mat the ground to a considerable distance 
with its roots; makes good copsewood ; is 
always the better and tougher the faster it is 
grown ; its use for many agricultural and 
gardening purposes is well known ; makes 
excellent fire-wood, however wet. 

The Elm. — The two most important vari- 
eties are the narrow-leaved or English, and 
the Scotch ; the former requires a good soil 
and warm situation ; does not flourish in 
Scotland ; grows rapidly, and attains a great 
height. The Scotch is the most useful sort ; 
has smooth bai"k, and will grow in the most 
unfavourable soils, and very exposed situa- 
tions ; when cut up, does not long survive 
alternations of dryness and moisture. 

* From the " United Gardeners' and Land Stew- 
ards' Journal." 



The Beech delights in a chalky soil ; has 
a fine effect as a detached tree ; should not be 
grown in copsewoods, as scarcely any under- 
wood will flourish beneath it : the wood is of 
little use for open-air purposes, but stands 
uninjured a long time when kept constantly 
under water. 

The Sycamore flourishes in very poor soils, 
and in exposed and lofty situations ; can stand 
a dash of the sea spray with little injury ; 
grows very fast; is useful as a nurse to more 
valuable timber; was much used at one time 
for domestic utensils. 

The Birch is chiefly valuable as a nurse- 
wood, as fuel, and for common purposes ; will 
flourish in almost any soil, and in the coldest 
bleakest situation ; is very desirable for garden 
purposes, as supplying us with the best 
besoms ; is interesting on account of the fra- 
grance of its leaves,, and the whiteness of its 
bark, the latter property having often stirred 
up conscience-stricken alarms in the heart of 
the benighted wight, when stories of ghosts 
and spirits in white, as well as black, were 
more rife than now. 

The Scotch Laburnum, especially the broad- 
leaved, is valuable for cabinet-making ; obtains 
the best colour when grown on light sandy 
soils ; will grow in any situation ; has a fine 
effect on the borders of a wood skirting the 
high road, when in bloom ; is greatly prized 
by hares and rabbits ; is sometimes sown thickly 
as underwood, in plantations, for the purpose 
of saving other trees from these open enemies 
to the planter. 

The Mountain Ash is valuable for its hardi- 
ness, as it will grow in any soil, wet or dry ; 
forms a good nurse, as it grows very fast 
when young ; is useful as timber for many 
purposes, though there is not often much of 
it ; is beautiful both in flower and fruit, and 
was considered a most valuable exorcist in 
the hey-day of witchcraft, a piece of rowan 
tree and a ball of worsted constituting a greater 
bugbear to the broomstick sisterhood than the 
reversing of an old horse-shoe on the byre or 
stable door. 

The Wild Cherry is very ornamental ; is 
valuable for cabinet-making, and requires a 
dry soil ; beware of planting it near villages 
or hamlets, unless you can command the equa- 
nimity of mind to be careless at the sight of 
boys, as well as birds, perched upon the 
branches in search of the fruit. 

The Horse Chestnut requires a good loamy 
soil, and a sheltered situation ; is beautiful in 
its outline, and splendid when in bloom ; 
grows quickly, but the timber is useful for 
little else than firewood. 

The Alder and the Willow are useful for 
marshy ground, and the sides of streams, 
where the latter is always an interesting 



144 



WINTER FLOWERING PELARGONIUMS. 



object ; the wood is comparatively of little 
value. 

The Lime and the Poplar, in all their 
vai'ieties, require good soil to grow them to 
advantage, and then, notwithstanding their 
quick growth, and the many uses to which 
the wood may be applied, they should not be 
much planted where ultimate profit, rather 
than immediate effect, is the object aimed at. 

Of resinous trees, the Scotch Pine may be 
first mentioned, as it will flourish in higher 
latitudes, more exposed situations, and poorer 
soil than any other of the resinous family ; 
as, like the larch and the spruce, its roots 
keep. near the surface, instead of descending 
to a great depth like the oak : trenching for 
its culture is almost a needless operation, 
unless where a very quick growth is required. 
In good loamy soils it will grow fast as a 
nurse plant, but in such circumstances its 
wood is soft and little worth ; when grown 
in elevated situations, and poor sandy, or 
gravelly soils, its timber is valuable and en- 
during. 

The Cluster Pine, the Stone Pine, and 
many others, though interesting as affording 
variety, have not yet been found equal in 
quality to the older sorts. 

The Spruce Fir presents its chief claims to 
our attention from its being a beautiful ever- 
green, growing generally, whether singly or 
in masses, as straight as a regular cone ; be- 
coming thus fitted for all sorts of poles, the 
youngest trees being, so far as their size is 
concerned, as durable as old ones ; making a 
good nurse plant from the warmth produced 
by its evergreen character ; growing freely 
on all soils, from those that are low and wet, 
to those that are high and dry, but presenting 
the drawback that, for general purposes, its 
wood is far inferior to the Scotch pine and 
the larch. 

The Larch is one of our most valuable 
timber trees, whether we consider its adapta- 
tion to all soils and situations, except a wet 
one, the rapidity of its growth, its admirable 
qualities as a nurse for the oak, &c, and the 
usefulness and enduring qualities of its timber, 
from the time it is fit for a rake handle, to the 
time it is cut up into boards and planking. In 
good deep loamy soils, it should only be used 
as a nurse, as the rapidity of its growth will 
deteriorate the timber if it does not render it 
hollow-hearted. The sides of mountains are 
its favourite sites, and poor scraggy land is to 
be chosen in preference to that which is richer ; 
it is one of the best improvers of poor land, 
from the droppings of leaves, as may easily be 
seen in the vigour and luxuriance with which 
the grasses grow, after the trees have received 
their different thinnings. Even on this ac- 
count it is valuable for covers for game, though 



it would be hard to make gamekeepers believe 
so, who prefer spruce, furze, and hazel, beneath 
which little will grow. 

The Hazel is a valuable shrub for under- 
wood and copsewood, especially where a hazelly 
loam preponderates ; when cut every eight or 
ten years, it furnishes abundance of shoots 
for crate and basket ware, &c, and in favour- 
able seasons, the nuts might be worth collect- 
ing ; where, however, squirrels and boys con- 
gregate in the neighbourhood, it is better to 
make no calculation of revenue from this latter 
source. Sir "Walter Scott was truly enthusi- 
astic in his care of his plantations, but he 
found it no loss to admit the public to the 
greatest part of his demesne ; and a fine sight 
it must have been to behold the younkers 
meeting the laird to show him the nuts in 
their pinafores, vastly proud if from any of 
them he would condescend to accept a hand- 
ful. Well did the baronet know that neither 
his trees nor hazels would suffer when every 
urchin was thus put upon his good behaviour. 
Notwithstanding all that has been said to the 
contrary, there is, in*%eneral, in the heart of 
a Britisher, that which causes him to look 
with an eye of conservatism upon objects when 
an appeal is thus openly made to his sense of 
right, integrity, and honour. 

WINTER FLOWERING PELARGONIUMS. 

To produce flowers of the Pelargonium 
during winter and early spring, the following 
treatment is recommended : — When the plants 
have done flowering, they are headed down, 
at different times, to secure a succession of 
bloom the next season. "When the plants 
have produced young shoots an inch long, the 
soil should be shaken from the roots, and 
they should be re-potted into their flowering- 
pots, the size of which will depend on the 
size of the plants, but should be as small as 
the roots can be got into without crowding. 
The young shoots should not be topped. By 
this treatment they will usually be knotted 
for bloom by the end of November, when 
they may be taken, in succession, into the 
flower-forcing house, or other structure where 
a genial warmth is kept up. There is no 
advantage in placing them in heat before the 
blooming buds are formed ; on the contrary, 
this is often the cause of failure. If pro- 
perly managed, the pelargonium will bear 
much more heat than is usually supposed. 
The following sorts are very suitable for early 
forcing : — Gauntlet, Grace Darling, Alba 
multiflora, Admiral Napier, General Wash- 
ington, Bella. These may be succeeded later 
in the season by — Duke of Cornwall, Una, 
Sultana, Victory, Luna, and Coronation ; but 
the latter sorts must not be placed in heat 
until they are well advanced.

Plant and Transplant from nearly all of the 
above ; also artichokes, chamomile, chives, 
fennel, garlic, potatoes, rosemary, scurvy- 
grass, tansy, tarragon, water-cress, and worm- 
wood. 

General Directions. — The ground should 
be well pulverized, and thoroughly prepared 
for the reception of the seeds ; the well work- 
ing of the soil is equal to a good manuring ; 
avoid working the soil when wet. Take an 
early opportunity to ridge and furrow part 
of the garden ; in doing this form ridges to run 
east and west, and from the top allow them 
to form a slope down on each side for eight 
or ten feet or more ; on the south aspect plant 
the early crops, and on the north such as 
spinach or lettuce : this will prevent these 
crops from running to seed, and other conve- 
niences attend the practice ; it also secures 
more space for cropping by increasing the 
48. 



surface. Alterations of all kinds must now 
be finished ; and sowing, pricking, and plant- 
ing out must be constantly attended to, pre- 
ferring dry weather for the former, and 
showery weather for the latter operations. 
Clear and prepare the ground for receiving 
new crops, and make it a rule that every part 
of the garden be occupied in regular rotation. 
Keep the hoe going unremittingly, thus suf- 
fering no weeds to grow, and at the same 
time opening the soil to atmospheric in- 
fluence. 

Artichokes {Globe). — The young plants 
raised from seed may now be planted out ; 
young plants can also be obtained from the 
suckers of the old ones, and the sooner the 
better. 

Artichokes (Jerusalem). — If not planted 
let it be done immediately ; frequent hoeings, 
and the removing of the weak shoots will 
assist them. 

Asparagus. — Sow, if not already done. The 
seedling plants of last year are proper fur 
planting in pits or such places, where they 
may be forced without removal. In cutting 
for use, bear in mind that it is superfluous to 
cut much below the surface, the white part 
not being eatable. 

Anise. — Partially thin out the early sowing, 
and stir the soil slightly". 

Basil. — Transplant at the end of the month 
into a warm rich border, keeping the plants 
six inches apart ; gently water them ; keep 
some plants in boxes or frames, to come in 
early. 

Beans. — Stir and draw up the earth about 



146

those above the surface ; plant again at the 
end of the month. 

Beet. — If the seed has not come up well, 
sow again, aud more thickly ; grow a con- 
siderable quantity, as the roots will prove 
valuable. 

Borecole. — Plant every spai*e corner as 
soon as the plants are large enough for re- 
moval ; it is not requisite to prick these out ; 
lose no time in sowing, if not done. 

Brussels Sp)'Outs. — The plants preserved 
for seed will require water ; prick out those 
sown last month, and sow again at once. 

Brocoli. — Prick out those sown early, into 
rich soil, when they have developed the third 
leaf. Make principal sowings this month, in 
a good situation, and protect the seeds from 
birds, by placing netting or branches over the 
seed beds. 

Cabbages. — Sow a few more, and plant out ir 
every vacant space ; hoe and earth up the early 
crops ; if the soil is poor, it can be enriched 
easily and beneficially with liquid manure, 
taking care to give it at the roots only, and 
in a weak state at first ; this applies equally 
to the early, late, and red sorts. 

Cardoons. — Sow at the end of the month 
in a loamy sandy soil, without fresh manure ; 
sow where they are to remain, as they do not 
transplant very well. 

Carrots. — G-ood crops are often produced 
from seed sown at the end of this month, but 
the middle, or early in the month is better, 
if the weather permits ; hoe and thin those 
sown for early use to three or four inches 
asunder ; thin the main crops to six inches 
apart : they should be thinned early. 

Caraway. — Sow early in the month, on any 
common soil ; it is a biennial. 

Cauliflower. — Plant out the whole of the 
wintered plants on a warm rich border, two 
and a half feet apart ,• draw a little earth to 
those put out last month, and if cutting winds 
prevail, small spruce fir-branches stuck on the 
exposed side will shelter them ; raise the 
hand-lights on bricks. Prick out those sown 
last month, and shade them a little. "Water 
the whole according to the state of the 
weather. 

Celery. — Sow early for the main crop, in a 
warm spot, in rich mellow soil ; if the weather 
is cold, put a frame or merely a light over the 
ground. Prick out those sown last month, 
three or four inches apart ; water them, and 
if warm they will require shading afterwards 
for a little. Expose fully those which are 
established. 

Celeriac. — Sow immediately in a light rich 
soil, and thin out when two inches high, to 
be afterwards transplanted. 

Chamomile. — Plant slips now, either with 
or without roots ; water and shade, if dry ; 



the poorer the soil the more flowers are pro- 
duced. 

Chervil. — If much wanted, sow again, as it 
runs quickly to seed, and the younger it is 
the better. 

Chives. — Increase by division ; they are 
cut close to the ground when used, and are 
esteemed both in soups and salads. 

Coriander. — Sow in an open situation : 
the seeds are much used in confectionary, and 
have a carminative and stomachic property ; 
thin the plants to a foot apart, if on rich soil. 

Cumin. — Thin out to six inches ; it may 
yet be sown on a warm spot ; some use the 
seeds in bread. 

Cress. — Sow twice or oftener this month, 
and secure quick growth by shelter if requi- 
site. It is a good rule to sow again when the 
former sowing is breaking through the surface. 

Bill. — Thin the plants to a few inches 
apart ; the seeds are medicinal, and also used 
in pickles. 

Fennel. — If the soil about the old plants 
has been undisturbed it will probably be 
covered with seedling plants, a few of which 
may be transplanted at ten inches apart. 

Finochio. — Sow the first week in an open 
situation, in a light moist and rich soil, in deep 
drills ; it is not transplanted, but thinned in 
the drill to eight inches or so, and a little soil 
laid up around each plant. 

Garlic. — Keep the plants clear of weeds, and 
do not suffer their growth to be disturbed. The 
soil should be cleared from the base of the stems. 

Kidney Beans. — Xext month will do to 
plant these ; in the mean time prepare the 
ground thoroughly by working it well ; a 
light, rich, and dry soil is suitable. Sow a 
boxfull thickly now, slightly cover them and 
set them in heat ; these can be planted out by 
the middle of May. 

Leehs are ready to plant out when from 
six to ten inches high. Choose a deep and 
rich soil for them, or make it so if not 
already ; when planted they do not require to 
be firmed, only allow a little soil to fall into 
the hole with the plants, and leave them. 
Plant in drills fifteen inches apart, and ten 
inches in the row. Sow a secondary crop for 
a late supply. 

Lettuces. — Sow every three weeks now, 
and make two plantings from each sowing ; 
plant them a foot apart in a warm rich sandy 
soil. 

Love Apples. — Pot off those sown last month 
into six-inch pots, two in a pot, and keep 
under glass until the middle of May. 

Marjoram. — Thin and transplant, say to 
ten inches apart ; it may still be sown on a 
warm border. 

Marygold. — Sow in the first week in any 
light soil, and thin out to ten inches apart ;

this is esteemed by many for culinary pur- 
pose*. 

Nasturtium (Indian Cress). — Sow any 
time this month, either in drills or patches, in 
almost any soil. They can be made useful as 
a screen, placing stakes for them to climb over. 
Onions. — Hoe when they are above ground ; 
they may yet be sown with success ; either roll 
or trample in the seed. Now is a good time to 
sow for pickling ; any sort will do ; sow by 
the side of a wall, and the thicker the better ; 
they must not be thinned. Transplant the 
autumn-sown crops. 

Parsley. — Thin out to six inches apart ; 
it may be transplanted, and if the crop is 
scanty so increased ; the most curled plants 
should be selected. 

Parsnips must be thinned to ten or twelve 
inches apart ; keep the soil stirred among 
them. 

Peas. — For late crops, the marrows, the 
blue Prussian, and Auvergne are well adapted ; 
as a general rule, the best time to sow the 
succession- crops is when the others are just 
through the ground. Top all the sorts when 
one foot high, and again when three feet or 
so ; attend to staking in time, adapting the 
length of the stakes to the sorts. If dry 
weather prevails give thorough waterings, 
and put a little of the nitrate of soda in the 
water — about half an ounce to a gallon of 
water. 

Potatoes may still be planted ; avoid cut- 
ting the sets and planting them deep ; do not 
use rank manure. Hoe and keep the soil 
open among advancing crops, and give them 
space. Seedlings may be raised, either with 
or without heat ; many plants may be gathered 
where the last year's haulm was left to rot ; 
plant them at the usual distance ; though 
large potatoes are not got the first year, an 
excellent crop of new sorts will be had the 
second. 

Purslane. — Sow now if not done last month ; 
thin out to six inches apart. 

Radishes. — Sow again this month ; monthly 
sowings will be sufficient if the place is moist 
where they are grown. 

Rampion. — This being chiefly valuable in 
winter, the sowing may be deferred until 
August ; clear the ground where it has been 
growing, as soon as it is disused. 

Rhubarb. — A rich soil is indispensable for 
this crop ; seed may now be sown with suc- 
cess ; the stalks are ready for use when the 
leaves are half expanded. 

Rosemary may be raised from seed, but 
it strikes readily from slips, inserted in sandy 
soil now. 

Sage will strike readily now from cuttings; 
choose the young slips ; it is also increased 
with facility by layers. 



Savory. — The main sowing may be made 
by the middle of the month, upon a light 
warm border. 

Savoys. — Sow the principal crop about the 
middle of the month ; plant out a few at the 
end of the month ; if ground is scarce, they 
may be planted between beans or even early 
cauliflowers, but an open rich spot is pre- 
ferable. 

Salsify and Scorzonera. — The main sowing 
may be made the first week, or towards the 
middle of the month ; if they come up in 
clusters, thin them early; sow shallow and in 
drills, about a foot or fifteen inches apart. 

Sea-liale may be raised from seed, which is 
preferable to slips or pieces of the root ; sow 
rather thin, and cover about two inches ; as 
soon as up, thin to a few inches apart ; if the 
young plants are properly attended to, and 
watered with liquid manure, they will do to 
force next season. 

Scurvy Grass. — Sow or divide the roots 
now, and give it a light and moist soil. 

Skirret. — Sow in the second week, in 
shallow drills a foot apart. 

Spinach, at this season of the year, is 
often sown between the rows of peas, and the 
coolness of this situation is in its favour. 
Still, if ground can be got, this and all crops 
are better grown by themselves. Thin to 
four or six inches, and sow monthly. 

Tansy is easily raised either from seeds or 
by division of the roots ; any common soil 
suits it, and a few plants will probably meet 
the demand. 

Tarragon. — Divide the roots, and make 
the most of it, as it is frequently required for 
forcing. It is easily struck by cuttings in the 
summer months. 

Turnips. — Sow again early ; thin by the 
hoe to five inches apart as soon as they have 
formed their rough leaves. At the appear- 
ance of fly sprinkle the whole with soot, lime, 
or wood ashes ; shelter them a little by laying 
a few branches over them when brairding. 

Vegetable Marrow. — Sow in a frame or 
under a hand-glass about the 20th, and at 
the appearance of the rough leaf pot them as 
cucumbers, and treat similarly. 

Water Cress. — This most popular of salads 
may be simply grown either in streams or 
pools, or without either, thus: — form four feet 
beds of strong loam, 'in a moist situation, 
plant about six inches apart, and keep in a 
moist state in summer by watering, and suc- 
cess is certain. Irrigation is commendably 
resorted to, where quantities are grown. 

Winter or Normandy Cress. — Sow in a 
light rich soil, and thin out to three inches. 

Wormwood. — Propagate by slips put in a 
sandy soil; and plant out in a rich earth ; a 
few plants will now meet the demand.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL. 



THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Disbudding, thinning 
the fruit and blossoms, protecting, grafting ; 
and also cutting down and grafting the inferior 
sorts ; hoeing, and gathering, or destroying 
of caterpillars, must all be attended to, and 
will form the leading features of management 
during this month. 

Almonds. — Protection may still be required 
in a few situations; the quantity of fruit and 
the shoots left should be adjusted according 
to the state of the trees. 

Apples. — In exposed places protect the 
blossom of the finer sorts. Look sharply for 
insects ; wash with soft soap and warm water 
those infested, or likely to be so, with the 
American blight ; for the green fly syringe 
with tobacco water ; for caterpillars resort to 
hand picking, dredging with the powder of 
white hellebore, or syringing with a decoction 
of its roots ; do the whole promptly, and per- 
severe until the means are found effectual. 

Apricots. — Again disbud and thin, both 
the shoots and fruit ; it may be necessary to 
unnail where any branches or fruit are 
cramped; two fruits to every square foot is a 
fair crop for a healthful tree. 

Cherries. — The green fly must be arrested 
early by fumigating or syringing, and dusting 
the leaves when wet witli Scotch snuff; thin 
the shoots and fruit moderately. 

Currants. — In addition to the other modes 
of killing the aphides, syringing with soot 
and lime-water is a good method ; have the 
ground neatly hoed among the trees, and if 
near the border also raked. 

Figs. — Lose not a moment if these are not 
nailed ; those shoots which are most forward, 
may be thinned moderately. 

Gooseberries. — Have the ground neatly hoed ; 
the caterpillar must be scrupulously watched ; 
in addition to the other remedies may be men- 
tioned that of dusting the powder of white 
hellebore root on the foliage when wet, or 
syringing with a decoction of the same. 

Filberts. — Keep thoroughly clean, and rub 
off a few of the misplaced early shoots. 

Mulberries. — From their lateness in pro- 
ducing foliage, they may still be transplanted; 
choose a spot where they will be surrounded 
with green velvety turf, on which, if the 
fruit falls, it will sustain no injury. They 
are also ornamental trees. 

Nectarines. — Proceed with the gradual 
thinning of wood and blossoms, and, at the 
end of the month, of the fruit also ; two 
fruits to a square foot is a fair crop, for a 
tree in ordinary vigour ; allow more if the 
tree is luxuriant, and less if sickly. 

Peaches. — The coverings of most wall 
trees may be taken off at the end of the 



month, but this depends on the weather, and 
state of the trees ; disbud and thin the super- 
abundant crop. A slight fire may be desi- 
rable where flued walls are at command, and 
if so, keep on the external cover. Mulching 
transplanted trees may also be requisite, if 
the weather is dry and searching winds pre- 
vail ; syringe in the morning, when the fruit 
is set, with clear soot and tobacco water. 

Pears. — The protecting of the early blos- 
soms of the fine sorts in severe weather may 
still be attended to ; and as pears have often 
bad roots, those trees lately planted may be 
watered and mulched with advantage. All 
foreright and redundant shoots must be rubbed 
off at their first appearance; and so also with 
an overcrop of fruit. 

Plums. — Crops are often lost from an over 
abundant blossom being allowed to expand ; 
the remedy of duly thinning may be yet par- 
tially applied with effect ; make provision to 
lay in young wood. 

Raspberries. — Hoe deeply amongst them ; 
some of the early suckers may be removed. 

Strawberries. — Have these thoroughly 
cleaned before the runners begin to spread ; 
but where a stock of young plants is not 
required, it is better not to allow runners to 
remain ; water if dry, also mulch. 

Vines. — Little can be done here ; a syring- 
ing might be given in the mornings, to assist 
the breaking of the buds; defer the thinning 
until next month. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — With the advancing 
season, increased and unceasing vigilance is 
necessary. The same principles which en- 
sured success early, will do the same later in 
the season, with this difference, that the arti- 
ficial means of attaining certain ends are sup- 
planted by natural ones, which are more sure 
and simple. The progress of vegetation and 
increase of evaporation will render additional 
waterings necessary ; and the sap which is 
now circulating rapidly, and finding new 
channels, will have to be conducted, without 
waste, to the perfecting of the fruit, and 
building up of the plant, by pruning and 
regulating ; no small skill and attention is 
necessary to maintain this in free and con- 
stant play, allowing at no time any cause to 
come into operation to produce either a 
stagnancy, or an over luxuriance. Avoid 
extremes of cold, heat, or food-giving, and all 
sudden variations. 

Asparagus. — Temperature, 60 to 65 degrees 
by day, and 55 degrees at night. Use every 
shoot, and if the bed is in a good state, no 
additional one is necessary. 

Cherries. — Temperature, from 55 to 70 
degrees by day, and 50 to 55 degrees at 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL

night. Syringe gently every morning ; re- 
move all foreright and crude shoots ; tie in 
neatly those which remain, it' the trees are 
trained : moisture must be gradually with- 
held, as soon as they begin to colour, and 
more air must then be given. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature, 75 to 85 de- 
grees by day, and 60 to 70 degrees at night. 
Syringe those in stoves daily ; those in pits 
and frames not so often, and always in the 
mornings ; look over all every. day, and stop 
and thin ; reserve and impregnate one or two 
good fruits for seed ; attend to early shutting 
up; pot off those for out-door ridges, and sow 
a few more, 

Figs. — Temperature, 65 to 70 degrees by 
d/iy, and 55 to 60 degrees at night. Con- 
tinue to disbud ; top the young shoots at 
about six inches long ; maintain a very moist 
atmosphere; any which show signs of ripen- 
ing their fruit might be removed to the stove ; 
withholding water partially at the roots will 
partly answer the same end. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature, 70 to 75 
degrees by day, and 60 degrees at night. 
Maintain a moist atmosphere, and syringe 
daily ; water twice a week with clear liquid 
manure ; cease sowing this month for forcing ; 
air freely. 

Melons. — Temperature, 80 degrees by day, 
70 degrees by night. Look over the plants 
nearly every day, and watch the flowei's open- 
ing to impregnate them ; below each young 
fruit, place a piece of slate, and keep the lateral 
shoots thin, stopping the fruiting ones at two 
joints above the fruit ; do not shade,, nor 
water them over head, except in very scorch- 
ing weather : liquid manure can be applied 
now, with good results. Successional plant- 
ings and sowings must be regulated according 
to the convenience and demand ; now is an 
excellent time for both. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature, from 55 to 60 
degrees. By placing a little spawn in the 
dung of melon and cucumber beds just before 
finally earthing up, very superior crops may 
be raised, while at the same time the most is 
made of other accommodation ; no fire heat 
must now be given ; admit air when re- 
quired, and keep the house dark. 

Musas. — Temperature, 80 degrees by day, 
and 70 degrees at night, 5 degrees either 
way will not injure them. Water profusely 
with liquid manure ; have an atmosphere 
nearly at the point of saturation. Give the 
advancing suckers a large shift into rich loamy 
soil. 

Nectarines. — Temperature, 75 to 80 de- 
grees by day, and from 55 to 60 degrees at 
night. Syringe in the mornings or very early 
in the afternoon. Cut out all rank and luxu- 
riant shoots, and nip off all laterals except 



where required to fill up ; tie the whole neatly 
in, and where thicker than six inches between, 
thin them to that distance. The fruit, too, 
should be finally thinned to about two to a 
square foot, and more if a vigorous tree. 

Oranges should scarcely be forced, yet 
when in a growing state they luxuriate in a 
heat of from 60 to 70 degrees by day, and 55 
degrees at night. The most handsome form 
of these plants is as standards, with a clear 
stem and well balanced head ; prune with 
that in view. If poor loamy soil has been 
used, water with liquid manure ; syringe and 
keep a moist atmosphere. 

Peaches. — Temperature, 75 degrees by 
day, and about 55 degrees at night. Thin 
out the shoots so as to have enough to tie in 
at six inches apart ; do not think of divesting 
the plants of any of their leaves. Give 
morning or early afternoon syringings, and 
finally thin the fruit. A thorough watering 
at the roots is occasionally necessary ; and 
apply with it a little clear liquid manure. 
If spider or mildew appear, washing the pipes 
or flues when cool with a little sulphur vivum, 
is a remedy. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature from 70 to 85 
degrees by day, and 65 to 70 degrees at night ; 
the bottom heat about 90 degrees. Keep the 
succession plants somewhat cooler, and give 
all a moist atmosphere ; air every day. Shift 
those not already done, and renew the heat- 
ing material, if there is no tank ; use a 
roughish soil of turfy loam and peat, equal 
parts. Plant a few out on the Hamiltonian 
system. 

Strawberries. — Temperature, 70 degrees 
by day ; 60 degrees at night. Keep them 
near the light ; water profusely all which are 
not yet ripening ; superphosphate of lime 
may now be given with good effect, or liquid 
from the stable-yard diluted, will do as well. 
Tie out the flower stalks,, and withhold water 
as soon as they begin to colour ; divest them 
of all runners as they appear, and bring on the 
successional stock, as was done- with the first 
crops. 

Vinery : — Temperature, 70 to 80 degrees 
by day, and from 65 to 70 degrees at night. 
Withhold moisture when the vines are in 
flower ; thin and tie out as early as practica- 
ble. The early house should be showing 
signs of ripening, when water must be gra- 
dually withheld, and give more air when mild. 
Keep stopping the laterals, but allow none of 
the other leaves to be taken off. Those in 
pots should be kept in a light situation, and 
watered freely until they begin to colour. 
Keep shifting those raised from eyes as they 
fill the pots, and prevent all from being sub- 
mitted at any time to any sudden changes, 
which are sure to result in bad consequences.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL. 



THE FLOWER GARDEN AND SHRUBBERY. 

Soiv annuals by way of succession — a little 
of everything worth growing, but give due 
prominence to those acknowledged to be 
superior and suitable, for whilst variety is 
desirable, it is quality and not quantity which 
satisfies most. 

Plant and Transplant, both hardy and 
tender annuals ; also biennials and perennials 
generally ; attend to these latter promptly. 

General Directions. — Have the soil tho- 
roughly prepared to receive the seeds and 
plants, by being well wrought, whether it be 
rich or poor ; if it be in either of these ex- 
treme conditions, try and modify it imme- 
diately. The lawns must be swept and rolled, 
and if worms and moss are found to prevail, 
lime-water and soot will counteract both. 
The rake as well as the hoe will now be re- 
quired, yet too great a fineness of soil on the 
top is objectionable, and must be avoided. 
Choose if possible showery and cloudy weather 
for planting, or meet the case by watering and 
shading. Be still afraid of frosts injuring 
the tender growth of such plants as start 
early. 

Slugs are effectually destroyed with quick 
lime ; they may also be decoyed by handfuls 
of fresh grains from the brewery, or what is 
perhaps as good, a little bran placed below an 
inverted flower-pot, raised enough to allow an 
easy entrance. 

Alpines. — Increase the supplies of water. 
Plant out what can be spared in romantic 
spots, but keep duplicates of the better sorts 
in pots. 

Anemones. — Sow early on a loamy soil of 
medium texture and richness ; separate the 
seed by mixing with silver sand ; sow thin, 
and cover slightly, and shade if the sun is 
scorching. The autumn-planted old plants 
will be in splendour ; from the fine sorts take 
away all the weak and imperfect flowers, and 
water liberally in dry weather. 

Annuals. — Harden off and plant out those 
of the hardy kinds kept in frames, and sow 
again early. The half-hardy kinds must be 
shifted and put out by the end of the month 
in a good situation ; preserve the best to 
flower in pots. Those transplanted protect 
by inverted pots, or fir or other boughs, from 
wind, cold, and sun. To keep off vermin 
strew quick-lime around them. 

Auriculas. — Give additional water to those 
in bloom ; also shade more. As the prize sorts 
require constant attention and operating upon, 
erect a stage or bench in a sheltered corner, 
on which to place the plants under hand- 
glasses, raised upon pots or bricks six inches 
high ; over the whole make as it were a tent 
of transparent cloth : reduce the pips to seven 



of the most equal and promising ; adjust them 
by tucking in small pieces of moss or wad- 
ding ; preserve uninjured the powder of the 
favourite kinds. Protect against cold, and 
cutting winds, night and day. 

Carnations. — Pot now, in eight, nine, or 
eleven inch pots ; give thorough drainage, 
and put some turfy soil above the crocks ; 
attend to filling the interstices between the 
ball and the pot ; water gently, and place in 
a sheltered spot or on stages. Plant out the 
worst in rows two feet apart and one between. 

Clematis and Deciduous Climbers will be 
benefited by going over them, and thinning 
the shoots as with fruit trees ; tie and nail in 
as required. 

Crocus. — At the end of the month the 
leaves may be tied up in knots out of the way 
of other plants, until well ripened ; mean- 
while the ground can be sown or planted. 

Dahlias. — Proceed with shifting and pro- 
pagating. The striped sorts are beautiful for 
the borders ; a few may be planted at the end 
of the month in good situations ; they delight 
in a rich soil and plenty of water. Give 
plenty of air to those in frames, but close 
them at night. 

Fuchsias. — Remove the coverings by de- 
grees ; thin out the shoots, and in most cases 
train them with one leading stem. 

Hyacinths. — Slightly protect early in the 
month ; the fine sorts are worthy of a tent 
over them. 

Hollyhocks — Plant them in masses or singly 
in rich soil ; a circular figure filled with them 
is admirable. 

Jasmines, Honeysuckles, &c. — Thin out 
the shoots, before they require to be nailed, 
or tied, and attend to that when necessary. 

Laurels, Laurustinus, &c. — Cut out all 
shoots destroyed by the frost ; the head of 
the bush should be well balanced ; this should 
be done immediately. 

Lobelias are all worthy of attention. Z-. 
fulgens and splendens should be separated and 
potted afresh into light soil, and placed in a 
hot-bed for a few weeks ; prepare a place for 
them by deep digging and richly dunging. 

Mignonette. — That kept in pots may be 
planted out the middle of the month, to give 
immediate effect ; thin out the early sowings. 

Mimidus, (Musk plant, &c.) — These plants 
are all easily grown, and beautiful either as 
single plants or in masses. The musk-plant 
forms an excellent summer bordering, and will 
succeed in a shady place. 

JPansies. — Form new beds, both of seedlings 
and standard varieties ; plant the old plants in 
masses in the borders ; sow seeds, and forward 
in heat. Propagate the fine sorts ; the young 
suckers from the roots strike very well in 
gentle heat, also under a hand-glass, or even 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL. 



151 



without any covering at all, if put in a cool 
shady place. 

Picotees. — Treat in every way as carnations. 

Pinks may still be got in ; cow-clung, leaf- 
mould, and loam, in equal parts with sand, 
form an excellent compost ; strong manures, 
as bullocks' blood, can be used with advantage. 
The blanks in the beds must be filled up, and 
all the plants must have a proper covering of 
soil at the roots. 

Polyanthus, Cowslip, &c. — These do best 
planted out, and can be lifted at any time ; 
strew the ground around them with quick 
lime. Sow seeds on any spare piece of ground. 

Primroses. — The rich double purple and 
white varieties, which are in bloom, may be 
taken to the greenhouse. Plant and sow the 
commoner kinds in abundance wherever there 
is a shady bank ; also by the walks in woods 
and shrubberies. 

Ranunculus. — Stir up the surface of the 
soil, and draw out every weed ; slight pro- 
tection ma}' be still required. 

Roses. — Mark the appearance and progress 
of the opening buds ; if the grubs have been 
amongst them pick them off assiduously. 
Those which are unpruned cut back to two 
eyes, to prolong the season of blooming. 
I Stocks. — Many may be planted out, and 
others brought on to follow them. German 
stocks sown now will bloom fine in autumn ; 
the soil must be rich and well worked. 

Tulips. — Stir (early) the soil to about four 
inches in depth, and guard scrupulously against 
frost and sharp winds ; cover every night. 

Violets. — Strew over and about the old 
plants with fresh soil, to encourage runners, 
from which young plants will issue ; they can 
be transplanted when well rooted. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

General Directions. — Be not over kind : 
the plants must have a good deal of air to 
secure health and sturdiness of growth; they will 
be improved by being set outside on fine days, 
and taken in in the afternoon. Syringe them 
in the mornings. Shift immediate]}' into larger 
pots, if not done last month ; or, if wanted to 
flower early, they should be stinted in the 
small pots, and watered with liquid manure. 
Keep down aphides by syringing with tobacco 
water. 

Regonias should be kept rather warm ; 
shift into larger pots when the roots touch 
the sides ; increase the supply of water and 
light. 

Cacti, if kept moderately warm, will flower 
well ; do not give much water. 

Calceolarias must be kept clean, and neatly 
staked up ; tie loosely, and allow the sticks to 
remain at the length to which the stems will 
probably reach. 



Camellias. — Continue to shift as soon as 
they pass out of bloom, and keep them rather 
close and warm ; old bare plants can be cut 
back, as they shoot out freely. 

Cinerarias.— Shade from the sun when in 
flower; give plenty of air; when the flowers 
are past, cut back the plants, and put them in 
a cool place, from which they may be planted 
out next month, or potted anew. 

Cyclamens. — After growing a little when 
they have done blooming, allow them gradually 
to become dry, but at no time thoroughly so. 

Evergreens. — Pot afresh, if not done, and 
place in an open though not a conspicuous 
situation, to make good growth for next 
season. 

Geraniums. — Give a little liquid manure, 
if the pots are filled With roots and sending 
up flower buds ; air freely, and shade those in 
bloom. 

Hyacinths. — Those in flower must be 
shaded from the sun, and when past, many of 
the late bulbs may be planted out in a good 
situation, and will do for the flower garden 
next autumn. 

Mimulus (Musk plant), will suit admirably 
for the window, either in boxes or pots ; it 
prefers a rich loamy soil, and to be kept 
watered when growing. 

Myrtles, Oranges, &c. — Give plenty of 
light and air ; if they are growing rapidly the 
water must be increased ; syringe and sponge 
the leaves often. 

Roses. — Keep cool and free of insects 
Those which are required to form large plants 
may be again shifted, and all the flower-buds 
taken off. 

Primula sinensis (Chinese Primrose.) — 
Place those of the double varieties raised from 
cuttings near the glass, and keep them cool ; 
preserve the good varieties only for seed ; a 
few may be sown at the end of the month. 

Wardian Cases. — Many annuals, as the 
thunbergias, sensitive plant, &c, if properly 
treated, will be ready to be introduced ; see 
that they are perfectly free of insects. The 
creepers must have wire supports for their 
branches. In addition to other suitable plants 
previously named, may be mentioned the 
aloes, apici'as, haworthias, &c, in small pots. 
Attend to having all the plants in a growing 
condition- before being put in; it is easier to 
keep a healthful case of plants than to make 
one. 

PITS- AND FRAMES. 

General Directions. — This is a particularly 
busy month in this department. Put up new 
beds of fermenting material, and have it well 
sweetened previously r give additional linings 
to those where the heat is declining ; some 
prefer having the frame raised on branches or 
faggot wood, and supplying all the heat by 



15'2 



GARDENING CALENDAR TOR APRIL. 



linings. Have a good store of soils, crocks, 
and pots, under cover and ready for use. Sow, 
propagate, pot, harden oif, &c, and do all with 
spirit. 

Annuals. — The main sowings of tender 
annuals, such as cockscombs, amaranths, egg 
plants, balsams, &c, should be made ; pot oif 
the early sowings ; shift into larger pots as 
soon as the roots touch the side of the pot. 
The cockscombs are an exception to this rule; 
they must be kept in small pots until they 
show the comb, then shifted, and grown on in 
strong heat. 

Half-hardy Plants, as verbenas, fuchsias, 
pelargoniums, &c, may still be propagated, 
but the sooner the better. Pot off the rooted 
cuttings, and keep close and warm for a few 
days ; harden off those further advanced, and 
have them ready to plant out next month. 

Hardy Perennials. — Plant out without 
delay, and give thorough waterings after 
planting. 

Forcing Pit. — Always keep a moist at- 
mosphere, and as soon as the flowers begin to 
open, remove the plants into a cooler house, as 
they are almost sure to flag, if not removed 
before they expand. Beware of watering with 
cold water. Attend to the rinsing of a suc- 
cessional stock of plants for forcing. Mark 
the sorts of geraniums, &c. that do best in 
heat, and propagate accordingly. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 45 to 55 degrees by 
day, and 35 to 45 degrees by night, allowing 
5 degrees more when sunny. 

Ventilation. — Air still more freely both at 
top and below, but the sharp cold draughts 
must be avoided. 

Watering. — Occasional syringings in the 
mornings may be given, and the passages and 
stages must be kept damp. The plants must 
be watered more liberally as well as more 
frequently. 

Potting. — Continue to pot the various kinds 
of plants as they go out of flower ; and where 
they do not bloom just yet, and are likely to 
require a shift, it had better be done at once, 
if notattended to. There are always some plants 
that require shifting; and the soft-wooded 
things and annuals must be kept growing, and 
the roots never allowed to get matted until 
they are in their flowering pots. 

Aloes, and succulents generally, will require 
an increase of water, and should be shifted, if 
not already done ; thorough drainage and a 
good fresh turfy loam, with lime rubbish, suits 
them. 

Agaves, and large succulents, should be 
watered well, but not often ; they should be 
set out on the lawn next month; sponge over 
the leaves if dirty. 



Alstrdinerias require plenty of air and water, 
and continual attention, to see that no insects 
attack them. 

Amaryllis. — Place these in heat succes- 
sionally, and put them in a cool house when 
about to flower. 

Annuals. — Keep these growing without 
allowing them to become drawn : all are the 
better for a gentle heat, but keep them near 
the glass, and air daily ; stake them, set them 
thin, and have them perfectly dry before the 
forenoon sun strikes them. 

Azaleas. — Place in a cool situation, except 
a few which may be required early. The 
forced sorts (North American), may be planted 
out in peat soil, to be again ready in autumn 
for potting. The Indian sorts, after shifting, 
must be put in heat, and kept growing. 

Calceolarias. — Fumigate often, but not 
strongly; give all possible light and air ; also 
stake and tie them up neatly, but do not cramp 
them with the ties. The first stakes should 
be so long that the plants may not require 
others. 

Camellias. — Water well, but do not saturate 
the soil : keep those which were shifted close 
and warm ; all the others require light and air 
profusely. They require a moist atmosphere 
to flower perfectly. 

Cape Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c, will, 
many of them, be in flower, and will re- 
quire a cool place and shade : nearly all do 
well in cold frames, with fresh air made to play 
in amongst them, daily, and nightly, too, in 
some cases. 

CephalotusJbllicidaris(Ne'w Holland pitcher 
plant).— If the house is very airy this must 
have a hand-light or bell-glass over it ; it 
grows in the west of England out of doors with 
this protection. 

Cinerarias. — Keep those in bloom slightly 
shaded ; shift those which are being grown on, 
and have them in a cool frame or pit: many 
may be planted out next month ; cross, and 
save the seed of the best. 

Chrysanthemums may be placed in the 
open air ; propagate by layers and cuttings, 
and only increase the sorts which are con- 
sidered choice. 

Crassidas, and allied plants, must be kept 
in the warmest part of the house, where they 
will not be exposed ; water them moderately. 

Cyclamens. — Discontinue watering in quan- 
tity, where the plants have done blooming and 
have made their growth ; let them get partially 
dry tn repose them. 

Epacris. — Make the air to play amongst the 
plants, when of a soft and mild nature ; those 
just done flowering may be yet potted ; cutting 
them back some time previous to shifting them 
is commendable. 

Ericas. — The quick and easier grown sorts 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL.

flourish well in sandy peat, mixed with a little 
loam, having plenty of lumps of crock, sand, 
or charcoal, mixed throughout ; keep air on 
night and day. Those in flower must be 
removed to the conservatory, but only for a day 
or so at a time. 

Fuchsias. — Keep warm, and water with 
liquid manure ; perfect specimens can be 
grown in this way in one season. 

Gompholobiums, and other tender creepers, 
must be looked over, and kept neatly tied up 
and clean. 

Hawortkias, &c. — Shift, if not done; shake 
away part of the old soil, and replace it with 
brick rubbish and good loam ; keep them a 
little warmer. 

Lcschenaultias will do well in a heat of 
50 degrees, and if the plants are small this 
will soon improve them ; place them near the 
light. 

IAlium. japonicum (Japan lily). — Add a| 
little fresh lumpy soil about the stems, and 
keep the atmosphere moist, and yet have the : 
leaves all dried in the middle of the day. 

Mignonette. — Bring on the successional 
crops ; do not crowd them, and they will grow 
strong and fine. 

New Holland Plants. — Keep these rather 
cool ; many will be ready next month for 
being placed in the open air. Those early 
shifted may be the better for a larger pot now. 
Shift such as require it, that are not likely to 
bloom for a few weeks. 

Oranges. — Maintain an even temperature 
about them ; and a moist and warm one is 
preferable. 

Oxalis. — Coolness and an occasional syring- 
ing suits them ; they require a steady atten- 
tion to watering, and to be gradually dried 
when past growing. 

Pelargoniums. — Continue to propagate from 
the good sorts, and those only ; the tempera- 
ture must not fall below 42 degrees at night ; 
a final shift may be given to those required to 
bloom in August and September. 

Primulas. — Do not allow a yellow leaf nor 
a seed pod to remain, unless to secure seed 
from improved varieties; throw the bad sorts 
away at once, when they are past flowering. 

Proteas,Banhsias, and Dryandras. — Give 
air constantly, unless it be a very cutting 
wind ; be very careful in watering, to keep 
them regularly supplied. 

Rhododendrons in bloom must be taken to 
the conservatory ; a slight shading will pro- 
long the duration of the flowers ; keep all the 
others in a cool and moist place. 

Roses must be fumigated often ; also 
watered all over ; give them plenty of air. 
Some will require a larger pot. 

Salvias. — Such as S. patens do best raised 
from seed ; bring on the old plants gradually, 



and increase by propagating for house culture 
such kinds as S. sp/endens. 

Stapelias. — Increase the supply of water, 
and give them the additional necessaries of 
potting afresh, and extra warmth ; they make 
tine growth in a hotbed frame. 

Tropceohuus. — Tie these again, but do not 
aim at overneatness in this respect ; when the 
pots are well filled with roots, give them a 
supply of liquid manure. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature. — From 55 to 65 degrees by 
day, and from 45 to 50 degrees at night. 

Ventilation. — The quantity and manner of 
giving the air must be regulated by the tem- 
perature externally ; if cutting or hard winds 
prevail, ventilate sparingly, and chiefly by the 
top, but if mild and soft, admit air profusely. 

Watering. — "Water no two plants alike, but 
according to their individual wants ; healthful, 
growing, and flowering plants must have a 
great deal more than resting and sickly ones. 
Syringe the plants not in flower, and keep 
the house more moist. 

Arrangement. — It is easjr now to make a 
gay display ; but it is as difficult as before to 
place every plant to the best advantage. 
Avoid crowding or crushing any plant, and 
especially the handsomer ones. Make con- 
spicuous those which are symmetrical, and 
well grown, and keep turning them daily. 

Routine. — Clean daily, and once a week 
have additions of gay plants, and remove such 
as are fading. This rule cannot be strictly 
attended to, as there are many flowers that 
must be put and taken away within a week, 
still these are exceptions, and do not alter 
what should be a general practice. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature. — From 70 to 80 degrees by 
day, and about 65 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Be careful in admitting air, 
as the sharp winds would affect the young 
and tender shoots now forming. Top air is 
most safe, but in warm and mild weather the 
front sashes will also require to be opened ; 
and a little air every night is of great benefit. 

Watering. — Plants recently potted do not 
require much water ; those whose pots are 
more or less filled with roots, and those in, 
and about to flower, require most ; damp 
the floors and walls of the house morning and 
evening, and syringe daily in bright weather. 

Potting. — Never become weary of looking 
over the plants, and attending to their indi- 
vidual requirements as regards pot room. 
Those which are wanted to bloom early and 
in small pots do not shift ; but when large 
specimens are wanted, do not, if possible, 
allow them to show flower until the plant is a 



154 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL. 



perfect specimen ; and this can only be at- 
tained by not allowing them to be in any 
manner checked; therefore, before the roots 
twine thickly around the soil within the pot, 
enlarge it, and when in a proper state no 
breaking of the ball is necessary ; indeed, in 
many cases, the crocks need not betaken away; 
all such subjects require watering, shading, 
and to be kept close for a few days. 

Soils of a richer nature will require to be 
added to the usual compost for annuals such 
as cockscombs, balsams, amaranths, egg plants; 
have all under cover and ready for use. 

Insects. — Make strenuous exertions to over- 
come the early attacks of insects on the young 
shoots, and even smoke or syringe with to- 
bacco water the house, to prevent, as well as 
destroy aphides, &c. To sulphur part of the 
pipes or flues will kill red spiders, &c. ; and 
keeping the atmosphere moist and of a sweet 
nature Avill counteract the probability of the 
plants ever becoming swarmed. 

Achimenes. — Attend strictly to having the 
foliage dry before the sun strikes upon them, 
as from inattention to this, the leaves get 
blotched. Many of them should now be shifted 
into the pots they are to flower in. 

Allamandas, Beaumontias, and the strong 
growing creepers, mu.-t be regularly gone 
over and tied, watered, and kept clean; cuttings 
will strike freely in heat. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, must be grown on in a steady moist 
heat, if not planted out ; some will require a 
shift, and those whose pots are filled with 
roots may have liquid manure safely. 

Aphelandras, Justiclas, Muelliax, &c. — 
Several of the bare plants should again be 
topped, but this can be overdone, and weak 
shoots induced, which will bear imperfect 
flowers ; still in many cases it must be done ; 
cuttings will strike easily. 

Begonias. — All will now be in a state of 
activity ; this must be encouraged. Nearly 
all will do in a gentle bottom heat, and must 
be kept in a very moist and warm atmosphere ; 
after shifting they do not require watering at 
the roots for a few days. 

Burchellias. — If a stock is on hand, a few 
ghould be put into heat periodically ; they 
delight in moisture and a moderate warmth, 
and as they flower when quite young, they 
are worth propagating extensively, which, can 
be done now. 

Cacti. — The flowering plants must be 
brought in successionally. The young stock 
must be grown in a moderately moist and 
high temperature ; liquid manure can be given 
with benefit. Give air freely, otherwise they 
push weakly. Cuttings are the better for 
drying for a week or so before potting them. 
Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — Put in 



a light and tolerably warm situation ; they do 
well in a loamy soil. 

Clerodendrons. — Pot off the seedlings and 
shift the old plants ; keep all moist and warm, 
and allow plenty of room ; a little bottom 
heat is desirable. 

Climbers. — Great taste is requisite to allow 
them to hang down gracefully, as well as to 
tie them around a trellis neatly ; do both, and 
thin out the weak and crowded shoots. 

Daturas. — Shift those struck from single 
eyes, and keep the whole growing in a rich soil 
and moist heat, and trained to one stem ; 
they are very subject to spider and aphides, 
but by repelling their first attacks, great 
power is attained over them. 

Erythrinas. — Put in heat periodically ; 
keep growing, and have them thinned, some to 
four stems, others to three or two, and some 
even to one ; they can be planted out next 
month, and will form magnificent objects. 

Euphorbias. — An ordinary share of moisture 
and richness of soil suits these ; keep them 
rather warm. Keep stopping and propagating 
from E. jacquinijlora ; a stock for winter is 
very valuable. 

Ferns. — Give a general overhaul if not 
done, and shift most of them into a soil of 
rough peat and loam, well drained with char- 
coal ; keep them moist, and shade a little in 
bright weather. Seed can be sown at any 
time under a hand-light or bell-glass ; no 
covering of soil is required. 

Gardenias. — Keep always in a moist and 
warm situation ; shade a little; study to make 
and keep them clean. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Plunge in a little 
bottom heat from dung, and give plenty of light. 
Thin the Gesneras to three or more of the 
strongest shoots; shift as may be necessary. 

Biippeastrums, Crimims,JP 'ancratiums, &c. 
— Encourage these to grow ; give a gentle 
bottom heat if possible, and keep them moist 
and warm. 

Jpomoeas. — Pot off the annuals, and again 
shift those sown early ; sow again, and plant 
out as many as there is room for. 

Ixoras. — Keep in a steady moist heat, and 
near the glass ; stir the soil about them, and 
keep clean ; a little bottom heat from dung is 
just what they like. 

Jasmines, Rondcletias, Brunfelsias, &c. — 
Rest when done flowering, by keeping them 
cool with little water ; assist forward those in 
a growing state, and stop and tie out the 
young and unformed plants. J. hirsvtum, and 
many others are worth having a stock of, and 
can be propagated now. 

Lantanas. — Harden off those to be planted 
out ; unless they are forward they will not have 
a great effect : prepare a bed with peat soil, 
and in a place where new colours are wanted. 



.GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL. 



155 



Grow a quantity for flowering in-doors ; by- 
stopping and shifting they can be made quite 
attractive. 

Lacidia gratissima. — Increase as much 
as possible without spoiling the specimen 
plants ; a plant or two may be kept excited 
to propagate from. The established plants 
must be brought gradually on, and kept rather 
cool. 

Lycopodiums. — It is well to give these 
attention, as they are valuable for the War- 
dian case, or for light bordering, or planting 
in large masses ; they are at all seasons 
lively ; keep them moist and shaded. 

Malvaceous plants. — Grow in a moist heat 
and rich soil ; the annuals may be grown to 
any size, but as that is rather a defect, they 
will bear a slight stopping ; encourage the 
shrubby sorts. 

Manettias, and other tender climbers, keep 
in due bounds by tying and thinning in time, 
and keeping down insects ; this is almost 
daily work. 

Melastomas. — Give these both pot and 
head room, and light, and moisture, in abun- 
dance ; they strike freely from cuttings. 
, Melo Cacti, should now be kept close, 
warm and moist ; and have liquid manure 
occasionally ; they make good growth in a 
hotbed frame. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher plant). — Have a per- 
petual and steady moisture rising about them ; 
the roots, though they will stand in water, 
need not be kept so wet. 

Neriums, may now be flowered at pleasure, 
by increasing the heat and moisture ; still 
retain a stock in a cool state, in frames, for 
later flowering. 

Nymplueas. — Increase the heat, and keep 
the leaves always floating, and watered over- 
head ; if there are any dry bulbs, not yet 
excited, put them in without delay. To rest 
them well, is the secret of success. 

Palms. — Almost saturate the soil with 
liquid manure once a week ; syringe gently 
and often, and keep up a continued moisture. 

Polianthes (Tuberose). — As they advance, 
take away a few of the smaller suckers, and 
pot separately ; give plenty of manure, mois- 
ture, and light ; they have been known to do 
well, planted out of doors this month, in very 
good situations. 

Thunbergias. — Maintain a moist atmosphere; 
keep in ordinary sized pots, and, if red spider 
does appear, sulphur the cool pipes near them. 
Sow again ; pot off the previous sowings as 
required, and trellis them, or plant out early. 

Vincas. — When these are vigorous, they 
may be again topped, and finally shifted, ob- 
serving as a general rule, never to pot until 
the young shoots are again started, and never 
to top but when the roots and shoots are in 



action. V. rosea ocellata is the most supe- 
rior, and should be increased now. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The Indian house, from 
70 to 85 degrees by day, and 65 to 70 de- 
grees at night. The Mexican house from 
5 to 10 degrees lower. 

Ventilation. — Give air at the top only ; 
the Mexican house may have a little in mild 
nights ; remove all the artificial coverings ; 
have the shading material in perfect repair, 
and use it on bright days. 

Watering. — Maintain an increasing and 
perpetual moisture in the atmosphere. The 
terrestrial species will require a good deal of 
water, and will luxuriate in weak liquid 
manure applied weekly. Syringe the blocks 
and baskets, and let the water fall on the 
plants in them ; avoid syringing these and 
every other plant imder the leaves, except in 
extreme cases. 

Potting. — Such of the plants as have not 
been repotted, should be attended to before 
they begin to grow freely ; and where it is 
not desirable to disturb them, so far as to 
repot them, or put them in fresh baskets, they 
will derive benefit from the application of a 
portion of fresh potting material. 

General Directions. — It is proverbial that 
this class of plants are most easy of cultiva- 
tion. The chief desiderata is a taste for 
them, and a desire to excel in their culture. 
The obstacles will excite and not discourage 
the energies of the devoted admirer of nature, 
and who is determined to have nature's beau- 
ties in their fairest form. This rule is 
general and applies universally; and, when 
attended to, is of more value than many of 
the best hints, given in the best manner. 
The lodgment of moisture about the young 
shoots must be prevented, or they will be 
liable to rot off, especially if subjected to a 
fall in the temperature. Drips from the roof 
falling upon the young shoots are also very 
hurtful. A very moist atmosphere, such as 
these plants require when in a free growing 
state, should not be accompanied by a low 
degree of heat. 

JEschynanthus. — These plants associate 
well with orchids : look to their roots imme- 
diately, preparatory to starting them : if in 
pots, shift them into fresh soil ; if on blocks, 
renew the material about the roots. Intro- 
duce them to the warm part of the house, 
and supply them liberally both with heat and 
moisture, until they have made their growth. 
Attend to the regulation of the branches as 
they are developed. 

Catasetums should be repotted when their 
young shoots are about an inch or so in 
length. 



156 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR APRIL. 



Cyrtopodiums. — These magnificent plants 
may be fresh potted ; give them plenty of pot 
room, and vigorous heat and moisture. 

Stanhopeas, which have not been growing, 
may be expected to flower soon, and in such 
case should not be repotted or disturbed, for 
fear of injuring the flower-buds. The same 
may be said of all those plants which throw 
their flower-stems downwards. 

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES. 

Grafting wax is formed by melting equal 
parts of resin, and bees wax, with tallow, 
enough to make it moderately soft. "When 
used it is melted and laid on with a brush, 
just thick enough to form a coating. If 
properly made, it is hardest when cold, and 
melts with a small amount of heat. 

Woodlice. — These are best trapped, and 
then destroyed; or where toads or lizards are 
encouraged, they will keep them under. Any 
hollow body, open at one end and closed at 
the other, serves as a trap ; such as a flower 
pot, or a piece of a hollow stem, or a turnip 
or a potato hollowed out : where the pots 
are used, a little short hay should be put in 
them. The traps may be laid among the 
plants, or placed where the woodlice congre- 
gate ; and they should be daily examined, and 
the captured insects crushed, or killed by 
boiling water. 

JIoss on lawns may, if required, be re- 
moved by watering with a solution of ammo- 
niacal liquor, from the gas works, in the 
proportion of one gallon to four gallons of 
water, applied through the rose of a watering- 
pot. If the moss has been encouraged by 
imperfect drainage, the latter must be recti- 
fied. Where, however, moss occurs on lawns, 
that are not unpleasantly wet, it forms a beau- 
tifully soft and verdant turf. 

Aphides. — The different kinds of aphis or 
plant-louse are very troublesome. Such plants 
as calceolarias, cinerarias, pelargoniums, &c. 
suffer much injury from the green fly if they 
are not speedily dislodged ; and other kinds 
attack out-door crops. For in-doors, or 
wherever the smoke can be confined, fumiga- 
tion with tobacco is the best plan of destroying 
them ; and a calm evening is best suited for 
the operation. The houses, or other places, 
are to be quite closed, and then filled with 
the smoke ; and next day the plants should be 
syringed with clean water. The tobacco 
should be laid over a faw red-hot cinders in 
the bottom of a flower-pot, and then covered 
over with a good thickness of damp short 
hay, the pot being elevated upon two bricks, 
so that the draught of air may reach the hole 
at the bottom. In places where the smoke 
is offensive, and generally out of doors, the 
plants may be well syringed towards evening 



with a liquid made by adding to the tobacco 
liquor of the shops four times its bulk of 
water ; in the morning this is to be syringed 
off" with clean water. "Whichever remedy is 
adopted it is safest to have it repeated once 
or twice within a day or two. 

Garden Tools. — A multiplicity of tools is 
by no means required in a garden, but the 
work always pays for using good and proper 
tools. The execution of garden labour is 
much improved, and the labour itself light- 
ened, by proper care of the tools employed ; 
after use, every day, they should be made 
perfectly clean, and hung up or placed away 
in a situation appropriated to them ; each 
being kept distinct, so as to be easily laid 
hold of when again wanted for use. 

Cuttings. — As a general rule, cuttings of 
what are called soft-wooded plants, such as 
fuchsias, calceolarias, coronillas, &c, will 
root freely, if planted in well-drained sandy 
soil, and the pots placed without bell-glasses, 
in a hotbed, where there is a brisk, but mild 
bottom heat, and where the sashes are kept 
moderately close, perhaps opened two or three 
inches for an hour or two in a day. Hard- 
wooded plants, as heaths, or camellias, should 
be planted in sand, over a layer of sandy soil; 
the pureness and fineness of the sand should 
be proportioned to the size of the cutting ; 
these should be covered by bell-glasses, and 
set where the bottom heat is very slight, or 
quite absent. With the larger cuttings, it is 
a good plan to sink a small pot in the centre 
of the cutting pot, against which the cuttings 
may be planted, as they are found to root 
better than when isolated in the soil. Shading 
must in all cases be attended to. Remove no 
more leaves from the cuttings than is abso- 
lutely necessary ; and cut them clean through, 
close below a joint at the base. Cuttings of 
hardy plants generally succeed under common 
hand lights, in sandy soil ; and of most trees 
and shrubs, in a sheltered shady spot without 
covering. 

Labels. — None are better than those made 
of zinc, the labels being durable, and the 
writing indelible. The face of the zinc should 
be rubbed quite clean and bright, with fine 
sand paper, and the writing effected with a 
quill pen, and Burrows and Thorn's chemical 
garden ink, which is the best preparation 
sold. An ink for zinc labels may also be 
formed by mixing together one drachm of 
sal ammoniac, half a drachm of lamp black, 
and ten drachms of water. The most conve- 
nient form is that of a parallelogram, trans- 
versely attached to a stalk to support it, and 
slightly bent back, so as to bring the surface 
to an angle that will readily meet the eye. 
The mo-t economical form, is that of an acute 
triangle, which does not cut to waste. 



FUGOSIA HAKE^FOLIA, 



157 




FUGOSIA HAKE^FOLIA. 
(Hooker.) 

HAKEA-LEAVED FUGOSIA. 



The genus Fugosia embraces certain species . 
formerly called Hibiscus, the former name 
being given in honour of Bernard Cienfuegos, 
a Spanish botanist of the sixteenth century. 
Fugosia hakecefolia is a very ornamental plant, 
closely allied to Hibiscus lilacinus, both 
natives of Australia. 

The plant under notice forms a shrub of 
four or five feet high, growing erect, and but 
sparingly branched, the branches twiggy, dark 
green, and quite smooth, as also is every part 
of the plant. The leaves are rather few and 
a good deal scattered, varying much in their 
form ; some, the lower ones, are twice pinna- 
tifid (bipinnatifid), the uppermost ones are 
entire, that is, without any lobes, and the in- 
termediate ones are usually three-lobed (trifid); 
the upper entire leaves, and the segments of 
the others, are narrow linear, somewhat fleshy 
and slightly grooved above. The flowers 
grow singly out of the axils of the leaves, and 
are large and handsome ; they are of the 
malvaceous or mallow-like form, the ,petals of 
a soft purplish lilac colour, paler below, and 
each marked at the base with a dark red- 
purple radiating spot, which adds greatly to 
the rich appearance of the flowers. When 
fully expanded the flowers are between three 
and four inches across, but the petals soon 
become reflected backwards ; they, however, 
remain many days expanded, which is some- 
what unusual among this family of plants ; 
they are produced profusely during the sum- 
mer months, and flower at this period, even 
when newly raised from seeds in the spring. 

It was raised by Messrs, Lucombe, Pince, 



and Co., of Exeter, in the spring of 1846, from 
seeds received from the Swan River colony 
in Australia. Native specimens have also 
been received from King George's Sound, and 
Flinder's Bay. 

It is a green-house shrubby plant, and 
should be potted in a compost of sandy loam 
and leaf mould, intermixed with a sufficient 
quantity of sharp gritty sand, to render the 
mass quite porous. Being a free gi-owing 
plant it requires plenty of pot room when 
growing; the pots must, however, be well 
drained, and there is no better material fcr 
this purpose than lumps of charcoal broken 
to about the size of walnuts, a large piece of 
potsherd being laid in the bottom of the pot ; 
some portions of the charcoal may also be 
thrown in among the compost when the potting 
is going on. For a full-sized plant a pot not less 
than eighteen inches, and from that to two 
feet in diameter, should be allowed ; they 
will, however, flower in smaller pots, but then 
the plants must be frequently topped while 
young to keep them dwarf; this topping 
must be discontinued two months before 
blossoms are expected. The plants require a 
liberal supply of water when growing, and 
are benefited by occasional applications, say 
once a week, of weak manure water. In the 
autumn they may be partially cut down, re- 
potted into smaller pots, and kept during 
winter in a warm part of the greenhouse, and 
very slightly watered. 

Cuttings may be struck early in spring, the 
plants being previously placed in a warm pit, 
to induce them to throw out the necessary

young shoots ; these young plants may be 
grown to flower in the same way as the older 
plants, and are preferable to seedlings, when 
the smaller sized flowering plants are desired. 
"When seeds can be obtained they should be 
sown at the end of February in a hotbed, and 
grown on in a cool hotbed (that is, a hotbed 
where the bottom heat is mild, and plenty of 
air is admitted daily) for a month or two, and 
then taken to the greenhouse and treated nearly 
the same as tender annuals : in fact, when- 
ever seeds can be secured, it may be grown 
exactly as one of these, and would form a 
very valuable ornament to the greenhouse 
during the latter part of summer, when the or- 
dinary greenhouse plants are placed out of doors. 
Fugosia hahecefolia, was formerly known 
under the name of Hibiscus hakerefolius. It 
belongs to the natural order Malvaceae ; and 
in the Linnasan arrangement to Monadelphia 
Pol}andria. 

ON HASTENING THE BEAEING OF 
FEEIT TREES. 

Amoxg the many experiments prosecuted 
by Mr. Knight, the late president of the 
Horticultural Society, some were made with 
the view of hastening the bearing of fruit 
trees, by grafting them on vigorous stocks. 
One of these detailed in the Transactions of 
that Society,related to the walnutthe mulberry, 
and fruit trees of that class. In describing 
his experiment on the mulberry, Mr. Knight 
says : " I had not any young plants of this 
tree, and therefore could only make the ex- 
periment with scions of one year old, and of 
these I had only two, which had sprung from 
the roots of a young tree, in the preceding 
year. These were planted in pots, and raised 
to the bearing branches of an old tree, by 
placing them on the top of poles placed in the 
earth ; and they were grafted, by approach, 
with parts of the bearing branches. The 
young grafted tree bore fruit the third year, 
and continued annually productive. In the 
spring I introduced it into my Vinery, where 
its fruit ripened, in he greatest state of per- 
fection. Both the walnut and mulberry tree 
succeed so ill when grafted, unless by approach, 
that I can scarcely recommend attempts to 
graft them in any other way ; but when they 
succeed by other modes of grafting, nearly the 
same advantages will probably be obtained ; 
the habit of the bearing branch is, however, 
least disturbed by grafting by approach. The 
Spanish chestnut succeeds readily when grafted 
in almost any of the usual ways, and when 
the grafts are taken from bearing branches, the 
young trees afford blossoms in the succeeding 
year : and I am much inclined to think, from 
experiments I have made on this tree, that 
by selecting those varieties which ripen their 



fruit early in the autumn, and by propagating 
with grafts or buds from young and vigorous 
trees of that kind, which have just attained 
the age necessary to enable them to bear fruit, 
it might be cultivated with much advantage 
in this country, both for its fruit and timber. 
I have tried similar experiments on many other 
species of trees, 'and always with the same 
result ; and I entertain no doubt that the 
effects of time might be thus anticipated in 
the culture of any fruit which is not produced 
till the seedling trees acquire a considerable 
age. For I am thoroughly confident, from 
very extensive and long experience, that the 
graft derives nutriment only, and not growth, 
from the young stock in which it is inserted ; 
and that with the life of the parent stock the 
graft retains its habit and its constitution." 

This practice of Mr. Knight is analogous, 

both in its principles and object, to that of 

budding or grafting seedling varieties of fruifc 

! trees upon healthy trees in a matured bearing 

1 state. In this way seedling fruits that would 

probably take ten or a dozen years to arrive 

; at a fruit-bearing state, may often be fruited in 

the third year from their being raised. The 

mode of uniting the two plants should be that 

\ which is most successful with the particular 

; kind of fruit ; thus budding would be proper 

in the case of peach trees, and grafting would 

be preferable for apples or pears. 

The difference between the two plans is 
' this : — Mr. Knight's object was to produce a 
! young plant from the bearing branches of a 
fruit tree, in such a way that it would go on 
bearing when detatched as an independent tree; 
and this it would do by having at once ascend- 
ency over the roots, so that the latter had not 
power to excite it into luxurious unfruitful 
growth. In the case of uniting seedling plants 
with old established trees, the object is to re- 
| move the former from the ascendant influence of 
j their own roots, which causes luxuriant growth 
— proper for the establishment of the tree, but 
; as yet unfavourable to its fruitfulness — and to 
bring them within the influence of the elabo- 
rated sap of a mature tree, which does not 
I favour excessive growth, but the formation of 
I blossoms and of fruit. 

Mr. Knight's plan may be practically applied 
with advantage where small plants for fruiting 
in pots are required of any of those kinds of 
fruit which naturally grow large before they 
arrive at a bearing state.

Leaves Jive in a Sheath, 



Pinus Cembra. 



a. Scales of cones thickened and spine- 
less at apex. 

Pinus obcarpa, Schiede (egg-fruited Pine). 
■ — Leaves in fives, very slender, and from eight 
to twelve inches long. Cones round, ovate, 
smooth, hard, with truncated scales. 

A native of the mountains and valleys of 
Mexico, attaining to the height of 40 feet, but 
considered to be too tender for the climate of 
England. The plant is as yet scarce. 

; Pinus leiophylla, Schiede and Deppe 
(smooth-leaved Pine). — Leaves five together, 
very slender and pendent, thickly set on the 
branches, and at the extremities of the shoots 
in close tufts, about five inches long, light 
green, slightly serrated, and covered with dot- 
ted lines ; sheaths of a bright brown, deci- 
duous. Cones two inches long, ovate, pendu- 
lous, on a very short stalk, with depressed 
truncate scales. Seeds very small. 

A tree of 60 feet high and upwards, dis- 
covered by Schiede and Deppe, on the cold 
regions of Mexico, and which gives every 
promise of proving hardy in this country. 
The leaves resemble those of the Weymouth 
Pine, to which it is no doubt related. There 
are plants at Dropmore from 15 feet to 20 
feet in height ; and it is also in the Pinetums 
at Chatsworth, Hendon, and Woburn. The 
tree has a tufted, irregular outline, and can- 
not fail to be in request as a first-rate orna- 
mental object. The timber is said to be 
valuable for various purposes. 



Pinus Montezumoe, Lambert (Montezu- 
ma's Pine). — Leaves five together, rigid, 
lanceolate rough-edged, glaucous green, bear- 
ing dotted lines, and about six inches long, 
with persistent sheaths. Cones bright brown, 
ovate, oblong, about the same length as the 
leaves, with very thick truncated scales, 
elevated at the apex. 

A native of Orizaba and other mountains 
of Mexico, to the height of 11,000 feet above 
the sea, and probably suited to the open air 
throughout Britain. The species is con- 
founded by some writers with P. occidentalis, 
the cones of which are only three inches long. 
The tree, in its native habitations, is repre- 
sented as attaining the height of 100 feet, 
covered with a thick, cracked bark, like the 
common Scotch pine. It is as yet scarce in 
collections. 

Pinus Jilifolia, Hartweg (thread-leaved 
Pine). — Leaves five together, slender, acutely 
triangular, and upwards of a foot in length. 
Cones almost stalkless, nine inches long, 
about three inches in diameter at the base, 
ovate-acuminate, with pyramidal depressed 
scales. 

A noble tree, found by Mr. Hartweg, in the 
province of Guatemala, a mountainous country 
which extends along the coast of the Pacific, 
bounded by Vera Paz and Chiapa, the Hon- 
duras, and Nicaragua. Of its habits, timber, 
&c, very little is yet (1846) known. A 
plant was tried at Pozelle, Ayrshire, in 1845 ; 
but " it was destroyed by the winter." 

Pinus Pseudo-Strobus, Lindley (false

CONINERiE. THE PINUS, OR PINE TREE. 



"Weymouth Pine). — Leaves in fives, slender, 
bright glaucous green, very fine. Cones four 
inches long, and nearly two inches in diameter 
in the middle, ovate, whorled. 

A fine tree, found on the mountains of 
Mexico, having the appearance of Pinus 
Strobus, but differing from that tree in hav- 
ing cones in which no resemblance can be 
traced to those of the Weymouth Pine. 

Pinus Apulcensis, Lindley (Apulco Pine). 
— Leaves five, slender, six inches long, and 
glaucous. Cones pendulous, ovate, and 
whorled, from four to six inches long, covered 
■with minute elevations, and having erect, 
tapering scales, sometimes hooked. 

A tree growing to the height of 50 feet, on 
slopes of hills and in ravines in Mexico. It 
flourishes in the hot and unwholesome air of 
Acapulco, where it was first discovered, and 
is therefore not likely to prove hardy in this 
country. 

Pinus Orizabce, Gordon (Orizaba Pine). — 
Leaves in fives, very slender, sharp-pointed, 
triquetrous, from eight to nine inches long, 
of a light green colour, and thickly set on the 
branches ; sheaths persistent, about half an 
inch long, rather smooth and entire. Cones in 
clusters of four or five, pendulous, from four 
to five inches long, and two and a half 
inches broad at the base, straight and tapering 
to a point, with elevated, slightly hooked 
scales, half an inch across, each enclosing two 
small seeds, with wings nearly an inch in 
length. 

A tree of moderate size, inhabiting the 
mountain of Orizaba, in Mexico. In habit 
and foliage this pine much resembles P. 
Pseudo- Strobus, but the cones are very dif- 
ferent from those of that kind, and are more 
like those of P. macrophylla, though not more 
than half their size. The cones have a foot- 
stalk nearly an inch in length. The branches 
are numerous, spreading, rather irregular, 
slightly incurved, and slender, with rough 
bark, and large, imbricated buds, totally des- 
titute of resinous matter. It has been 
recently (1846) raised in the garden of the 
Horticultural Society, but no positive evi- 
dence as to its hardiness has yet been obtained. 

Pijius Itusselllana, Lindley (Duke of Bed- 
ford's Pine). — Leaves five together, very long, 
slender, with sheaths upwards of an inch in 
length. Cones seven inches long and two 
inches wide near to the base, bearing pyrami- 
dal obtuse scales. 

A large tree, native of Mexico, on moun- 
tains near Real del Monte, and found to be 
tolerably hardy in the climate of Scotland. 
Specimens are in the garden of the London 
Horticultural Society, and in the Pinetum at 
Rozelle, Ayrshire. It is a highly ornamental 
and vigorous looking tree. 



Pinus Devoniana, Lindley (Duke of De- 
vonshire's Pine). — Leaves five together, very 
long and slender, with sheaths nearly an 
inch long. Cones ten inches in length, pen- 
dulous, horn-like, growing singly, about three 
inches across near the base, and tapering to 
somewhat less than two inches across at top. 
Scales polished, obtuse. 

A noble tree, from seventy feet to eighty 
feet high, found on elevated districts, between 
Real del Monte and Regla, in Mexico, and 
bearing there the name of Pino bianco or P. real. 
Not likely to prove serviceable as a timber 
tree in this country. The young shoots are 
thick and succulent, being nearly an inch in 
diameter, and evidently require a high tempe- 
rature to ripen them. 

Pinus Hartwegii, Lindley (Hartiveg's 
Pine). — Leaves four or five together, six 
inches long, and slender. Cones in pendulous 
clusters, oblong, obtuse, four inches long, with 
depressed scales, truncate, and of a greyish 
brown colour. 

A tree found by Mr. Hartweg on the 
mountains of Mexico, growing to the height 
of from forty to fifty feet. Considered rather 
too tender for the climate of England ; but not 
yet sufficiently tested in this respect. 

Pinus Grenvillem, Gordon (Lady Gren- 
ville's Pine). — Leaves in fives, robust, tri- 
quetrous, thickly set, and fourteen inches in 
length on the wild specimens ; sheaths persis- 
tent, nearly an inch and a half in length, - 
rough and scaly. Cones pendulous, solitary, 
sixteen inches long, and three inches and a 
half broad at the base, quite straight, tapering 
from the base to the point, with slightly 
elevated blunt scales, three quarters of an 
inch broad. Seeds, medium sized, with broad 
two-cleft wings. 

A noble tree, found plentifully on the high- 
est parts of the Cerro de San Juan, or Saddle 
mountain, near Tepic, in Mexico, where it 
grows from sixty to eighty feet high. The 
branches are irregular and very robust, with 
large imbricated non-resinous buds, thickly 
set with long narrow brown scales. The 
leaves a good deal resemble those of P. 
macrophijlla, but are rather longer. The long 
straight cones and stout foliage, at once dis- 
tinguish this pine. In Mexico, it is called 
by the natives " ocote macho" or male pine. 
Young plants have been recently (1846) 
raised in the garden of the Horticultural 
Society, where it was sent by Mr. Hartweg. 
It is expected to be hardy. 

Pinus Gordoniana, Hartweg (Gordon's 
Pine). — Leaves in fives, rather slender, 
triquetrous, dense, light green, and longer 
than any others ; sheaths persistent, about an 
inch and a quarter long, rough and scaly. 
Cones on footstalks half an inch long, pendu-

lous, mostly solitary, from four to five inches 
long, and an inch and a half broad at the base, 
slightly curved, with slightly elevated scales, 
half an inch broad ; seeds small, with narrow 
wings. 

A handsome tree, found sparingly on the 
colder parts of the Cerro de San Juan, or 
Saddle mountain, near Tepic, in Mexico, 
where it grows from sixty to eighty feet high. 
The branches are numerous, regular, not very 
robust, with very scaly non-resinous buds of 
moderate size. This pine has the longest and 
finest foliage of any kind yet introduced. 
The cones are quite destitute of resin. In 
Mexico the natives call it " ocote hembra" 
or female pine. It has been recently (1846) 
raised in the garden of the Horticultural 
Society from seeds sent by Mr. Hartweg, and 
is expected to prove hardy. 

b. Scales of cones thickened and spiny at 
apex. 

Pinus occidentalis, Swartz (West Indian 
Pine). — Leaves five, about seven inches long, 
slender, of a pale green ; sheaths about half 
an inch in length, remaining on the branches. 
Cones ovate, oblong, half the length of the 
leaves, stalked, with rounded angular scales, 
terminated by a small sharp prickle. 

A native of the mountains of St. Domingo, 
about 6,000 feet above the sea, where the 
climate is cold. Notwithstanding this, it does 
not stand the open air in England, though in 
the south of France it is expected to become 
acclimatized. 

Pinus macrophylla, Lindley (long-leaved 
Pine). — -Leaves in fives, robust, very long 
(fifteen inches). Cones scattered over the tree 
singly, about six inches long and three inches 
across near the base, of an ovate tapering 
form, with scales surmounted with strong 
hooked blunt prickles. 

A native of the north of Mexico, on moun- 
tains, where it assumes the character of a small 
tree only. 

c. Scales of cones flat and compressed at 
the apex. 

Pinus excelsa, Wallich (lofty or Bhotan 
Pine). — Leaves five together, six to seven 
inches long, loose, slender, glaucous green, 
narrow, and pendulous. Cones longer than 
the leaves, smooth, cylindrical, attenuated 
towards the apex, and surmounted with broad 
shining, light brown, wedge-shaped scales. 
Young buds conical, ending in a some- 
what sharp point. Seeds ovate, with a bony 
covering, very much resembling those of 
P. Strobus, but with a thicker and stronger 
shell. 

A lofty and beautiful tree, well known 
throughout Upper India under the name of 
Kyle, Chilla, and Kuel. It was introduced 



about 1823, and there is no donbt of its proving 
a great acquisition to the British arborist, both 
as a timber tree, and as a most graceful object 
on the lawn and mountain side. It is perfectly 
hardy in Britain, and in any free soil grows 
with great rapidity. In the neighbourhood of 
Mussourie, whence the writer has had packages 
of seed, this pine is found in company with 
the Cedrus Deodara and JPicea Webbiana. 
The tree has a striking resemblance to P. 
Strobus, but the former has longer and richer 
foliage, and the young shoots are flatter and 
thicker. The soil it prefers is a deep sandy 
loam, in which it displays itself to great ad- 
vantage. For the sake of those who have 
friends in India, and who wish to import seeds 
of this tree, it is important to state that there 
is no necessity for having them sent by the 
overland mail ; for on account of the bony 
covering in which the kernels are enveloped, 
a six months' voyage does not at all impair 
them. Steeping the seeds in wai*m water for 
a few days previous to sowing, is an excellent 
plan. They grow extremely well sown in the 
open air, in sandy loam, and covered to the 
depth of half an inch. They require to be 
kept uniformly moist, and if shaded from the 
mid-day sun by a few dead branches, they will 
succeed all the better. The best time for 
sowing them is the end of April ; and if pro- 
perly treated, they will be fit to be potted in 
the last week of September following. If 
potted at this date, they will furnish them- 
selves with new roots before the winter sets 
in, and thus be the more able to withstand its 
severity. The country is already full of beau- 
tiful specimens of this tree. It has been 
planted in considerable numbers on the estate 
of Sir Edward North Buxton, in the parish of 
Runton, Norfolk, where it thrives luxuriantly. 
Mr. Locke, of Rozelle, gives it as his opinion 
that " the plant delights in free air and a good 
breeze." 

It is impossible to state what it will become 
in this country as an ornamental object. Its 
perfect hardiness and rapidity of growth give 
promise that it will at any rate form a large 
tree. There is only the impress of beauty 
upon it now in the usual outlines of youthful- 
ness. "We have no dark forest sides of this 
species ; few trees of it which tempests have 
vexed ; and none moulded into the picturesque 
forms of extreme age. Throughout Hindostan 
it is called Raesula, or King of the Firs ; and 
Dr. Royle states, " that travellers in the 
Himalayas frequently call it the "Weeping Fir, 
from its remarkable drooping branches." One- 
year seedling plants are sold at 2s. per dozen ; 
and those a foot in height at from 6s. to 9s. 
per dozen. (1847.) 

P. Strobus, Linnasus (Strobus, or Weymouth 
Pine). — Leaves in fives, of a fine light bluish

CONIFER-I. THE PINTS, OR PINE TREE. 



green, nearly four inches long, slender, with- ■ 
out sheaths. Cones long and narrow, with 
thin smooth scales rounded at the base, on 
short peduncles ; similar to those of P. excelsa, 
but smaller ; seeds with wings one inch in 
length. 

A very tall tree, from 120 to 180 feet, in- 
troduced in 1705, and growing freely in some 
districts of England, though not attaining a 
height beyond 100 feet. A native of North 
America, delighting most in somewhat rich 
soils, on slopes of hills and in moist valleys 
near to rivers. It attains its largest dimen- 
sions in New Hampshire, in the state of Ver- 
mont, where, according to Michaux, it accom- 
modates itself to a variety of soils, except 
such as consist of pure sand, and such as are 
under water occasionally. The finest and 
largest specimens he found in valleys, into 
which the soil had been washed from the 
mountains :: in such places the species reaches 
to the height of 150 feet, the trunk at the sur- 
face of the ground being about five feet in 
diameter. In such situations it unites ail the 
valuable properties by which it is character- 
ized, and especially those of fineness of texture 
and lightness. The wood of this tree is in 
very general use throughout America, and 
large quantities of it are sent to England under 
the name TThite Pine. It is, however, far 
inferior in quality to that imported from the 
north of Europe, being soft, liable to the dry 
rot, and lasting but for a short time. Mr. 
Copland, in his Evidence before a Committee 
of the House of Commons, says, with reference 
to this tree, '•' It is not allowed by any pro- 
fessional man under government to be used, 
nor is it ever employed in the best buildings 
in London : it is only speculators who are 
induced to use it, from the price of it being 
much lower than the Baltic timber." 

As an ornamental tree, this pine stands very 
high. Gilpin, so full of extreme artistical 
ideas, has indeed condemned it because its 
stem rises with perpendicular exactness, and 
exhibits nothing of that furrowed appearance 
which we find in the Scotch pine, &c. ; or, in 
other words, because it is not what is called a 
painter's tree, looking but indifferently on 
paper when compared with those of bulder 
growth. Luckily, such fancies are on the 
wane ; and the beautiful in nature, whether 
of rugged or smooth outline, has its worship- 
pers, who are careless enough as to whether or 
not it is suited to take form under the pencil 
of the artist. The pine under consideration 
may in fairness be described as a beautiful 
tree, having a tall straight stem, with branches 
very regularly disposed on all sides, and 
forming a most desirable object in the softer 
parts of park scenery, and on well kept lawns 
near to dwellings. 



Varieties. — These are scarcely worth re- 
cording, as they differ so little from the species. 
In all probability, the most important one is 
that mentioned by Dr. Wallich, growing at 
Baiupa and Toka in Nepal, and referred to 
by Royle in his Illustrations. Plants of it 
are not yet in England. 

P. S. brevifolia has shorter leaves than the 
common tree, and appears to be the same as 
P. S. compressa, of continental catalogues. 

P. S. alba, a plant recognised by the London 
Horticultural Society, has very light leaves 
and bark. A specimen in the Arboretum at 
Chiswick is about thirty feet high. 

Pinus monticola, Douglas (mountain Pine). 
— Leaves five together, rigid, three and a half 
inches long, and obtuse, of a glaucous green 
colour. Cones very much resembling those 
of P. Strobus, only somewhat thicker, about 
seven inches long, and of an ash-yellow colour 
with loose pointed scales. 

A fine tree discovered by Douglas, and in- 
troduced in 1831. From its close resemblance 
to P. Strobus, there appears to be no good 
ground for retaining it as a distinct species. 
The cone, which is held by botanists as one of 
the chief indications of a distinctive difference, 
is so like that of P. Strobus that it is difficult 
to distinguish the one from the other. The 
tree is found on the high mountains at the 
Grand Rapids of the Columbia, and on the rocky 
banks of the Spokan river in California. 
There is a plant in the garden of the Horti- 
cultural Society ; and there are likewise fine 
specimens at Hendon Rectory and at Elvaston 
Castle. It has been found hardy enough to 
stand in the climate of Scotland. 

Pinus Lambertiana, Douglas (Lambert's 
Pine). — Leaves five together, stiff, bright 
green, rough, and without sheaths. Cones 
cylindrical, thick, fifteen inches long, with 
loose, broad, rounded scales. Seeds like those 
of P. Pinea, large, oval, nearly an inch in 
length, and edible. 

An enormous tree, found by Douglas in 
sandy plains where no other vegetation exists, 
in New Albion, on the north-west coast of 
North America, and growing to the extra- 
ordinary height of 200 feet. Its discoverer 
thus describes it : — " One specimen which had 
been blown clown by the wind, and which was 
certainly not the largest, was of the following 
dimensions : its entire length was 215 feet ; 
its circumference, at three feet from the ground, 
was fifty-seven feet nine inches ; and at 134 
feet from the ground, seventeen feet and five 
inches." The trunk is unusually straight, and 
destitute of branches about two-thirds of its 
height. The bark is uncommonly smooth for 
such large timber, of a light brown colour on 
the south, and bleached on the north side. 
It appears that the trees of this species do

m 



not form dense forests, but are scattered 
throughout sandy valleys and plains, which to 
all appearance are incapable of supporting 
vegetation. Douglas states that the resin 
Avhich exudes from this tree when partly 
burned loses its usual flavour and acquires a 
sweet taste, and that it is used in that state 
by the natives as a substitute for sugar. The 
seeds are eaten by the natives, both in a raw 
and roasted state ; and in some parts the resi- 
dent Spaniards have them served up as a 
dessert. Those who have eyes only for the 
fantastic and picturesque, would consider this 
tree deficient in beauty. It is " straight as 
righteousness," and therefore would be rejected 
for the want of some wavy outline to give a 
fancied effect to the stem. If extreme height 
is entitled to any respect, this plant commands 
consideration ; and many, at least, would see 
in it something of the majesty of Nature, and 
the power of the Great Creator. There are 
fine specimens at Dropmore, Cliiswick, Chats- 
worth, Hackney Nursery, and in the Royal 
Botanic Garden, Edinburgh. 

Pinus Ayacahuite, Ehrenberg (Ayacahuite 
Pine). — Leaves five together, fine, three inches 
long, slender, sharp-pointed, and of a beautiful 
glaucous colour, resembling those of the Wey- 
mouth Pine. Cones about thirteen inches 
long, slender, with broad obtuse scales about 
two inches long, standing open, with the points 
more or less bent downwards. 

A tall tree, resembling the Weymouth Pine, 
but reaching to a greater height and producing 
resin more plentifully. It is found on the 
slopes of the mountains in Guatemala, and in 
valleys, where it becomes a tall straight tree. 
There is little probability of its proving hardy 
enough for the climate of Britain. 

Pinus Cembra, Linnaeus (Cembran Pine). 
— Leaves five together, short, rigid, glaucous 
green, with deciduous sheaths. Cones oblong, 
the length of the leaves, with thin scales 
which,when young, are pubescent; seeds larger 
than that of any other Pine except P. Pinea, 
wingless, and containing an eatable kernel, 
which is said to yield excellent oil. 

A hardy ornamental tree, found on the 
sides of mountains in Siberia, Tartary, Italy, 
and Switzerland, and introduced into this 
country in 1746, by Archibald, Duke of 
Argyle. Some of the finest trees were at Mill 
Hill ; but as Smith observes, " after the deplo- 
rable havoc made there by ignorant or negli- 
gent possessors, it is impossible to say whether 
these trees still exist." When young, it grows 
slowly; but in free loamy soil it proceeds, after 
the first ten years, at a more rapid rate. It 
is easily known by the regular spiral form 
which it assumes. The tree in this country 
is elegant in appearance ; and throughout the 
elevated tracts of country which it affects in 



Siberia and Switzerland, it is grand and pictu- 
resque. It is quite hardy in England; but on 
account of its growing but indifferently unless 
in deeply-trenched sandy loams, it will never 
become common on account of its properties 
as a timber tree. The idea of its being well 
adapted to clothe the tops of many hitherto 
almost barren mountains in Scotland, not only 
with fresh and luxuriant vegetation, but with 
valuable timber, as suggested by Mr. Lawson, 
in his Manual, is quite chimerical. Even 
under the most favourable circumstances, it is 
accounted rather a triumph to grow it of a size 
fit to be used in carpentry, and joists and beams 
of it are only to be had from its native habitats. 

Various plans are resorted to in order to 
insure a full crop of plants, a thing which is 
seldom accomplished. Some sow the seeds in 
the autumn in which they are received, when 
a few of them appear in the spring, and the 
remainder in May following. A better way 
is to steep the seeds in warm water for a fort- 
night before sowing, and then to sow them in 
pans placed in heat. The soil which they 
seem to prefer is sandy loam, without any 
mixture of peat. 

Varieties. — P. C sibirica (Siberian Stone 
Pine or Siberian Cedar), has the cones larger 
and longer than in the species ; the leaves 
shorter, and the plant still more stunted-like. 
The tree has an open head with tufted 
branches, and in its native country reaches a 
great height-*-sometimes 120 feet. Of this 
variety Mr. Locke of Rozelle says, " This with 
us is the most thriving of all the Cembra?, and 
I might also say the most desirable. No pine 
I know possesses more attractions, not only 
from the remarkable symmetry of all its pro- 
portions, but also from the beauty of its fine 
green leaves." 

P. C. helvetica (Swiss, Cembran, or 
Stone Pine), is a vigorous growing variety, 
with short rounded cones, and longer leaves 
than the foregoing,. Common in British arbo- 
retums, and certainly best entitled to be culti- 
vated. In some parts of Switzerland it grows 
about 7000 feet above the sea, and, as might 
be expected, it has proved itself quite hardy 
in the climate of Scotland. Its wood is finer 
and more fragrant than that of the species: it 
retains its smell for many years, and is said to 
be so offensive to moths, bugs, &c, that they 
are not to be found in rooms where it is. Re- 
ferring to this variety, Mr. Locke of Rozelle 
says, "the annual growths for several years 
are about nine inches." 

P. C. pygmcea.—A very dwarf, shrub-like 
plant, more curious than useful, and found only 
in few collections. Some idea may be formed 
of its prostrate habit from the fact that at 
Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, a plant 100 
years old is only six feet high.

NOTES OX FLOWERS. 



Living specimens of the following have not 
been seen by the writer, though it is believed 
.some of them have found their way into Eng- 
land :— 

P. contorta, Douglas (twisted-branched 
Pine). — Leaves two together, about two inches 
long, in a dark short sheath. Cones rather 
longer than the leaves, which resemble those 
of P. austriaea. 

A tree found by Douglas in swampy ground 
not far from the sea coast, near Cape Disap- 
pointment in North-west America, and thought 
to be hardy enough for the climate of this 
country. Cones were sent by Douglas to 
England in the years 1825, 6, and 7, but 
from those no plants were raised. A cone is 
figured in Loudon's Arboretum Britannicum, 
p. 2292. 

P. squatnasa, is a plant noticed by Bosc j 
but several botanists consider it only one of 
the numerous varieties of P. sylvestris, and 
most probably P. sylvestris uncinata. It is 
cultivated in the French nurseries; but in 
England it has failed to attract attention unless 
amongst those few cultivators who are fond of 
slight varieties. 

P. turbinata is another of Bosc's varieties, 
instituted from his having seen a plant in the 
garden of Petit Trianon. The leaves are 
two in a sheath, scarcely one inch long, 
glaucous, and thickly set on the branches. 
The cones are in groups, longer than the 
leaves, with square spineless scales. Accord- 
ing to Bosc, it is probably a native of North 
America. 

The foregoing section includes some plants 
remarkable for their beauty and grandeur. 
As many of them are of recent introduction, 
it would be premature to pronounce any 
opinion as to how far they may prove of real 
use for the various purposes to which pine- 
timber is applied in this country. Their 
ornamental character has been already suffi- 
ciently tested. As many of the species are 
from Mexico, inhabiting alike the valleys and 
mountains, it has been thought by several 
botanists that on account of the great disparity 
of climate in which the trees stand, the pro- 
duce from such trees must present a like dif- 
ference in the constitution of the plants 
raised, some being much hardier than others. 
At any rate, it has been clearly proved in 
several pinetums, and especially in that of 
Rozelle, in Ayrshire, that amongst various 
individuals of the same species some have 
withstood the winters without protection, whilst 
others are with the greatest difficulty pre- 
served with the closest shelter. The inference, 
therefore, is, that before any opinion should 
be pronounced as to their fitness for the open 
air in this country, a fair trial should be given 
to several plants of the same species. Similar 



remarks apply to those pines from the Hima- 
layan districts. Whilst on elevated parts, near 
to the tops of the mountains, there is biting 
frost, in the valleys the climate is insufferably 
hot ; and it so happens, that from the trees 
which are of easiest access, in valleys and in 
slopes, our supply of seeds is taken. 

One of the great trees of commerce is included 
in this section — the TTeymouth pine, flourish- 
ing throughout the vast countries bounded on 
the south by New Jersey, and on the north by 
a part of Nova Scotia. Throughout North 
America a great proportion of the houses of 
settlers is built entirely with its wood ; and 
in this country, along with its kindred 
from Nepal, it forms a beautiful park 
ornament.

upper ones more remote and oblong ; in the 
adult state, they are smooth, and have the 
midrib elongated into an urn- bearing cirrhus 
or tendril. The tendrils of the lower leaves 
are not twisted, but hanging straight from the 



apex, and terminate in large ventricose 
pitchers or urns (ascidia), which are greenish, 
and richly spotted with purple, having two 
rows of fringes down the front, and surmounted 
by an ovate lid (operculum) attached to a long 
neck-like prolongation of the urn ; the upper 
edge of the urn is inverted and beautifully 
streaked, giving a pectinated appearance to 
the inner edge. The tendrils of the upper 
leaves have one or two spiral twists in the 
middle, and terminate in long funnel shaped 
urns, not fringed as in the others. The 
flowers are reddish purple, and grow in a 
thick spike-like raceme, at first terminal, but 
afterwards becoming axillary from the stem 
shooting past ; the upper leaf next the flower- 
spike never bears a pitcher. A native of

THE RANUNCULUS. 



169 




GLENNY ON THE RANUNCULUS, 

ITS CULTURE AND PROPERTIES. 



The Ranunculus was once one of the most 
favourite of Florist's flowers, and it has been 
produced nearer perfection than any other 
subject that we know of ; still there is much to 
do to bring it to our standard. All the persons 
who have written about their properties omit 
the most essential of those not jet attained. 
They say, the criterion of a tine double ra- 
nunculus is, that the stem should be strong, 
straight, and from eight to twelve inches long ; 
the two former points are essential in all 
flowers, but whether the stem be one-eighth 
of an inch longer than will keep it above the 
foliage is perfectly immaterial, because in all 
dwarf plants the more uniform their height, 
and the nearer the ground, so that the bloom 
is fairly above the foliage, the better : there is 
nothing gained by length ; it by no means 
adds to their beauty. Again, they talk of 
" a large well-formed blossom, at least two 
inches in diameter," as if size were the grand 
object; whereas there should be a limit to 



every thing, and that limit should depend on 
the natural habit of a plant, and also on the 
natural texture of a bloom. Set the perfec- 
tion of size, and it will mean something ; we 
have no objection to two inches as the per- 
fection, but to set two inches as the minimum, 
is an error calculated to give rise to coarse- 
ness, and coarseness in a ranunculus would be 
fatal. Then it is said that " the outer petals 
should be largest, and gradually diminish to 
the centre," as if it were possible to obtain a 
ranunculus that were otherwise ; the worst 
flower that was ever produced had the largest 
petals outside and gradually diminished towards 
the centre ; it is, in fact, saying nothing. It 
is further stated that the blossom should be of 
a hemispherical form. " Its component petals 
should be imbricated in such manner as 
neither to be too close and compact, nor too 
widely separated, but have rather more of a 
perpendicular than a horizontal direction." 
This is perfectly ridiculous ; the outer petals 



170 



THE RAN UN CULL" 



should be quite horizontal, and rather reflexed 
than otherwise, and the inner ones should be 
more than perpendicular, if a cupped petal can 
be so called, for the inner ones ought to meet 
and rather cover each other, turning com- 
pletely inwards so as to conceal the seed- 
vessel entirely ; and it follows as a thing of 
course, that no two rows of petals can be 
alike as regards their relative position. In 
short, this is an attempt to define, which ren- 
ders the conditions contradictory to the result ; 
a hemispherical form can no more be pro- 
duced by petals more of a perpendicular than 
horizontal direction, than sharp corners could 
be made with circular bricks. " The petals," 
it is said, " should be broad, with well- 
rounded edges." The less the edges of a 
petal are rounded the better ; round edged 
petals are by no means desirable; they should 
be almost straight on the edges, like a half- 
open fan, forming two blunt corners to each 
individual petal, and the outer edges forming 
the outline of the flower : well rounded petals 
would make a rosette sort of edge to the 
flower instead of a perfect circle. As to their 
colours being " dark, clear, rich or brilliant," 
the colour is such a pure matter of taste that 
we do not see what it has to do with the cri- 
terion of a fine double ranunculus. 

THE PROPERTIES OF THE RAXCXCULUS. 

The flower should be of the form of two- 
thirds of a ball, two inches in diameter, the 
under part of it square or horizontal. 

The outline of the bloom should therefore 
form a perfect circle. 

The petals should be thick, smooth on the 
edges and gently cupped ; they should lie 
close, so that very little but the edges should 
be seen, and that little only the inside surface. 

The flower should be symmetrical to the 
centre, which should be close, so as to per- 
fectly conceal the seed-vessel, even with the 
surface, and perfect so as to exhibit a com- 
plete finish to the surrounding petals. 

The colour should be very dense, whatever 
be its hue; if an edged flower, the edging should 
be well defined, and the marking even and 
uniform in every petal ; in no case should the 
ground colour break through the edging, but 
spotted flowers with one spot on each petal 
are allowable. 

The stem should be strong, perpendicular, 
and long enough to raise the flower clear six 
inches above the foliage, and no more, but 
this has reference to the plant, rather than to 
the flower, 

Striped flowers are not perfect, nor are 
flowers speckled on the edges ; the colour of 
edged flowers, like those of edged picotees or 
tulips, ought not to exhibit a single break. 

The foregoing remarks were necessary 



before we began to notice the culture and 
management of this favourite flower, for as 
we shall begin by selecting, or rather recom- 
mending the selection, of those flowers only 
which exhibit these properties, or some one of 
them in a marked degree, it could only be 
done after giving the points to be most re- 
garded. From what we have said, the reader 
will observe that all thin petalled flowers, all 
those with serrated or notched edges, all those 
which are rough in the outline, flat or sunk 
in the centre, or confused in the laying of the 
petals, are faulty ; and in choosing from the 
stock while the flowers are in bloom, they are 
to be avoided. The real objection to thin 
petals is, that they do not preserve their form 
so well, nor remain in perfection so long, nor 
give the colour so dense. Shaded flowers are 
allowable, though stripes are not ; but like the 
exhibitors of picotees, the growers will retain 
the speckled edges though they are decidedly 
inferior to those which possess the colour un- 
broken at the extreme edge. The true spotted 
varieties have only one spot on each petal, 
but the spot must be well defined. The rank 
in which these different classes of flowers 
stand, is — first, the edged ; second, the 
spotted ; third, the shaded ; fourth, the self's. 
We do not place the broken edged or speckled 
in any rank at all. The selection of the 
varieties may, .under these instructions, be 
decided upon with but little doubt, even by 
an inexperienced person. 

SOIL. 

The soil proper for the ranunculus is a 
rich hazel loam ; the best mode of pre- 
paring this is to obtain turfs from some 
pasture, cut about three inches thick, and lay 
them to rot. This of course takes time, but 
unless the soil is already prepared this mode 
of providing will be the best. Supposing 
this cannot be got, the next best mode is to 
get the top spit of a meadow, where the soil 
is loam, and lay that by ; but as there will 
not be one-fourth so much vegetable mould 
among it in proportion to the quantity of 
loam, the deficiency would have to be made 
good by leaf-mould — that is, the mould of 
decayed treedeaves — to be added, or by de- 
composed cow-dung. 

With regard to any mixture, the nearer it 
can be brought to the same description of soil 
as the rotted turfs would make, the better it 
would be. If the loam be pure, as it is 
when dug from beneath the sod, and what 
may be called clean, it will require three 
measures of loam, two of leaf-mould, and one 
of thoroughly decayed cow-dung ; this should 
lay together in a heap and be frequently turned 
and picked over to clear it from grubs and 
wire-worms. Many have used new cow-dung, 
but this too frequently attracts a fly which 



THE RANUNCULUS. 



171 



fills it with maggots, which are very destruc- 
tive. The loam which should be used should 
be of that description which does not adhere 
too closely ; loam which, when a handful in a 
damp state is squeezed closely, should retain 
its shape when laid down gently, but which 
will break easily when pressed in one spot. 
The ground in which the ranunculus is grown 
must be well drained, and indeed, for every 
thing this is almost the first point to attend 
to. The bed should be dug out from a foot 
to fifteen inches deep, three feet six inches 
wide, and the bottom loosened ; upon this the 
ordinary soil mixed with an equal portion of 
rotten cow-dung, or dung from an old melon- 
pit, may be returned to the bed to the thick- 
ness of six inches, leaving nine to be filled 
with the fresh loam, or rather mixture pro- 
posed ; and this may be done in the first week 
of February. The soil should be put in two 
or three inches above the surface of the paths, 
as it will subside a little. 

PLANTING. 

About the middle of February is the plant- 
ing time for the show varieties, which are 
much more delicate than the ordinary kinds ; 
and being also more valuable, the shows 
are held in June, that they may suit spring 
planting, and so prevent loss by hard frosts, 
which would occasionally take place in very 
hard winters. In planting stretch a tight line 
down the centre of the bed, and draw a drill 
two inches deep ; then remove the line six 
inches, and draw another, and so on till three 
drills are drawn on each side the centre one ; 
this will occupy three feet, and allowing three 
inches clear of the outside rows, makes up 
the three feet six width for the beds. In 
these drills place the tubers six inches apart, 
pressing the points into the soil gently, so as 
to leave just the crowns above the bottom of 
the drill. Into this drill, the earth, being 
first properly pulverised, is to be drawn 
back again, so as to cover the crown two 
inches, and it should be rather pressed down 
upon them, not too hard, but close, so as not 
to let the air readily in upon the tubers, 
which, if the lumps be not broken, and well 
crumbled, would be the case. The beds may 
then be well levelled, or rather smoothed and 
left until they come up. On their breaking 
through the ground, the earth will be loosened 
a good deal ; and as soon as they are fairly 
through, the soil about them must be crum- 
bled again, and pressed close to the tubers. 
The beds should also at that time be stirred 
over the surface, and laid smooth and regular 
again. If there be dry weather the bed must 
be watered all over, not merely the rows, but 
the entire bed, and completely saturated so 
that it will not want watering again very 



soon ; for when the rows only are watered the 
dry parts of the bed absorb the moisture 
away from the roots, and they are soon dis- 
tressed again. When the plants are once up 
the bed never should be dry one inch below 
the surface, consequently the greatest atten- 
tion is required to the watering department. 

BLOOMING. 

When the blossoms rise and begin to ex- 
pand, they must be shaded from the sun as 
jealously as the tulip, but the shading should 
be such as will not exclude the light nor the 
air. Hoops and mats draw them too much ; 
tulip irons, which are some feet high, with 
transparent cloth to cover them, are far better ; 
here they will bloom in perfection, and not 
be drawn up ; but in cloudy days, when the 
sun is not out, they are far better without any 
covering. They must also be protected from 
wet, which would spoil these flowers altoge- 
ther. When the bloom is over, or at least so 
far advanced as to be no longer wanted, the 
covering must be taken off altogether, and the 
plants must have all the rain that may come, 
for two or three weeks at least, however wet 
it may be ; but if it be a dripping season after 
that, the plants which have pretty well ma- 
tured their tubers must be protected from 
any further rain, as there would be danger of 
the tubers growing again. In ordinary sea- 
sons, however, there is not too much wet, and 
the foliage will turn yellow and decay. 

STORING. 

It is not necessary to wait until they have 
actually died down before the roots are taken 
up ; it is better to lift them when they have 
turned yellow, and an inch of stem should be 
left on them. They should be put by in thin 
bags or boxes, with their names to them ; but 
before they are bagged they should be dried 
in the shade. It is generally sufficient to 
leave the mouths of the bags open, and put 
them side by side upright in a shallow drawer 
or box ; or it is still better to have drawers 
or boxes made with partitions like those for 
tulips, and let them dry in these before they 
are put away. When they have thoroughly 
di'ied, the drawers may be put into their 
places, and all that is then required is to occa- 
sionally examine them, to see there is no 
mildew or mouldiness about them, for that 
would soon destroy their vitality, and they 
would be decayed long before planting time 
came again. 

AUTUMN PLANTING. 

There are many persons, who, besides plant- 
ing select beds in February for the June 
show, plant also in autumn for earlier bloom. 
The sorts used for this are surplus stock of 
good ones, or altogether common ones. The 



172 



THE RANUNCULUS. 



beds are treated the same way ; the planting 
being conducted in all respects similar to those 
planted in February ; but the month chosen 
is October, and they frequently come up before 
there is any very decided winter. In this 
case, hoops should be placed across the beds, 
as close down as they well can be put, and 
mats, or transparent waterproof cloth, must 
be thrown over them whenever there is 
any chance of frost ; or, if this cannot be done, 
pea haulm or other loose litter should be 
placed over them to 'protect them, for the 
frost, if severe, would not fail to damage them 
considerably. Then, if the winter be mild, 
they will throw up their flowers early in 
the spring, and it will frequently be a stronger 
bloom than those planted in February ; but 
it is quite necessary to protect them against 
frost, or many would be destroyed, for in their 
growing state the tubers are soft and very sus- 
ceptible of damage by freezing. There are 
the scarlet Turban Ranunculuses, which are 
more hardy than the rest, and these planted 
in the autumn will flower before the tulips, 
or at the same time ; and we have, in olden 
times, seenarow of these round a tulip stage, 
in a narrow border next the cloth, which more 
forcibly reminds us of the fact. The after- 
management of autumn-planted ranunculuses 
is similar to the others. The decay of the 
foliage is a guide as to the taking up, and the 
drying, storing, occasional examining, and so 
forth, are to be attended to in a similar manner. 
When the tubers have dried well, we have 
said they take no harm till planting time, 
but they must be cleaned from their mould, 
and be properly divided before planting again. 
It will be seen that the roots or tubers as 
taken up have several eyes or crowns ; each 
of these is a separate plant, and requires to be 
removed or parted from the rest ; the forks 
of the tubers gi'ow in among one another, 
and they require careful handling to part 
them, or the lobes or fingers of the tuber 
will break. It is easy to perceive which are 
strong enough to bloom, and which are not. 
The former are for the blooming beds, and 
the smaller ones should be planted in separate 
beds, with labels to mark their several names, 
or numbers to correspond with names, so as to 
keep each sort separate. These smaller offsets 
should be planted in similar rows, but the 
tubers not more than three inches apart in 
the row, and the labels three inches from the 
tubers that end one sort, and begin another, 
so as not to mix or cause any mistake in the 
taking up. 

ARRANGEMENT. 

In planting the other beds of named flowers 
it is only necessary to do as with tulips ; keep 
a. book with an account of the rows, which 



having seven in each, we have only to enter the 
1st row number one, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven ; the names to each number thus : — ■ 



FIRST ROW. 

1 Alceste 

2 Duke of Sussex 

3 Commodore Napier 

4 Prince of Wales 

5 Princess Eoyal 

6 Talisman 

7 Zobeide 



SECOND ROW. 

1 Splendour 

2 Ckarybdis 

'6 Prince Eugene 

4 Numa 

5 Major Laing 

6 Dr. Darwin 

7 Lady Sale 



In this way the entire bed of tubers may be 
recorded, and their places tell their names, 
precisely in the way that a tulip book is kept, 
the rows being always counted across ; the 
number of tubers in the long rows only show 
how many rows there are in the bed. The 
drawers or boxes are to be made with seven 
partitions across, and these represent the rows, 
which should be numbered one, two, three, 
and so on. Perhaps the drawers made with 
ten rows are as handy as any ; the first drawer 
would be numbered one to ten, the second, 
eleven to twenty, the third from twenty-one 
to thirty, and so on ; this greatly facilitates 
the taking up and planting, and is infinitely 
better than bags. Independently of these, in 
the beds, there will be a stock of many sorts 
beyond the number required ; these should be 
in bags, and every time the best beds are 
taken up, a good many will be found to add 
to the surplus stock, because one good strong 
tuber in each place is enough. 

About August the top soil should be 
turned out of the beds intended for autumn 
planting, and laid in a ridge on each side, to 
be turned over several times before it is 
returned again to the bed, for the October 
operations ; while this is outside in ridges it 
may be mixed with one-fourth of its bulk 
of leaf-mould or cow-dung decayed into 
mould. In like manner the beds intended for 
the February planting may be turned out in 
November or December, but only to the 
depth of the top nine inches ; the other may 
be all loosened, and when this is returned to 
the bed in the first week in February, let 
there be a complete level drawn, about six 
inches below the surface, and on that put a 
layer of rotted cow-dung of an inch in 
thickness. The soil may then be filled in and 
be got ready for planting, as before directed; 
but it is to be understood that the cow-dung 
at the depth of six inches is to supply any 
deficiency of nourishment in the soil which may 
be occasioned by the blooming of the previous 
year ; and it has been found better than 
mixing the soil again the second season, 
because by the time the plants begin to feel 
the want of nourishment the roots will reach 
the dung. It has been said that the tubers 
ought not to come in contact with fresh dung, 



THE ILANUNCULUS. 



173 



but the truth is, fresh clung ought never to be 
used. It should be fairly rotted into mould 
before it is used at all. A very recent 
writer has actually recommended the loam of 
which the bed is formed to be saturated with 
liquid manure, made of fresh, or rather new 
cow-dung. We will not say that it is impos- 
sible for the plant to succeed in such stuiF, 
but we do know that new cow-dung attracts 
a particular fly and breeds maggots enor- 
mously fast ; and that in most localities such 
a bed would be fatal. Those whose beds 
have been infested with such, will probably 
recollect to have used cow-dung that was not 
perfectly decomposed, and may pretty safely 
attribute the visitation of the pest to that 
cause. At all events, knowing as all ought 
to know, that there is a great risk of fresh 
cow-dung breeding maggots, the success of an 
adventurous experimentalist ought not by any 
means to prevent the caution which every pru- 
dent cultivator should observe in every step he 
takes. If the writers on the cultivation of this 
beautiful flower were right, how are we to ac- 
count for the many failures, and for numerous 
persons discontinuing its culture altogether ? 
The fair inference is that, however well 
some of them may have succeeded under 
particular circumstances, their plans must 
have been bad on the whole ; for certain it is 
that not one grows them now for twenty that 
cultivated them years ago, and the number 
has rapidly diminished, even up to within the 
last very few seasons. Mr. Lightbody, of Fal- 
kirk, and Messrs. Tyso and Sons, of Walling- 
ford, appear to be the best of the growers of 
modern days ; and in the metropolis of 
London Mr. Alexander, of Lea-bridge Road, 
and Mr. Groom, of Clapham, seem almost the 
only successful growers for sale ; Mr. Groom, 
the successor and representative of the oldest 
really floricultural nursery in the metropolis — 
Maddock, Curtis, Millikin, and Groom having 
successively worn the floral belt ; and Mr. 
Alexander, being a sort of London double to 
Mr. Lightbody, and growing them upon his 
plan. By way of parting advice, however, 
to all who desire to be foremost in the field, 
we would say, get, at any cost, the turfs cut 
three inches thick from a rich loamy meadow, 
and let them rot together ; turn them fre- 
quently after the first year to clear them of 
bots and grubs, wire worm, maggot, and 
other living pests ; and in this stuff without 
any addition — except clean sand if the loam 
prove too adhesive — grow your ranunculuses ; 
for no made up soil can beat it, and very few 
can make up a compost to equal it. The vege- 
table mould which must form a most important 
portion of the whole, is important to the 
growth of every thing ; the half decayed 
fibres keep it light and pervious, so that it 



rarely wants even sand ; and there are few 
subjects in the whole range of florists' flowers 
and plants that will not thrive in it, but 
especially those grown in the open ground, as 
tulips, polyanthuses, anemones, ranunculuses, 
hyacinths, pinks, &c. ; nor is there any thing 
so well adapted to form the staple loam for 
potted plants, mixed with peat or dung, 
or other matters, according to the family of 
plants which are to be cultivated therein. 

RAISING SEEDLINGS. 

The only way in which to produce new 
varieties is from seed, and generally speaking 
the best beds would afford but little chance ; 
indeed the blooms should be cut off the instant 
they are past their prime, for the sake of en- 
couraging the growth of the tubers ; so that 
to save seed, a selection should be made of 
the best flowers that are inclined to come 
semi-double, those, for instance, with thick 
large petals which have very smooth edges 
and desirable colours. Some of these should 
be planted in a place by themselves in the 
autumn, and some in the spring, for the sake 
of the double chance, for it will sometimes be 
found that the autumn ones will seed when 
the spring planted will not. In selecting these 
varieties, it is not necessary to have show 
flowers ; if you are in the habit of raising 
flowers, or know anybody that is, select those 
which do not close up in the eye, if there be 
any which possess other good properties, for 
if there be three or four rows of petals you 
will find double flowers among the produce. 

When those which are being grown for seed 
come into flower, they are not to be shaded, 
nor is the rain to be kept off, but as the best 
flowers rise, take off all the others from the 
plant, to throw the entire strength into the one 
bloom on each tuber, or at most let two re- 
main. Take care that they are all through 
their growth copiously supplied with water 
after the sun goes down ; let the entire space 
be saturated instead of, as is commonly the 
case, confining the moisture to the roots ; 
because when the bed is well soaked, the sur- 
rounding moisture keeps supplying the de- 
ficiency which the roots absorb, whereas, if 
the roots alone are soaked, the dry portions of 
the bed absorb faster than the roots, and take 
from them what they stand so much in need 
of. When the pods, or rather the heads of seed, 
begin to ripen, they must be watched and 
frequently examined, that all those sufficiently 
forward may be gathered. The seeds may 
be placed with the stems in a box, and be 
thoroughly dried, when they may be scraped 
off with the back of a knife, and mixed with 
very dry sand, in which they must be well 
rubbed together, so as to separate them pro- 
perly, because they cannot well be sown too 



174 



THE RANUNCULUS. 



thinly. Some persons lay the heads of seed 
by until the sowing time, and then scrape 
off and mix them with sand, for the seeds are 
only very thin scales, and cling together in 
lumps, unless separated by the means already 
mentioned. In February, get large sized 
pots, in preference to shallow boxes, or pans, 
which are recommended by most writers, and 
fill them within one inch with the soil recom- 
mended for growing the tubers in, gently 
knocking the bottom of the pot against the 
table to settle the earth down ; upon this place 
the same kind of soil, sifted through a fine 
sieve that will let nothing larger than a ra- 
dish seed through it, and strike this off level 
with the edge of the pot. Upon this sow the 
seeds thinly, that is, so that not more than 
four or five seeds would be within a square 
inch, and upon this seed sift as much more 
soil as will just cover it and no more, so as 
not perceptibly to raise the soil above the 
edge. The reason for recommending pots in- 
stead of pans or shallow boxes, is that the 
greater body of earth preserves the moisture 
more regularly ; this must never be allowed 
to get dry, but when watered the only safe 
way to do it is to get a brush, about the tex- 
ture of a clothes-brush, which must be dipped 
in water, and then by turning the hairs 
upwards, and drawing your hand along the 
tops towards you, they throw off the wet in 
such fine particles as not to disturb the lighter 
seeds. There are, however, patent syringes, 
which throw out the water as fine as any dew ; 
one of these will throw water up so as to fall 
almost as fine as a mist, and the operation is 
not so tedious by a good deal as by means of 
the brush ; another advantage is that the 
watering may be continued until the pot of 
soil is fairly saturated, without disturbing a 
particle of earth; and this is one use of the 
finest roses that are made to screw on these 
patent syringes, or, as they are sometimes 
called, garden pumps. If, however, the fine 
rose be applied with direct force, it is strong 
enough to remove vermin from the stems and 
leaves of plants ; therefore, if the water were 
thrown even with this finest rose direct on the 
seed pots, the soil would be washed out of the 
pots. The only proper way is to elevate the 
rose so that the particles fall on the seed. 
These pots may be set in a green-house or 
cold frame, and be protected from heavy falls 
of rain, and the direct rays of the sun, when- 
ever they are too hot, but morning and even- 
ing sun will not hurt them. If large quan- 
tities are to be sown, a bed may be prepared, 
forming the same as when old tubers are to 
be planted, but it must be the dimensions that 
will suit a common garden frame, not more than 
six inches deep in front and twelve at back; the 
frame may be placed on this soil, which should 



be well patted down, level and even rolled ; 
upon this place the frame, which should be 
filled to the height of three inches with the 
sifted compost, and the back and front may 
be banked up outside to the same height ; the 
inside soil being nicely levelled, the seed may 
be thinly sown, and occasionally watered with 
the fine rose : if a proper garden syringe is 
not at hand, get the finest rose that can be 
procured made to a watering pot of one gal- 
lon only, and with careful watering the seed 
will not be much disturbed : whether the seed 
be in pots or in whole frames as now men- 
tioned, the proceeding must be the same. 
Protecting from the weather and occasional 
shading are necessary, and must be given ; 
and every weed removed as soon as it is large 
enough to take hold of, however tedious the 
job may seem, for a few days' growth of weeds 
would destroy a large portion of the young 
plants. Plenty of air must be given as soon 
as the plants appear, and watering must not 
be neglected. As soon as the plants get four 
leaves the glasses may be removed all day, 
except in bad weather, and water must be 
given only after sun-set ; it will be necessary 
to continue the glasses at night if there be 
the slightest chance of frost. In this way 
continue managing them until they have at- 
tained their full growth, carefully removing 
every weed as soon as it can be laid hold of. 

When the foliage begins to turn yellow and 
decay, they should be taken up by sifting the 
soil through the same fine sieve, beginning at 
one end of the frame, which should be lifted 
off, and taking the fine portion of the compost 
to the bottom, picking out the small tubers, 
which will be easily found among the stuff 
that hangs behind in the sieve, for it will not 
all go through again as it did at first. When 
all that can be found are picked out in the 
dry sifting, wash what is left in the sieve each 
time by sifting again in a vessel of water, 
for the earth will cling to the tubers so as to 
make them appear like lumps of soil.* They 
should be spread out to dry in the shade, and 
be then preserved in dry sand until the 
January following, when in prepared beds, 
exactly similar to those for the blooming 
tubers, they are to be planted for blooming ; 
on this occasion they need only be placed three 
inches apart in the rows, although they will 
grow rank and strong, even more so than ma- 
tured tubers ; but so large a portion will be 
single and semi-double and useless, so that by 
taking up the worthless, plenty of room will 
be given to those which happen to be worth 

* The old writers recommend that before the soil 
is sifted, to get out the small tubers, the decayed leaves 
should he picked off; nothing can he worse advice, 
for the stems and decaying leaves are of the greatest 
use in finding the tubers. 



THE RANUNCULUS.

saving. It happens too, generally, that the 
most single and useless bloom the most early, 
so that all things favour the plan of planting 
at short distances. It must, howerer, be kept 
in mind that as it is necessary the better ones 
should have attention and room, the bed must 
be examined daily, and as fast as any that are 
of no value develop themselves, they should 
be removed. A short spud to thrust down 
to the tuber, and force it up, is the readiest 
mode of removing the bad ones, although 
they would come up easily enough by pulling 
out like a weed ; the only drawback to this 
quicker mode being, the chances of leaving 
offsets in the ground, and so being perplexed 
with mixtures afterwards when you come to 
plant others in the ground. Those which 
appear worth saving should be numbered 
accurately, one, two, three, and so on, with 
the date of the year, on neat labels first painted 
with white paint, and the numbers made with 
a black-lead pencil while the paint is wet ; 
these labels should be kept ready for the oc- 
casion. These numbers should be entered 
into a book, with an accurate description of 
the flower to each number, and in this de- 
scription should be carefully noted every par- 
ticular, whether the petals be thin or thick, 
whether the edges be smooth or notched, 
whether the flower be double, single, or semi- 
double 5 large, small, or medium size ; what 
is the colour, or whether it be edged or spotted 
or striped ; and what particular property is 
so striking as to induce the saving of it ; 
because we have a right to suppose that a 
flower may be so striking in some particular 
as to be worth saving for the purpose of seed- 
ing from, and yet be very deficient in some 
other particulars, so as to be good for nothing as 
a show variety. Each variety must be kept 
separately, in a distinct bag or box with the 
number attached to it, so as to be able to 
refer for its characters to the book without 
difficulty ; any, however, that are good enough 
for show flowers may be at once transferred 
to their proper places among the best flowers, 
and may receive their names if they are to be 
named at all. It is in fact better to name them 
at once if they are to be grown in collections, 
though many who are too sanguine in select- 
ing from seedling beds had need try them 
again before naming. Of those to select, 
there are three classes : — The first should be 
only such as are really fit for naming and 
adding to collections, on account of their 
being new and good, better than we already 
possess of the same colour. The second 
should be such as are not good enough to 
name, but w T hich may come better, and there- 
fore are worth another trial ; such as are 
nearly perfect in the eye or centre, but not 
quite, and will be good enough if they in 



the least improve, but condemned if they 
remain as they are or get worse in another 
year's growth. The third should be such as 
have some excellent property, but are de- 
ficient in others, and are therefore saved to 
seed from. These must be kept separately, 
and the next year the class which has to be 
tried again may be added to those intended to 
be seeded, because if they were good enough 
to be tried again as show flowers, they must 
be good enough to give seed from which much 
may be expected ; the very fact of their being 
not quite double enough to name, renders 
them fit for growing for seed, for they seed 
more freely than the very double varieties ; 
but unless there is something very striking in 
the petal, or the form of the flower, or the 
colour, that is a fair advance upon what we 
have, there is nothing to justify their being 
saved even for the chance of being better, or 
for saving seed from. 

We proceed now to the mere routine busi- 
ness for the different months, which will serve 
as a kind of remembrancer, even to those who 
are somewhat experienced : — 

January. — The whole of the tubers should 
be examined and sorted, or arranged for plant- 
ing, taking care that blooming roots only be 
depended on for the best bed, and if there be 
any offsets attached, they should be removed. 
If grown for exhibition or stock only, the best 
way is to keep all the sorts together, but if the 
bed be intended for ornament and not for 
exhibition, some attention should be paid to 
the arrangement, and regard should be had to 
colour and height, the tallest being in the 
centre, the shortest at each edge, and the 
middling ones in the second and third rows 
from the edge : again, the flowers should be 
the same on one side of the bed as the other; 
that is, the variety at the edge on one side of 
the bed should be similar to that on the other, 
so also the variety that is second on one side 
should be similar to that in the second row on 
the other ; for although we have already given 
an example of two rows, with their names 
arranged after a different fashion, it was 
simply to explain the mode of keeping the 
book. The arrangement should be (if the 
bed is to be perfect) as under — 

D C B A B C D 

H G F E F G H 

This will illustrate what we mean by this 
uniform arrangement ; a bed made in this 
way will be found so superior as an object to 
all other modes of planting, that no one who 
desires to see a fine collection will ever do it 
in any other way after they have once seen it. 
Besides the uniformity there should be an eye 
to contrast, for the less they are like those next 
to them the better. These things observed, and 



170 



THE RANUNCULUS. 



the highest kept in the middle or inner rows, 
the superior appearance will amply repay for 
the trouble. The soil should he thrown out of 
the beds, if not done before, to the depth of a 
foot, |and laid on each side in ridges, to be turned 
and mixed for planting when returned to the 
bed. The autumn-planted onesmusthavelitter 
over them, and the earth stirred, and crumbled 
fine next the tubers. Sow seed this month 
or next, in the manner already directed. 

February. — Continue to turn and mix the 
soil as directed in the general culture, and at 
the end of the first week return it to the bed 
in the manner directed. About the middle of 
the month plant the tubers : if for a show-bed 
attend to the arrangement mentioned last 
month ; if for stock or to cut from, plant the 
sorts together, and have labels where the one 
sort leaves off and the other begins. There 
are some who prefer having a row of each 
sort, and when they have completed them, be- 
ginning them over again ; however, there is 
less trouble and more certainty in keeping the 
entire stock of a sort together, and much less 
chance of a mistake. The directions for 
planting are already very complete. See that 
the autumn planted ones are protected. 

March. — If the swelling of the tubers 
cracks and disturbs the soil, let it be crumbled 
by the hand and pressed down a little, that it 
may lay solid to the tubers ; and if the wea- 
ther be very dry towards the end of the month, 
let the bed be watered, but not if on turning 
it up it seems moist an inch or an inch and a 
half below the surface. The autumn planted 
ones will be well up and growing ; let the 
earth be stirred all over the surface, and well 
crumbled and pressed next the tubers, for the 
growing will always disturb it, after the soil 
has been closed by rain and dry weather 
ensues. Nothing is more injurious to the 
tubers than to have the earth hollow about 
them ; on this account that point must be 
always strictly attended to. The weeds must 
be well kept under at all times, and by no 
means allowed to grow. 

April. — The continuance of the treatment 
already recommended is all that need be at- 
tended to. The weeds will grow rapidly, and 
must be pulled out as soon as they are large 
enough to lay hold of. The earth must be 
occasionally stirred, for the watering closes 
the surface. Look now to the seedlings which 
are up and growing, and take especial care 
that weeds are removed before they can at all 
establish themselves among the roots, which 
being small would be pulled up in removing 
the weeds ; let them be refreshed with water 
in dry weather, and shaded from the heat of 
the sun ; warm gentle rains will do them good, 
much more so than artificial watering. They 
will all, both seedlings and named flowers, 



require protection from frost, and watering in 
dry parching weather. The autumn planted 
ones will require to be shaded from the heat 
of the sun, as soon as their colours show ; but 
that will not be until next month in ordinary 
seasons, though in some seasons they will show 
their colours this month. 

May. — The beds will now require to be 
cleared of their litter and of weeds, the sur- 
face stirred, the lumps bruised, and the top 
raked even and smooth. They may have all 
the rain until their flowers begin to open, 
after which they must have neither sun nor 
rain, for either would spoil them, and both 
together would hasten their destruction. The 
seedlings must be constantly cleared of weeds 
in the youngest state, and have regular water- 
ings in dry weather; the established roots, too, 
while throwing up their bloom stems, must be 
kept well moistened by watering the whole 
bed after sunset ; and as weeds grow rapidly 
they must be industriously kept under. 
Where the blooms are intended for exhibition, 
not more than two ought to be left to perfect 
themselves on each plant, and if they are not 
for showing, the tubers will be all the better 
for restricting the number. 

June. — In this month the spring-planted 
beds will rise early for bloom, if they had not 
already advanced in the last month, and they 
should be thinned of their flower-stems, if not 
already done. The weeds should be removed 
as soon as they are large enough. The earth 
should be pressed to the tubers, the surface 
occasionally stirred, the watering continued 
regularly every evening, but not so as to touch 
the flowers. It is of far more consequence to 
water well between the rows than on the 
foliage, but it should be done so copiously as 
to saturate the whole bed and wash all the 
tubers. The wet and sun must, as in the 
earlier beds, be kept off by proper covering ; 
and until the prime of the bloom has gone 
neither should be allowed to reach the flowers. 
The seedlings should be watched, weeded, and 
watered, and may have all the weather except 
the scorching mid-day sun, which would be 
too powerful, and dry them up before the 
tubers had grown large enough to be safe for 
storing. It is possible that the autumn planted 
beds may be dying off by the end of the month ; 
they must have all the weather from the time 
their flowers are past their perfection. If they 
have by the end of the month begun to turn 
yellow, and decay down, take advantage of 
dry weather, and take them up ; let them be 
dried in the shade with their mould and foliage 
upon "them, and when thoroughly hardened 
clean them and put them by, cutting the stem 
off half an inch from the tuber. 

July. — The seedlings will be this month 
fit to take up, as directed in the general culture. 



THE RANUNCULUS. 



177 



The spring planted ones will also be past their 
bloom at the beginning of the month, and may 
be allowed to have all the weather, and to be 
watered if it prove very dry before they have 
done growing; but if it be a wet season, let 
them be protected from the rain, lest the tubers 
should start again into growth. Still keep 
them clear of weeds, which will in a few days 
choke them when neglected. When they have 
died down, that is, the foliage turned yellow, they 
may be also taken up and dried with the mould 
upon them, and without cutting off the stems 
and foliage; and when thoroughly dried, they 
may be cleaned, and the stems cut down to 
about half an inch in length, which may be 
left on ; they may then be put in their boxes 
and bags, and laid by, where they will keep 
dry and have plenty of air. 

August. — The beds may be prepared for 
the autumn planting, and the soil thrown out 
on each side the bed, for the purpose of stirring 
and mixing it, picking out the wire-worm and 
grub, if there be such, and preparing it for the 
next occasion. All the tubers in store should 
be examined, to see there is no mouldiness or 
mildew about them; and if there be, they 
should be brushed so as to remove it, and be 
placed where they will be free from damp, for 
the mildew very soon destroys the buds if not 
removed. 

September. — Examine the tubers again 
from time to time, and arrange for the autumn 
planted beds : these are generally confined to 
the sorts of which plenty may be possessed, 
because, as we have already explained, they 
would be tried a good deal by a hard winter, 
especially the more tender and scarce ones : 
on this account it is not advisable to plant 
scarce sorts in autumn, but confine the beds 
to those which are more hardy, and of which 
there is a superabundance. Turn over the 
soil several times, and return it to the beds 
as directed, previous to the planting of next 
month. 

October. — Plant for the autumn beds, ac- 
cording to the directions given in the general 
culture, and be prepared to cover up against 
hard frosts with litter of some kind, or with 
hoops and mats, not that it need be near the 
bed at first ; but if the weather be mild and 
wet, they will soon swell, and frost at that time 
would do mischief ; therefore, be prepared, so 
that at short notice the beds may be covered 
up against it. 

November.— Continue to provide against 
frost for those which are planted, and occa- 
sionally examine the tubers in store, especially 
the one year old seedling tubers, which are 
very small, and consequently easily damaged 
by damp, and shrivelled up by too much heat, 
for they have but little substance ; and if they 
appear to shrivel, it is better to plant them at 
48. 



once, and be careful of protecting them, than 
to leave them till the spring; for when they 
once begin to shrivel they soon lose their 
vegetating powers. However, if not taken up 
till the foliage has decayed, and when taken 
up stored where the place is cool and dry, 
there is no danger of this. It will be neces- 
sary now to have the litter or mats, or what- 
ever else is to be used for the protection 
against frost, close to the beds, so that it may 
be put on every night, because there is no 
certainty. Even in these months the weeds 
will require attention, as many will grow 
strong in a mild autumn. 

December. — The beds must now be pre- 
pared for the spring planting. Throw out the 
soil into ridges, if not done before, and while 
out it should be turned, examined, and cleared 
of wire-worm, grub, and the like pests, by 
picking them out. We have already been so 
explicit as to the soil and compost which they 
should be grown in, that anything here would 
be mere repetition. The objects of repeated 
turning during the winter months, and up to 
the time of planting in February, are first to 
sweeten the soil by the admission of air to 
every part, to clear it of vermin, which are 
the less likely to escape in proportion to the 
number of examinations; and lastly, to benefit, 
by exposing as much of it as possible to the 
influence of whatever frost there may he. 
The autumn planted beds must be covered 
against frost, and this should be done every 
night, because there is no dependence on the 
mildness of an evening lasting till the morning, 
and one severe night might do a good deal of 
mischief. Look well to the tubers that are in 
their boxes and bags ; indeed, this is a sort 
of constant duty, for they should never be 
neglected long together, in case of an attack of 
damp or mildew, for the progress of these 
visitants is very rapid. If there is any con- 
siderable number of very small offsets, and 
they are at all drying or shrivelling, it may be 
desirable to get them into the ground, lest they 
should dry too much ; but if this be done, the 
bed must be more carefully protected against 
frost than even the beds already growing, 
because the tubers are the most tender after 
they have begun to swell, and while the first 
fibres are pushing. However, in most cases, 
the safest of all seasons for the planting is 
February, for the tender sorts intended for 
exhibition ; and the autumn planting gives an 
earlier bloom for the ornamental features of 
the garden ; indeed, if it were only for the 
advantage of two distinct periods of bloom, an 
autumn bed is desirable ; besides, if the autumn 
bed be properly protected, the increase is ge- 
nerally greater and the roots come finer ; yet 
it would be wrong to risk any valuable ones. 
With these hints as to the duties which

devolve upon the grower each month, after 
reading the instructions which precede these, 
there will be little difficulty in growing this 
most beautiful flower, and we think many of 
those who have abandoned them will resume 
their cultivation.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES. 

Water and Watering. — Rain water is best 
for all plants. Where, however, rain water 
cannot be provided, water from a pond or 
brook should be used, in preference to well- 
water : and of this, the softer is the better, 
generally. If neither rain water, nor soft 
water, nor the water of rivers or brooks can 
be secured, and hard well-water is necessarily 
used, it should be exposed during a whole day 
in a broad flat vessel to the sun and air ; this 
aeration is of great benefit. The watering of 
Ranunculuses is of mo^t importance just at the 
time the flower buds appear, for if at that time 
the weather be dry and parching, and no water 
is applied, the flower-stems will often prove 
abortive. Let the operation be attended to 
■when the sun does not strike fiercely en the 
plants. To water in showery weather may 
seem anomalous, nevertheless, in a period of 
drought, if a slight passing shower occurs, that 
is the time to give a thorough watering, as 
the air is then in a fitter state to render the 
operation beneficial to the plants. 

Protecting from sudden Spring Frosts. — 
It sometimes happens that in early spring 



unexpected morning frosts of some severity 
are experienced ; and if the season is some- 
what advanced, so that the sun has con- 
siderable power, and it bursts suddenly, as it 
were, on the frozen plants, much damage is 
soon done. This is supposed to be at that 
season when regular covering is not at all 
required. Under these circumstances, if the 
plants are found to be frozen, at once cover 
the beds with some shading material, to keep 
off the sun, and retain it till the plants 
and soil are both thoroughly thawed : it is 
quite immaterial what covering is employed, 
so that it keeps off the sun, and does not touch 
the plants. When they are quite thawed, 
admit the light gradually by first lifting up 
the covering slightly on the shady side, and gra- 
dually opening them till they become again fully 
exposed. This must be commenced earh - , 
before the sun reaches the plants. 

Selecting Soil. — Though a loamy soil has 
been said to be proper for the Ranunculus, 
yet as loams may vary in quality, many may 
find it difficult to understand the precise kind 
of loam which is most proper for these plants. 
To such it may be useful to remark, that 
the soil, when taken from a pasture where the 
British Ranunculuses or Crowfoots abound and 
grow freely, has been found to be congenial to 
the growth of the garden varieties. 

Longevity. — Messrs. Tyso, who are much 
experienced in the growth of Ranunculuses, 
state that the same variety may be propagated 
and perpetuated for about a century. Many 
of the varieties, which were highly esteemed 
half a century ago, are fast declining in energy, 
and now bloom less frequently and less 
vigorously. The culture of such, therefore, 
becomes abandoned for seedlings of equal or 
better qualities, and more vigorous constitu- 
tion. They state that the individual roots 
retain their vitality for two years, if they are 
properly preserved. 

Pot-culture. — Those who are so fond of 
these flowers as to wish to have them remov- 
able to their windows or greenhouses, when in 
bloom, may secure this by planting them in 
pots; but it is not the roots intended to produce 
blooms for exhibition that must be thus 
treated. Strong roots of the vigorous growing 
varieties, if planted three or so in a six or 
seven inch pot, in good free loamy soil, will 
produce tolerably good blossoms. For early 
blooms, plant in October, and plunge the pots 
just beneath the rim in coal ashes, in a cold 
frame for the winter. To succeed them, 
plant others in February, and plunge the pots 
in a warm border. Just before the period of 
blossoming, or after the flowers are considera- 
bly advanced, the pots may be lifted, cleaned, 
and removed to a convenient place, where they 
will be sheltered from excessive sun heat. 



PLEUROPHYLLUM SPECIOSUif. 



179 




PLEUPOPHYLLUM SPECIOSUM. 
(Dr. J. D. Hooker.) 

THE SHOWY BIB-LEAF. 



This plant has also been named Albinea 
oresigenesa, by Hombron and Jacquinot, in a 
French book called Voyage au Pole Sud. It is 
one of the larger growing class of herbaceous 
plants, and must have a very grand appearance 
when in bloom. It grows from two to three 
feet high, with an upright stem, at the base of 
which — that is, springing from the roots — are 
the large plaited or ribbed leaves, reminding 
one of those of our common rib - grass, but 
very much larger. At the top of the stem is 
situated the elongated terminal raceme of 
flowers, which are each two inches across, and 
of a lively purple colour. It is found both in 
Campbell's Island and Lord Auckland's Group, 
growing near the sea, chiefly on wet banks and 
in marshes ; and it is also met with ascending 
the mountains ; but in the latter situations it 
exists only in a stunted form. 

The plant is, we believe, not yet introduced 
to this country in a living state. It was met 



with by Dr. Joseph Dalton Hooker, who ac- 
companied the exploring expedition to the 
South Polar Seas, under Sir J. C. Ross, and 
was brought home by him among his collection 
of dried plants. There is no doubt it would 
prove to be quite hardy in this country, and 
would form a very desirable herbaceous peren- 
nial of the larger growing class, suitable for 
the back part of flower borders, accompanying 
the Dahlia, Chrysanthemum, perennial Sun- 
flower, and other plants of that class. Judging 
from its habitat, it will most probably be 
found to thrive best in situations where the 
soil is moderately moist. 

The genus belongs to the natural order of 
Composite plants, and ranks in the section 
(Tubuliflorae), in which the hermaphrodite 
florets are tubular. The present species,

THE HELIANTHEMUM,, OR SUN ROSE. 




THE HELIANTHEMUM, OR SUN ROSE. 



The Heliantliemums constitute a some- 
what numerous group of small undershrubs, 
or trailing suffruticose plants, mostly hardy, 
or nearly so, well suited for rockwork, and 
producing a succession of gay, though fugi- 
tive blossoms, through the greater part of the 
summer. In company with the species of a 
nearly allied genus, the Cistus or Rock Rose, 
they constitute a very interesting group of 
hardy ligneous plants, which, from their dis- 
tinctness of general character, as well as their 
beauty, deserve more attention than they 
receive. They are particularly suited to that 
class of cultivators who pride themselves on 
attaining excellence in cultivating — and col- 
lecting too — any particular families of plants ; 
and though a Cistacetum, or collection of Cis- 
taceous plants, would be less extensive, and 
perhaps less permanently beautiful than an 
Ericacetwm, comprising the whole range of 
what are called American plants, yet as a 
distinct feature in the scenery of a garden, it 
would be as appropriate and desirable, where 
space and situation were alike favourable to 
its introduction. 

The name Helianthemum is derived from 
helios, the sun, and anthemon a flower ; the 
idea "sun-flower" arising from the circum- 
stance of the opening of the flower in the 
morning, or at sunrise, and the falling off of 



the petals in the evening, or at sunset. The 
flowers both of Cistus and Helianthemum are 
somewhat fugacious, lasting only for a few 
hours during the day while the sun shines, 
and rarely, if ever, continuing till the second 
day. If the sun does not make its appear- 
ance, and the weather is consequently dull 
and heavy, the flowers remain unexpanded ; 
and if this continue for several days together, 
they will decay in the bud. The trivial 
name Sun Rose, corresponds with that of 
Cistus, which is Rock Rose, the appellation 
of rose being probably originally applied 
from the resemblance in form between some 
of the larger Cistuses and the blossoms of a 
single flowered rose. 

Rockwork, and a warm and sheltered situa- 
tion, are the conditions most favourable to the 
cultivation of these plants. Rockwork is not 
indeed an indispensable condition, so that the 
soil is quite free from stagnant water, and of 
the character known as dry soil, but the semi- 
trailing habit of most of the kinds adapts 
them for such situations, which also favour 
and secure that dryness of the soil in which 
they delight, so that they are never met with 
in a more healthy and vigorous condition than 
when planted on rockwork. Where it is not 
convenient to plant them on rockwork, a 
well drained border, sloping to the south, will

be proper for them : here, at suitable dis- 
tances, two or three large rough stones may 
be set into the ground, a few inches apart, 
forming a rude hollow between them, into 
which the plants may be put in appropriate 
soil; in such cases, the stones should stand 
from three to six inches above the level of 
the border, and the plants between them may 
then be slightly raised above the ordinary 
level. In the same way, that is, with two or 
three rude stones set around them, some of 
the choice kinds may, if required, be planted, 
to fill small beds in sheltered parts of the 
flower garden, or on the lawn ; in the latter 
case, it will be desirable to regard them 
merely as summer plants, placed there for the 
sake of their flowers, during that part of the 
year and the autumn, and destroj'ed as soon 
as affected by frost, the beds being occupied, 
for spring flowering, by other kinds of plants, 
and, if preferred, planted again with Helian- 
themums in the following year. 

These plants, and their allies, the Cistuses, 
are also well suited for planting in vases for 
the summer season, the dryness and warmth 
to which they are thus exposed being very 
favourable to their growth and flowering. 
A vase planted round the outside with various 
coloured varieties of the trailing sorts, and 
filled up in the centre with those of more 
erect habit, and placed in a sunny situation, 
would have a very fine effect, if the colours 
were blended with judgment and taste. Or if 
preferred, they might be mixed with other 
plants in filling such vases. Being for the 
most part plants of small size, they would 
better adapt themselves to a vase of small, or, 
at least, of moderate dimensions, than to a 
very large one. Even when other plants are 
placed to fill up the principal part of the 
Centre of these vases, and the rustic baskets 
and boxes, used in pleasure-ground arrange- 
ments, the trailing varieties would still form 
very elegant plants for the margins, and 
would succeed well, provided only that the soil 
was well drained, and the situation warm and 
sunny. 

There would thus appear to be in flower 
gardens, at least four positions into which, 
under fitting circumstances, these plants may 
appropriately be introduced. They are also 
possessed of considerable interest when culti- 
vated in pots ; and a reserve stock should, as 
will be presently noticed, be always kept 
growing in pots, under proper shelter in 
winter. 

The Helianthemums will grow freely enough 
in any light dry common garden soil, but 
Avhere soil has to be provided for them, and 
there is an opportunity of exercising choice, 
nothing can be selected, which will be more 
suitable for them, than a light or sandy loam. 



Some of the kinds which are found wild in 
this country are met with abundantly in 
chalky districts, so that they succeed well in 
soil of a calcareous nature. The most import • 
ant point as regards soil would appear to be 
that it should be dry, in the sense of well 
drained. 

They are all freely propagated either by 
cuttings or layers. The tops of the young 
non-flowering shoots, with three or four joints, 
are proper for cuttings ; from these, the 
lowermost pair (the leaves usually grow 
opposite, that is, in- pairs one opposite the 
other) of leaves should be cut off clean with a 
sharp knife, and a transverse cut made close 
below where they joined the stem ; a few 
only should be prepared before they are 
planted, lest they become shrivelled through 
evaporation from the cut surface, and it is 
better too to plant them when comparatively 
fresh than to allow them to get dry and then 
to immerse them in water to freshen them up 
again. They should be planted, not too close 
together, under hand-lights, in firm sandy 
soil ; or they may be planted in pots of sandy soil, 
and the pots plunged under hand-lights, either 
of which will answer. If this be done in June 
or July, the cuttings will be well rooted, and 
may be potted singly into small pots, and 
become nice bushy little plants before winter ; 
and if well kept through that part of the year, 
will be strong for planting out in the following 
season. If the obtaining of strong plants for 
planting out is no object, and a reserve stock 
only is required, then the cuttings may be 
planted in August or September, and kept in 
the cutting pots through the winter, thus 
occupying less space in storing than when 
separate pots are employed ; in the spring 
they may be potted singly. The young plants 
should in all cases be kept topped while young, 
to make them bushy. Thus, soon after pot- 
ting — when they have just "taken with the 
pots," as the phrase is. the tops may be pinched 
out at the fourth or fifth set of leaves, or at 
about three inches high ; afterwards they may 
be topped at the second or third joint, two or 
three times repeated before the time of planting 
out, if they grow fast enough to render this 
necessary. Those grown for planting out 
should be shifted in spring, to increase their 
size and strength. 

When seeds are produced, they should be 
sown as soon as sufficiently ripened, in pots of 
sandy soil, and set in a cold frame ; the plants, 
when large enough to handle, may be potted 
singly and treated as cuttings. 

It has already been remarked that a reserve 
stock of all the kinds (especially the tender 
ones) should be kept in pots and protected 
through the winter. This is necessary, be- 
cause some of the kinds are not hardy 



182 



THE CULTIVATION OF THE FILBERT. 



enough to bear our winters with certainty, 
and most of them are liable to be destroyed or 
seriously damaged if the weather prove to be 
severe. Of the smaller trailing sorts, strong 
young plants, managed as already pointed out, 
answer every purpose : of the others, a mode- 
rate-sized reserve plant will mostly make good 
progress in the summer season ; but if large 
specimens are required, or if it be an object to 
preserve good plants of any choice or scarce 
kinds, then they must either be taken up very 
carefully in the autumn — a practice which 
may sometimes succeed — or what is far better, 
they must be protected by means of mats 
placed about them a short distance from the 
branches, and a good thickness of litter laid 
about their stems and over their roots. With a 
little care and attention in thus protecting 
them (providing the soil is well drained.) there 
will be no serious difficulty in preserving any 
of the sorts, except in extreme winters. 

The annual species are mostly very srmll 
plants, but exceedingly pretty. H. guttatuni 
in particular, which can always be purchased 
in the seed-shops, is especially worth growing 
among choice curious plants. Both it and the 
other annual kinds are raised from seeds, 
which -should be sown in pots or pans in 
March, and kept in frames for a time, the 
plants being afterwards transplanted out-doors 
into light, dry soil in May, or when of 
sufficient strength. The seeds may also be 
sown, both in March and April, in the open 
border, in order to secure a succession of 
bloom. They grow well in heath soil. 

The Helianthemums are very prolific of 
varieties, and, no doubt, by careful hybridizing, 
the size and beauty of the flowers might be 
much increased. For this purpose, the cis- 
tuses might be crossed with them, by which 
means size and variety of colour would be 
acquired; and the different habits might be 
modified or united with improved blossoms, as 
has been effected among other plants. For 
an amateur who might take up this tribe of 
plants, this would be a delightful occupation ; 
and if prosecuted with energy, and guided by 
sound judgment, the result could not fail to be 
satisfactory. 

The fugacious nature of the flowers has been 
incidentally noticed ; this might seem to open 
an objection to their cultivation on any exten- 
sive scale ; but, in truth, the supply of flowers 
is in most cases so profuse, that the objection 
is of little practical weight. When they once 
begin flowering they are rarely deficient of 
bloom, during the proper period of their 
inflorescence — which in some cases extends 
over several months, if the weather is favour- 
able to their development. 

Probably some of the varieties which have 
been introduced, and are recorded in cata- 



logues, are not now in cultivation, the winter 
of 1837-8, and that again of 1846-7 being a 
severe trial for many of them, if not specially 
preserved. They are, however, mostly within 
the possibility of being reintroduced. 

The following are some of the hardier 
species, and they are all handsome kinds : — 

H. alpestre (alpine Sun rose), yellow.

verse, some flowers yellow, others straw 
colour. 

H. apenninum (Apennine Sun rose), white.

H. croceum (copper-coloured Sun rose), deep 
yellow. 

H. grandiflorum (large-flowered Sun rose), 
pale yellow. 

H. hyssopifolium (hyssop-leaved Sun rose), 
three varieties, saffi on coloured, reddish copper 
coloured, and double copper coloured. 

H. leptophyllum (slender-leaved Sun rose), 
yellow. 

H. macranthum (large-flowered Sun rose), 
creamy white, double and single flowered. 

H. mutabile (changeable Sun rose), three 
varieties, white, rose-red, and double-flowered 
rose-red.

verse, some flowers red, others red and white, 
others white.

THE CULTIVATION OF THE FILBERT. 

It is not generally known, except to pro- 
fessional gardeners — or, if known, the know- 
ledge is seldom acted on — that a filbert tree 
maybe rendered productive in almost as small 
a space as is occupied by an ordinary goose- 
beny or currant bush. In fact, under favour- 
able circumstances, the produce of these neat 
bushes is astonishing. We propose, therefore, 
to explain this mode of cultivating the filbert ; 
and in doing so shall avail ourselves of some 
excellent directions bytheEev. W.Williamson, 
published in one of the early volumes of the 
Transactions of the Horticultural Society. 

The first consideration in making a planta- 
tion, is to select a proper soil ; for if that be 
not congenial to the constitution of the plants, 
we cannot expect any great success. The 
soil in which the Filbert is found to flourish 
best, is a hazel loam of some depth, with a 
dry subsoil. If the subsoil be. too retentive 
of moisture, the trees are apt to run too much 
to wood, without throwing out those short 
twigs upon which the fruit is generally pro-

daced. In that part of Kent which, is famous 
for the cultivation of the Filbert the soil is 
loam upon a dry sandy rock. It may be taken 
as a general rule, that soil which is proper for 
the growth of hops, is also congenial to the 
Filbert. 

The Filbert requires a considerable quantity 
of manure; the grounds in Kent are dressed 
every year, or at least once in two years. 
Every kind of manure is beneficial ; but old 
woollen rags are found to produce the greatest 
effect. 

There are four methods of raising the 
plants ; by suckers, layers, grafting, and 
sowing the nuts. Each may be practised 
according to the peculiar object of the culti- 
vator ; but the best method is by suckers ; 
they come sooner into bearing, and make 
stronger plants than either layers or grafts. 
They are taken from the parent plant gene= 
rally in the autumn, and planted in nursery 
beds, (being first shortened to ten or twelve 
inches,) where they remain three or four 
years. They are slightly pruned every year, 
in order to form strong lateral shoots, the 
number of which varies from four to six. The 
most free growing plants are obtained by 
sowing the nuts ; but they are so long in 
coming to a productive state, and are besides 
so much inclined to degenerate into inferior 
varieties, that this method should not be 
resorted to in making a permanent plantation. 
The plants raised by layering and grafting are 
of more humble growth, and therefore better 
adapted for small gardens where economy of 
space is made an object. 

The method of pruning the Filbert being 
different from that of every other tree, and 
not generally practised, a particular explana- 
tion of it will be necessary. Mr. Williamson 
has done this so clearly, that we cannot do 
better than quote his words, which follow : — 
Before any one can possibly prune a tree with 
propriety, it is necessary that he perfectly un- 
derstand the mode of its fructification. The 
fruit of the vine is produced only upon shoots 
of the preceding year ; cherries are grown 
chiefly upon short spurs emitted from the 
sides of the larger branches ; if, therefore, the 
last year's shoots of the vine, or the spurs of 
the cherry tree are destroyed, there can be 
no fruit. Now, in some respects, the Filbert 
is similar in its fructification to both these 
trees ; the bearing branches being always 
those of the preceding year, similar to the vine, 
and these branches, if the tree be properly 
pruned, might with great propriety be called 
spurs, allowing for the difference between the 
filbert and the cherry ; these short twigs or 
spurs are not more than a few inches long, 
every bud of which, in a good year, produces 
fruit. The great object of the following- 



method of pruning is to cause the trees to 
throw out these spurs in great abundance; and 
when they are got to a proper bearing state, 
more than sufficient will be produced. But 
though it is the usual practice to plant the 
suckers in nursery beds, I would advise every 
one to plant them where they are to remain, 
whether they are intended for a garden or a 
larger plantation : and after being suffered to 
grow without restraint for three or four years, 
to cut them down within a few inches of the 
ground. From the remaining part, if the 
trees are well rooted in the soil, five or six 
strong shoots will be produced. Whichever 
method is practised, the subsequent treatment 
of the trees will be exactly the same. In the 
second year after cutting down, these shoots 
are shortened ; generally one-third is taken 
off. If very weak, I would advise that the 
trees be quite cut down a second time, as in 
the previous spring : but it would be much 
better not to cut them down until the trees 
give evident tokens of their being able to 
produce shoots of sufficient strength. When 
they are thus shortened, that they may appear 
regular, let a small hoop be placed within the 
branches, to which the shoots are to be 
fastened at equal distances ; by this practice, 
two considerable advantages will be gained ; 
the trees will grow more regular, and the 
middle will be kept hollow r , so as to admit the 
influence of the sun and air; but this, in a large 
plantation, would be almost impossible, nor 
indeed is it necessary, though in private 
gardens, where regularity and neatness are 
almost essential, it ought to be practised. In 
the third year, a shoot will spring from each 
bud ; these must be suffered to grow till the 
following autumn, or fourth year, when they 
are to be cut off close to the original stem, 
and the leading shoot of the last year shortened 
two-thirds. In the fifth year several small 
shoots will arise from the base of the side- 
branches which were cut off the preceding 
year ; these are produced from small buds, 
and would not have been emitted, had not the 
branch on which they were situated been 
shortened, the whole nourishment being carried 
to the upper part of the branch. It is from 
these shoots that fruit is to be expected. These 
productive shoots will in a few years become 
very numerous, and many of them must be 
taken off, particularly the strongest, in order 
to encourage the production of the smaller 
ones ; for those of the former year become so 
exhausted, that they generally decay ; but 
whether decayed or not, they are always cut 
out by the pruner, and a fresh supply must 
therefore be provided, to produce the fruit in 
the succeeding yeai\ The leading shoot is 
every year to be shortened two-thirds, or more, 
should the tree be weak, and the whole height 



184 



THE CULTIVATION OF THE FILBERT. 



of the branches must not be suffered to exceed 
six feet. Every shoot that is left to produce 
fruit, should also be tipped, which prevents the 
tree being exhausted in making Avood at the 
end of the branch. 

The Filbert is a monoecious plant, and con- 
sequently produces the male and female blos- 
soms separately on the. same tree ; the slender 
scarlet filaments which are seen issuing from 
the end of the buds early in the spring, are the 
female, or productive blossoms; the barren, or 
male blossoms, are formed on long cylindrical 
catkins, which fall off as soon as they have per- 
formed their office ; in pruning, care must be 
taken to leave a due supply of these to fructify 
the female blossoms, or our previous trouble will 
be entirely useless ; this maybe done without 
difficulty, for they are perfectly visible at the 
time of the pruning. 

The method of pruning above detailed 
might in a few words be called a system of 
spurring, by which bearing shoots are pro- 
duced which otherwise would have had no 
existence. It frequently happens that a strong 
shoot springs from the root ; and should any 
of the first year's or leading branches be 
decayed, or become unproductive of bearing 
wood, it will be advisable to cut that entirely 
away, and suffer the new shoot to supply its 
place, which afterwards is to be treated in the 
same manner as is recommended for the others. 
Old trees are easily induced to bear in this 
manner, by selecting a sufficient number of 
the main branches, and then cutting the side 
shoots off nearly close, excepting any should 
be so situated as not to interfere with the 
others, and there should be no main branch 
directed to that particular part. It will, how- 
ever, be two or three years before the full 
effect will be produced. 

But though this method of cultivation has 
long been celebrated, yet it does not appear to 
me so particularly successful as to deserve the 
encomiums which have been bestowed upon it; 
for though thirty hundred-weight per acre 
have been grown in particular grounds, and 
in particular years, yet twenty hundred-weight 
is considered a large crop, and rather more 
than half that quantity may be called a more 
usual one ; and even then, the crop totally 
fails three years out of five ; so that the annual 
average quantity cannot be reckoned at more 
than five hundred-weight per acre. 

When I reflected upon the. reason of the 
failure happening so often as three years out 
of five, it occurred to me, that possibly it 
might arise from the excessive productiveness 
of the other two, the whole nourishment of 
the trees being expended in the production of 
the fruit ; and that, consequently, they might 
be unable properly to mature the blossom for 
the following year. We know that peach and 



nectarine trees may be so pruned, as to force 
them to bear a superabundant quantity of fruit 
in some one year ; but we find that a regular 
crop in succession is thereby prevented, and 
that too for several years. In order to ensure 
fruit every year, I have usually left a large 
proportion of those shoots, which, from their 
strength, I suspected would not be so pro- 
ductive of blossom buds, as the shorter ones ; 
leaving them more in a state of nature than 
is commonly done ; not pruning them so 
closely as to weaken the trees by excessive 
bearing, nor leaving them so entirely to their 
natural growth, as to cause their annual pro- 
ductiveness to be destroyed by a superfluity 
of wood. These shoots, in the spring of the 
year, I have usually shortened to a blossom 
bud, for the reason before given. The. great 
art of pruning is to produce the greatest 
quantity of fruit without injury to the crop of 
the succeeding year, which, in my opinion, is 
not done by the Kentish method. But by 
observing the rule which I have laid down, 
though the trees do not perhaps bear so great 
a weight in any one year, as by the method 
before detailed ; yet the crops in the. whole 
certainly are not less ; with this great advan- 
tage both to the public and private grower, 
that a moderate but regular crop is ensured 
in every successive year. I think that by 
this plan the average weight in the whole will 
be greater. In the year 1819, which was a 
very productive one, I grew two hundred- 
weight of filberts, (weighed when gathered) 
upon fifty-seven trees, the greater part of 
which were not above six years old, (reckon- 
ing from the time of their being cut down,) 
and growing upon three hundred and sixty 
square yards of ground ; which is after the 
rate of twenty- seven hundred-weight per acre, 
and upon part of the ground ten more trees 
are now planted, which, if they had come to a 
bearing state, would have increased the quan- 
tity to more than is considered as an extra- 
ordinary crop, besides having grown upon the 
older trees a moderate but regular quantity 
for several years preceding. 

When the trees are grown on this plan, it 
is necessary, in order to strengthen the tree as 
much as possible, to eradicate the suckers from 
the root ; this is effected by exposing the roots, 
to a moderate distance from the stem, to the 
frosts of winter, and the necessary excavation 
is in the spring filled with manure. 

As Filberts are several years in coming to 
perfection, it is usual to plant hops, standard 
apples, and cherries, among them, and when 
they come to a bearing state, the hops are 
destroyed, and the fruit trees suffered to 
remain. The ground is then planted with 
gooseberries, currants, &c. and an under crop of 
vegetables is likewise frequently obtained. If

is; 



this were not practised, the crop of Filberts 
alone, except in particular years, would not 
defray the expense. The distance at which 
Filberts are planted must depend upon their 
being mixed with other fruit. 

THE EGYPTIAN PEA. 

The following account of this pea has been 
transmitted to us : — A vase found by Sir Gar- 
dener Wilkinson in a mummy pit, with an 
Egyptian sarcophagus, 2,845 years old, was 
presented to the British Museum. On ex- 
amining the vase, which was supposed to have 
contained valuable relics, only a few grains of 
wheat, vetches, and peas were discovered. 
Three of these peas were presented by T. J. 
Pettigrew, Esq., to Mr. Grimstone, of the 
Herbary, Highgate. On the 4th of June, 
1844, these were planted in compost, resem- 
bling as nearly as possible the alluvial soil of 
the Nile, and they were placed in a forcing 
frame. In thirty-five days, one of the seeds 
germinated, and in that year produced nine- 
teen pods, from which fifty fine peas were 
preserved. In 1845, they were sown in the 
open air, and made luxurious growth. The 
pea is described as growing about three feet 
high, each pea throwing up two or three main 
stems, which bear many branches. The blos- 
soms grow several together on short stalks ; 
they are white with green stripes, and remain 
attached to the base of the pod during its 
growth ; the pods are scimitar shaped. It is 
recommended to plant the seeds eight inches 
apart, with the eye ranged lengthways in the 
row, by which means the branches are said 
to be thrown out right and left, and by the 
aid of a row or two of string on each side, 
they will be supported without sticks. Through 
the long drought of 1846, when almost every 
one's peas were destroyed, these Egyptian 
peas — without water — continued green and 
flourishing, and bearing from 70 to 120 pods 
on each stem. The original seeds were very 
small, but by cultivation they have now ac- 
quired the size of our marrowfats. It is pro- 
per to state, that we have not ourselves seen 
these peas, nevertheless they are doubtless 
worthy the notice of the curious.

Diseases of Fruit Trees. — Mildew. — When 
trees have been severely attacked by this dis- 
order, they should be syringed on the first 
unfolding of the leaf, and at frequent intervals 
during the remainder of the season, perhaps 
once a week, with sulphur mixed with soap 
suds, and dashed violently with a rose syringe 
against the tree nnd wall, in such a manner 



that no part or leaf is left unsprinkled ; by the 
continuance of such treatment, and close cut- 
ting out the infected shoots, it will be com- 
pletely subdued and eradicated, though such 
leaves as have been injured will still con- 
tinue to retain the appearance of disorder. 
The sulphur, instead of being in any degree 
hurtful to the peach tree seems rather to pro- 
mote its growth. The collateral autumnal 
shoots being particularly liable to catch the 
infection, should be carefully nipped off as 
they push. — Blight. Under this denomination 
are frequently confounded two varieties of 
disease materially different in their appearance, 
and which I shall distinguish by the appella- 
tions of blister and curl. The former is 
generally confined to such peach trees as have 
glandular leaves, which are mostly subject to 
it in the months of April and May; and when 
attacked, it is not until the latter part of the 
season, if at all, that they become healthy and 
convalescent. The leaves of trees so attacked 
are crisp, and assume a swollen, crumpled, and 
succulent appearance ; the shoots themselves 
are affected by it in the same manner, and 
never produce either good blossom or healthy 
wood. It is probably occasioned by the 
sudden contraction or destruction of the ves- 
sels, and extravasation of the sap, when cold 
chilly winds and frosts immediately succeed 
warm sunshine, and soft genial weather ; in 
such case, the diseased shoots should be rubbed 
off where they can be spared ; where not, the 
tops should be pinched down to the healthy 
part, which is generally at their lower end ; 
and from the remaining eyes, fresh shoots will 
push in sufficient time to ripen perfectly. The 
curl principally attacks those sorts of the 
peach which have leaves deeply serrated and 
devoid of glands, and it probably proceeds in 
part from the same causes which occasion the 
blister, aided by the operation of drying winds. 
The leaves and tops of the shoots affected 
curl up and emit a saccharine secretion, which 
attracts the aphides; these, by extracting the 
juices of the leaves and shoots, destroy them, 
and the tree consequently perishes. Mulching 
round the stem of the tree, and keeping its 
head and the mulch n oist by watering, will 
act as a preventive, or restore it to its health. 
The insects should be destroyed by fumigation 
with tobacco, or by washing the tops of the 
shoots with tobacco water, or by sprinkling 
them with snuff after watering. — Gum. This 
complaint is of frequent occurrence, and pro- 
ceeds from a variety of causes ; and it is in 
most cases incurable. It may be distinguished 
in the early stages of its progress, by brown 
or rusty spots appearing on the young shoots, 
which frequently gum, and die off the same 
season : should they survive, in the following 
spring these spots becoming blotches, open

and bleed, the wound expands, and the virus 
gradually corrodes the adjoining parts, until 
it encircles the branch and destroys it. The 
cankered part, when cut transversely, exhibits 
the pith, alburnum, and rind, all tainted by 
the vitiated sap, which may be traced from 
the point where it takes its rise by its dis- 
coloured tint, to the wound whence it issues 
and forms gum ; it is rarely confined to a few 
parts, but circulates through and affects the 
whole system to the extremities. Gum is the 
consequence, either of the plant being propa- 
gated from a diseased stock ; or, if healthy 
originally, of the tree being planted in an un- 
suitable soil or situation ; old gardens long 
worked, exhausted of that freshness so con- 
genial to the peach, and saturated with acrid 
and corroding manures, rarely afford healthy 
peach trees ; cold clayey ground, retentive of 
moisture, and such as have a sour or ferru- 
ginous substratum, which chills and cankers 
the roots, are equally pernicious to the peach 
tree ; on such it generally throws out strong 
spongy and ill-ripened shoots during summer, 
which possessing a superabundance of crude 
watery juices, are frost-bitten in winter, and 
gum and perish the ensuing season. Cold raw 
summers, also, in which the mean heat is 
below the temperature necessary for the peach 
tree to elaborate its sap, or enable its vessels 
to perform their secretions perfectly, always 
tend to produce gum and canker in fruit trees. 
The disease also proceeds from wounds, or other 
external injuries, of which the peach tree is 
susceptible ; in all cases, except that of 
wounds, topical applications fail in producing 
any permanent good effect ; but where they 
are resorted to, the edges of the wound should 
be pared to the quick, all the carious parts 
cleaned out, and the whole covered with some 
durable composition, which will adhere and 
effectually exclude the air and moisture, in 
which, I believe, consists all the efficacy that 
any application can possess. One of the best, 
and most readily provided, is a mixture of tar 
and powdered charcoal, sufficiently fluid to be 
laid on with ease: perhaps as charcoal has 
been found a powerful antiseptic, it may have 
some effect in counteracting a tendency to 
putrefaction in the wound. The apricot, 
plum, and cherry, are also subject to gum ; 
to the first it frequently proves destructive, 
Tut to the others it is less injurious. — Canker. 
Of all the diseases to which fruit trees are 
subject, the most injurious is the canker. In 
the pear and apple, proceeding from the same 
causes as gum in the peach, it resembles it in 
its progress, and is equally fatal in its ter- 
mination. From the strong similitude their 
features present in common, we may consider 
them as diseases of the same class, though 
altered in their symptoms by the peculiar 



organization of the different plants, and the 
same remedies and precautions which have 
been prescribed in the one case are generally 
applicable in ihe other. The pear and apple, 
however, possess the advantage of having some 
varieties much hardier and less liable to canker 
than others ; these, though in general of in- 
ferior quality, may, in case of the failure of 
choice sorts, be grafted on them, and succeed 
perfectly well where the others would perish. 
Being of opinion that no small proportion of 
both gum and canker, which are unfortunately 
so widely extended, have proceeded from the 
trees having been incautiously propagated from 
diseased stocks, by which means many valuable 
varieties of fruit have been brought into un- 
deserved disrepute, I feel that I cannot too 
strongly impress on the mind of the cultivator 
the necessity that exists for his using the 
utmost precaution in the choice of scions for 
grafting or budding, and that none should be 
employed but such as are taken from trees 
perfectly healthy and free from these com- 
plaints, otherwise they will be most certainly 
transferred, and the diseases in that case per- 
petuated. Independent of any other cause, 
some sorts are, in consequence of their con- 
formation, diseased from the seed ; such, no 
skill or circumstances will ever render healthy. 
— Age. Old age, though not properly a disease 
in fruit trees, but the last stage of existence, 
which, in common with that of all other 
organized beings, contains the germ of decay 
in its bosom from its birth, yet, as it is acce- 
lerated by adventitious circumstances, so may 
it also be retarded by art. A tree though 
planted in the most favourable situation, and 
enjoying in youth the most perfect health, 
must, nevertheless, experience in time in- 
firmities proceeding, amongst other causes, 
from the increasing difficulty with which the. 
head draws its supplies of nourishment from 
the roots, as the distance between its ex- 
tremities becomes more lengthened, and its 
vessels become more rigid and obstructed ; but 
by grafting the young shoots on young stocks, 
these defects may in a great measure be done 
away, a new vigour imparted to it, and its ex- 
istence prolonged to an indefinite term, when 
compared with that of human life. — Letter by 
Mr. J. Robertson. 

[Although these remarks were made as long 
since as 1821, they contain many valuable 
suggestions applicable to the present day.] 

Growing Melons on open Borders. — 
About the middle of March, the seeds for the 
first out-door crop are sown, and placed in a 
cucumber or other frame, where there is a 
tolerable heat. They are potted and treated 
in the usual way, till the final planting out. 
The first or second week in May, I prepare a 
bed on a south or south-west border, by 



PAPERS ANI) PROCEEDINGS OF THE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

throwing out the mould one foot deep and 
four feet wide, filling up the trench to half its 
depth with the stems and leaves of any vege- 
tables that require clearing off from the 
quarters of the kitchen garden. The remain- 
ing half is made up with the exhausted linings 
of cucumber frames or pits, which I consider 
better for the roots of the plants to run in, 
than fresh dung from the stable-yard. The 
bed, when the materials are put in, has an 
elevation of one foot towards the back or wall 
side, and is firmly trodden down with the feet. 
The mould that was taken out is returned 
upon the bed to the depth of nine inches, and 
has a similar treatment, as regards treading. 
When the preparation is finished I set on 
hand-lights, four feet apart, along the centre 
of the bed, and plant a pot of plants under 
each light. Two or three plants will be suffi- 
cient for each light. When they are planted 
I give a good watering, and shut the lights 
close down, and let them remain so till the 
plants have nearly filled them, when they 
should be tilted up about two inches in front 
every fine day for a week or ten days. If 
the weather is dry and warm, I give gentle 
watering, but if dull or cold the plants 
are better without it. If the hand-lights hap- 
pen to have ventilators at top, they will be 
better calculated for the purpose ; these may 
be opened to give air, instead of lifting the 
light ; this will let the damp air escape, and 
prevent the sun's heat from scorching the tops 
of the vines and leaves, which is apt to be 
the case if they are suffered to remain in con- 
tact with damp air, when so exposed. When 
the plants have nearly reached the top of the 
lights, or appear to get crowded with vines, 
the lights should be raised up and the plants 
let to grow out, in the same manner as is prac- 
tised with Ridge Cucumbers. If the vines 
are very thick, a few of the weakest may be 
pinched off, and the top of each leading shoot 
or vine removed. No more pruning will be 
necessary for the season. Previously to the 
lights being raised, the bed should be covered 
over with a layer of short grass, or any dry 
litter that may be most convenient, to keep 
the vines and fruit clean. Setting the fruit 
at this season of the year is quite unnecessary. 
If the weather is hot and dry, frequent water- 
ings will be required ; but it will be better to 
give water in tolerable quantities once or 
twice a week, than oftener and in less quan- 
tity, for Melon plants are impatient of much 
moisture on their vines or leaves, being very 
apt to canker from it. To have handsome 
fruit, it will be necessary to thin them when 
they get to the size of walnuts, as they set 
very freely, often several dozens on a hill. 
The fruit will begin to ripen about the first 
week in August, and continue to be produced 



through that month and part of September. 
All waterings should terminate when the fruit 
begins to ripen, since the roots of the plants 
running amongst the decomposed vegetables 
will afford sufficient nourishment to the later 
fruits. To prolong the season, seeds may be 
sown three weeks later, and planted out by 
the same rule, and treated in every respect as 
above, till there is an appearance of frosty 
nights, when they may be protected by com- 
mon cucumber or melon-lights, as is done 
with the early crops. By this means tolerably 
good Melons may be had till the end of Octo- 
ber. The sorts grown by the above treatment 
were the Black Rocks, Scarlet Rocks, Green 
fleshed, Netted, and Early Cantaloup Me- 
lons. — Letter by Mr. W. Greemkields. 

[Much of the success of growing Melons 
out of doors must depend on the season, and 
the situation. In a fine sunny season, with 
the beds situated in a warm sheltered spot, 
very tolerable fruit will be obtained of the 
hardier sorts, by the method here described.] 

The Glycine or Wistaria sinensis. — 
The Glycine sinensis was first introduced to 
this country from China in 1816. In May of 
that year Captain Robert Welbank, then 
commanding the Cuffnells, East Indiaman, 
brought a plant of it with him from China, 
and gave it to Charles Hampden Turner, Esq., 
of Rooksnest, in Surrey, who kept it in the 
pot in which it arrived until 1819, when it 
first flowered. The blossoms show themselves 
before the leaves ; their first appearance is 
that of thick short pale green tufts, in which 
the buds of the flowers are enveloped by long 
pale hairy bracts, which fall off as the racemes 
advance. These when full-grown, are from 
eight to fifteen inches long, each bearing from 
eighty to a hundred flowers on an average ; 
they are pendent, and have much resemblance 
to those of a Laburnum, except that they are 
of a very delicate bluish lilac colour, with a 
very agreeable fragrance. In a conservatory, 
the blossoms expand in March, more or less 
early, according to the heat of the house. 
Against a south wall in the open air they first 
appear in the middle of April, and last nearly 
a month. Without the protection of a wall 
the opening of the flowers is in May, and their 
beauty continues till June. The plants fre- 
quently put out a small second crop of flowers 
on the young shoots of the year, immediately 
after the spring blossoming is past, but these 
are not so fine as the first crop of flowers, 
though they are darker in colour ; they are 
subject to drop off prematurely. In the 
autumn, another crop of blossoms is produced ; 
these come in August, and though not so abun- 
dant as the spring flowers, have an advantage 
in being mixed with the foliage. This autum- 
nal flowering does not appear in perfection on

the plants which are placed on walls, or under 
protection ; in such situations the racemes are 
produced as early as July, but as they expand, 
the flower buds fall off; being apparently 
unequal to sustain the heat to which they are 
exposed. The leaves are as beautiful in their 
way as the flowers ; they are nearly a foot in 
length, of a peculiarly delicate pale green, and 
elegantly pinnated. The plant does not re- 
quire any nicety of management; it is impa- 
tient of the knife, and succeeds best in good 
rich loam. The branches are of considerable 
length, and in a conservatory should be placed 
near the glass. When trained against a wall, 
it has been found that the branches which are 
carried horizontally, produce a greater abun- 
dance of flowers. When not placed on a wall, 
they require the support of a stake or trellis. 
The plant is readily propagated by laying the 
young green shoots in pots buried in the earth, 
and as these advance in growth, continuing 
to peg them down into fresh pots, leaving 
some eyes or buds above the ground ; and thus 
many plants may be obtained from a single 
branch. Cuttings both of the wood and of 
the roots, planted in loam, are said to succeed. 
I believe it has not yet borne ripe seed in this 
country, nor has any been brought from China.

[There is hardly a more beautiful hardy 
creeping plant than the Wistaria sinensis. 
Trained along the top of a wall, just beneath 
the coping, the wall being covered with orna- 
mental evergreen plants, its appearance when 
in bloom in the early part of May is most 
charming. It is a fine plant for ornamenting 
the fronts of cottages, or any other buildings. 
We have seen a single branch introduced with 
capital effect along the top of a span- roofed 
greenhouse.]

AND ORIGINAL NOTES CONNECTED WITH HORTICULTURE 
AND NATURAL HISTORY. 

Moss or Lichen on Fruit Trees. — Old 
orchard fruit trees, especially in situations 
where they do not grow kindly, are very apt 
to get the branches and trunks covered with 
lichen and moss, which does them injury. 
This moss and lichen may be cleared off in 
several ways, but one of the simplest, and a 
very effectual one, is to well dredge the trees 
when they are damp with gentle rains or heavy 
fogs, with dry wood ashes. If this is 
persevered in for a short time, the trees will 
be effectually cleared. 

Sloping Banks in Gardens. — Those who 
have small gardens and desire to make the 
most of them, may effect considerable gain by 
disposing of part of the surface in flat ridges, 
instead of making it level ; this plan also serves 
to protect and shelter the crops, and secures 



the advantage of various aspects. The ridges 
may be formed from eight to twelve feet wide 
at the base, according to the depth of good soil ; 
they should run east and west for the sake of 
securing a south (or early) and a north (or 
late) aspect ; the elevation of the ridges may 
be more or less according to the available 
depth of soil ; from two to three feet will be 
suitable. 

The Papaw Tree. — This tree, the Carica 
Papaya of botanists, fruits freely in the hot- 
houses of the Duke of Northumberland at Sion 
house. The fruit of this plant is used as an 
esculent, and when cooked is esteemed by 
some, but has little to recommend it. The 
tree itself has the very singular and hitherto 
unexplained property, of rendering animal 
substances tender, by causing a separation of 
the muscular fibre. Newly killed meat sus- 
pended among its leaves is said to become 
tender in a few hours. It forms a handsome 
tree, with large palmate leaves, and greenish 
coloured flowers, the sterile and fertile ones 
growing in separate bunches, the latter much 
larger than the former, and succeeded by good 
sized egg-shaped fruit. 

The Vesuvius-pippin Apple. — This apple 
was raised from some fruit obtained by A. 
Arcedeckne, Esq., from the Priory, on Mount 
Vesuvius ; it is called by the monks there the 
Mela Appia, and as it resembles a good deal 
the Lady Apple, or Pomme d'Api of the 
French, it has been supposed that the latter 
name is a corruption of the former. The fruit 
is small, oblong contracted beyond the middle ; 
the colour is yellow and bright red, and the 
skin glossy ; the flesh is crisp and juicy, sweet 
and slightly perfumed. It ripens and is in 
perfection in the middle of January, and will 
probably keep till April. 

Fertilizing Cucumbers. — It is not only 
unnecessary to fertilize the blossoms of cucum- 
bers, so far as the growing of fruit fit for 
table is concerned, but positively detrimental, 
where fine and symmetrical fruit are required, 
such as for exhibition. This admits of expla- 
nation. When the blossom is fertilized, the 
young ovules (future seeds) begin to form their 
embryo, and as all the ovules in the fruit are 
seldom or never influenced in this way, those 
which are influenced, when they begin to grow, 
cause the fruit to swell unequally, thus pro- 
ducing an unsymmetrical outline. But though 
the fruit, as an horticultural production, will 
come to maturity without the fertilization of 
the ovary having been effected, yet the seeds 
of such plants will be abortive ; consequently 
when fertile seed is required, it is necessary 
to have recourse to fertilization. In the case 
of unfertilized fruit, too, the blossom remains 
expanded much longer than when the ferti- 
lization lias been effected ; and this is a point

of importance to exhibitors. The object in 
growing cucumbers, whether for show or use, 
being not to produce seed, but long handsome 
fruit, it follows that the contact of the pollen 
with the stigma should be prevented, for in 
preventing this, we prevent the rapid decay of 
the flower, and take away the check to 
longitudinal extension, and the tendency to 
unequal lateral protuberation . — M. 

To destroy Aphides. — A very simple and 
effectual mode of killing aphides, where fumi- 
gation is objected to, is to syringe the plants 
thoroughly with a mixture of equal parts of 
clear lime and soot water, with one-sixth part 
of tobacco liquor added. A fine syringe should 
be used to apply it, as the object is to wet 
rather than wash every part of the plant. 
The dead aphides may afterwards be washed 
off with clear water. They may also be 
destroyed by using a solution of poly-sulphuret 
of calcium, obtained by boiling lime and flour 
of sulphur in water, and syringing the plants 
with the clear liquor. Both these methods 
are clean, which is a recommendation in con- 
servatoires and domestic greenhouses. 

The Chocolate Nut. — The chocolate nut 
tree (the obroma Cacao) has recently been 
fruited for the first time in England — proba- 
bly in Europe — in the garden of the Duke of 
Northumberland, at Sion house, Brentford. 
A ripe fruit was exhibited at a meeting of the 
Horticultural Society, on January 19, 1847. 
The fruit is oblong, pointed, and of a bright 
yellow colour, closely filled with large seeds, 
which, when roasted, form the pure cocoa of 
commerce. Whole forests are formed of this 
tree in Demerara. The plant at Sion is 
about four years old and seven feet high. 

Forcing Turnip-greens. — During the 
prevalence of frost, a good addition to the 
stock of vegetables may be made by placing 
some roots of turnips in a slight heat ; in a 
week or two they will afford a good cutting of 
greens. Where there is a vinery, or any other 
warm place at command, a quantity of the 
roots may be set close together. A cellar, 
where a little warmth can be given them, will 
do ; but in this case they will grow blanched. 
When so treated they afford two or three good 
cuttings, and the roots may be afterwards 
given to pigs or cattle. 

Planting out Camellias in Conserva- 
tories. — A most important point to be at- 
tended to in planting out Camellias — or indeed 
any other plants — is to take care that the roots 
are disengaged as much as possible, by break- 
ing the hard ball of earth around which the 
roots are usually matted. Thus the roots 
come in contact with the fresh soil, and strike 
out vigorously ; and the water which is ap- 
plied also reaches the centre of the roots. 
This disengagement of their roots is often 



secured by lifting the ball of earth and letting 
it fall heavily down, repeating this until it 
becomes loose. When they are planted out 
with the old balls of earth entire, the plants 
are likely to suffer, or perhaps die, for want of 
water, the latter not penetrating the hard soil, 
but passing off by the looser medium which 
surrounds it. 

Boots op the Scarlet-runner Bean. — 
The Scarlet-runner Bean (Phaseohcs multi- 
jiorus), produces long irregular tapering fleshy 
roots, somewhat resembling those of the marvel 
of Peru : these, if protected from frost by a 
bank of earth, will break out again in the 
spring, the plant being perennial. In this 
way they may be grown year after year with- 
out sowing fresh seeds. The roots, however, 
are poisonous, and must on no account be 
eaten. 

The Sweet Montmorency Cherry. — This 
is an American seedling, supposed to have 
been raised from the Montmorency cherry of 
the French, an early acid fruit. The fruit of 
this variety is borne in pairs ; it is small, 
nearly round, slightly flattened at the base, 
with a shallow suture on one side, and a dis- 
tinctly indented point at the end; the skin is 
on the sunny side, when mature, of a deep red, 
somewhat mottled and cloudy, and of a pale 
amber in the shade ; the stalk is rather slender, 
about three quarters of an inch long, inserted 
in a small shallow round hollow ; the flesh 
yellowish ; rich and sweet ; the stone small, 
The tree is of upright habit, with a smooth 
clean stem, strong shoots, and medium sized, 
dull green, wavy foliage. The fruit hangs 
well on the tree, and is eaten (in America) from 
July loth to August 5th. It is one of the 
latest sweet cherries. The fruit while growing 
is ordinary, and when ripening very bitter, 
but this passes away when allowed to hang till 
it is fully coloured and ripe. 

Manure for Hops. — Mr. J. C. Nesbit re- 
commends a manure composed of guano, gyp- 
sum, nitrate of soda, and common salt, as being 
best calculated to return to the soil the sub- 
stances extracted by the hop, thus enabling 
it to produce good crops. Trials which 
have been made with this mixture have proved 
to be successful. In one case the proportions 
of three cwt. of guano, one and a half cwt. of 
saltpetre, half a cwt. of gypsum, and one and 
a half cwt. of common salt, were applied, at a 
cost of 70.S. per acre, with great success. 

Propagation of Gloxinias. — These may 
be raised either from seeds, or by cuttings of the 
young shoots, or by leaves. The seeds should 
be sown in shallow pans of sandy soil, on a 
thin bed of silver sand, a little of which should 
afterwards be dusted over them. Place the 
pan in a brisk hot-bed, and cover it with 
a bell-glass until the seeds vegetate. The 



190 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



cuttings should be taken off when the young 
shoots are about three inches long ; plant them 
in silver sand, and set them in a hot-bed. 
Leaf propagation maybe done in two ways: — 
1. Insert the leaf in sand like a cutting, the 
base soon forms a knob, from which a bud is 
subsequently developed. 2. Cut the principal 
rib at the back of the leaf through with a knife 
in several places, an inch or more apart ; then 
press the leaf flat upon the sand, and place a 
few small stones on the top near the incisions, 
to keep it down flat; the ribs are to be placed 
downward; then cover with a bell-glass, and 
place in a brisk heat ; little knobs will be 
formed at the incisions, which in due time will 
put forth buds. Keep them all, while growing, 
in a warm moist atmosphere, and when their 
leaves are mature, allow them to become com- 
paratively dry, in which state they may be set 
away in a cool frame for a month or two ; after 
which they should be potted in fresh soil, of 
equal parts sandy peat and leaf-mould, set in 
a warm pit, and gradually watered until they 
are fairly started, when they must have plenty 
of heat, light, and water, and a little weak liquid 
manure once or twice a week. 

Veronica speciosa as a Standard. — This 
fine greenhouse plant is said to have a noble 
appearance when grown as a standard ; it is 
an excellent winter blooming plant. 

To prevent Iron from rusting. — M. Zeni 
states that iron, painted over twice with the 
following composition, and exposed daily for 
some time to the action of the sea, remained 
entirely free from rust : — With eighty parts of 
pounded and very finely sifted brick- dust, mix 
twenty parts of litharge ; this is then to be 
ground upon a slab with linseed oil, to the con- 
sistence of a thick paste, and then diluted with 
oil of turpentine. Before using, the iron 
should be rubbed quite clean. 

How to prune. — In pruning all kinds of 
plants the proper way of making the cut is 
thus : — With a sharp knife make one clean cut 
through the shoot, commencing on the opposite 
side from a bud, and bringing out the knife on 
the other side, close above the top of the bud, 
the cut forming a sloping wound with an 
angle of about 45 degrees. When growth 
commences such a wound as this is soon healed. 
It is wrong to cut so as to leave a snag above 
the terminal bud which is left; equally so to 
cut through to the level of the base of the bud, 
or nearly so ; and the common mode of making 
a long irregular cut, beginning much below 
the bud, and ending considerably above, is 
quite as bad, and even less workmanlike. 

Seedling Pelargoniums. — The quality of 
a flower, as regards its usefulness to the culti- 
vator, is never thoroughly ascertained under 
thi'ee years from the time of raising. Those 
qualities, indeed, which relate to " properties" 



may be regarded as settled the second season 
of blooming, but the grower has also to ascer- 
tain the capacity of the plant to answer his 
ends. Some varieties naturally bloom in their 
perfection early in the ordinary season, others 
late; and the grower for exhibition, who has to 
manage his plants so as to have them in per- 
fection at a fixed day, requires to know these, 
so that he may grow the early varieties for his 
earliest purposes, and reserve the later ones 
for the later shows. There are indeed some 
kinds that bloom tolerably well at any part of 
the season, but many others come out of 
character as it is called, when grown out of 
their proper season. 

Annuals. — Well grown Annuals contribute 
much to the gaiety of the garden; and although 
not quite so well adapted for masses as some 
of our half-hardy plants, yet they are extremely 
eligible for borders and mixed beds. They 
are frequently treated with too much kincl- 
ness, sown in soil of too rich a character, and, 
of course, " run too much to leaf." All those 
who who can spare the means, should devote 
two little frames to their especial cultivation 
during the early part of sjDring, the one with 
bottom-heat, the other without it. That with 
bottom-heat would be better with a plunging 
material, possessing a permanent heat of 70 
degrees, the pots placed very close to a clear 
glass roof, and matted up at night. The other 
frame, without bottom-heat, should be raised 
a foot above the ground level, where water 
cannot possibly stand, and should be filled to 
within a foot of the glass with cinder ashes. 
They should be both well watered with boil- 
ing water previous to placing the pots, to 
destroy all insects. Both the tender and 
hardy kinds are conveniently raised in the 
frame with heat ; managing the sowings in a 
successive way, according to the period in 
which they are required to blossom. The 
hardy, however, would have to be removed to 
the cold frame as soon as an inch high ; they 
would there harden down in a couple of weeks, 
and be ready for turning out into the borders. 
The tender annuals, if in the warm frame 
they are being drawn up weakly, might be re- 
moved to warm and light shelves in the green- 
house or other structures. The soil for the 
hardy kinds should be chiefly plain loam ; this 
will be found to produce a sturdier plant than 
rich vegetable matters, and much blossom, in 
proportion to the amount of foliage. AIL 
hardj' annuals are best raised in pots through 
the summer, in cool frames, turning them out 
when slightly pot-bound. How often are 
annuals seen in rich borders, of immense 
size, yet contributing little to the decoration 
of the garden, from their paucity of flowers ; 
and in a wet and dull summer actually rottin^ 
in the ground j — Q.C.

Incrustations in- hot water Apparatus. 
— Notwithstanding that clear soft water only 
may be used in filling an hot water apparatus, 
yet more or less of sediment, and of a hard 
slaty substance will become deposited within a 
few months ; and where less attention is paid 
to the nature of the water employed, the 
deposits will be greater in proportion. To 
prevent this sal ammoniac (or muriate of am- 
monia) should be mixed with the water, at 
the rate of about an ounce to ninety gallons of 
water. 

Rose Forcing. — Provins and Moss Roses 
may be forced annually with the utmost suc- 
cess, without giving them a season of rest. 
The plants are introduced into heat (a shelf 
near the glass in a vinery will do) in succes- 
sion, and as soon as the most forward flowers 
have fully expanded, they are removed to a 
greenhouse stage to display their beauty, and 
to ripen their wood. About the middle or 
end of May, the pots are fully exposed to the 
open air, plunged to the rim in coal-ashes. 
Nothing more is required until the first week 
in October, when the same season's growths 
are to be pruned in to two buds, and the plants 
placed in a shed for a week, to moderately dry 
the soil previous to re- potting them. Then 
the ball is turned out and the soil shaken from 
the roots, the strongest pruned in, but all that 
are fibrous retained. The plants are then re- 
potted in the same sized pots (9-inch), using 
a mixture of two parts strong loam, two parts 
well decomposed cow-dung, and one part rotten 
leaf mould ; and placed under a green-house 
stage, until required for forcing. — G.C 

Oncidium unguiculatum. — This new yel- 
low-flowered oncid is one of the best which 
our gardens contain. It is a strong growing 
species, flow r ering freely; it blooms during the 
winter season ; and the blossoms remain in a 
fresh state for an incredible length of time. 
It was first flowered in August 1846, by 
C. B. Warner, Esq., whose gardener writes 
(Jan. 19) — " It has now on it forty open blos- 
soms, and is likely to continue in blossom for 
another month; it has never had less than 
forty flowers on it since October, and would 
have had many more had not several branches 
been cut for bouquets, for which it is most 
useful. If cut at an early stage of its flower- 
ing it will send out lateral flowering branches 
at the base of those which have been removed. 
As to winter decoration it holds the first rank 
in the orchid house, on account of its beauty 
and the length of time it continues in bloom." 
We can confirm this from our own experience, 
having observed the same individual blossoms 
to last for two or three months. 

Mulberry Trees and Silkworms. — Mrs. 
Whitby, of Newlands, in Hants, has, during the 
last ten years, been directing her attention to 



the rearing of silkworms, with a view to their 
produce, and with considerable success. In 
1836 she procured a number of plants of the 
mulberry of the Philippine Islands (Morns 
alhus, var. multicauUs); she also bought silk- 
worms' eggs at Novi, which is said to produce 
the finest silk in Italy. Some difficulty was 
experienced in winding off the cocoons, and in 
1844, a person acquainted with the process 
was engaged from France, and the result had 
been highly satisfactory in the production of 
silk fit for the loom. At the same time she 
learnt how to treat the mulberry plants : cut- 
tings put into a cucumber frame with a slight 
heat, in October, 1844, and thence transplanted 
into the open ground in the following spring, 
in two years yielded on an average ten cuttings 
each plant, two pounds weight of leaves having 
previously been gathered from each for feeding 
the silkworms. One acre of land planted with 
2,400 mulberry plants will, at the end of two 
years, yield from 20,000 to 24,000 cuttings. 
In 1846 Mrs. Whitby made some experiments 
to ascertain the relative value of eggs procured 
front four different places, and the following is 
the comparative weight and number of cocoons 
produced, all the worms being treated in every 
respect alike.

The Bengal cocoons were very inferior to the 
others. Mrg. Whitby finally showed how the 
English grower could compete with the Bengal 
grower, the latter having four crops, and the 
former only one annually; one cocoon reared 
in Englrnd being equal in weight to four of 
the Bengal; and the raw silk selling at from 23*. 
to 25s. per lb., while the Bengal raw silk 
fetches only from 10s. to lis. per lb. 

Cocoa Disease. — According to the Jamaica 
papers the cocoa of that country, presumed to 
be the Caladhim esculentum- (or Colocasia 
escidenta), is destroyed by a disease similar to 
that of the potato. The Cocoa, or Syre, grows 
from three to seven feet high, and consists ol 
the leaves, the heart, and the fingers, or tubers. 
The disease attacks the head first, the heart of 
which is converted to a black pulp, and at 
length becomes a hollow tube ; the leaves then 
droop and die, and the growth of the fingers, 
or eatable part, stops. There is no peculiarity 
of soil or aspect exempt from destruction ; 
and on examination either of the soil or the 
plant nothing can be discovered to lead in the 
remotest degree to the cause of the disease. 

Strawberries. — The following is an out-

line of a very successful practice : — Secure 
well rooted early runners ; plant tliera two feet 
apart, in deep, rich, loamy soil, in an open part 
of the garden ; constantly remove the runners, 
to strengthen the central crown or heart, which 
thus attains a large size, being fed by strong, 
healthy leaves. This crown, in the fruiting 
season, throws out many flower stems, which 
are vigorous, and bear numerous blossoms, 
which set freely, and ripen off" a good crop of 
large fruit, which from being fully exposed to 
sun and air, acquire a superior flavour. 

Hexangular flowered Camellias. — 
The Chinese possess Camellias of various 
colour, which produce hexangular -shaped 
blossoms ; these varieties are highly prized by 
them. Every attempt, however, to introduce 
them to this country has hitherto been in- 
effectual ; the plants always proving to be like 
our imbricata. Mr. Fortune, the collector of 
the Horticultural Society, when in China, again 
attempted it, and sent over several, one pre- 
sented to him, the others purchased when in 
bloom ; the former plant has bloomed, and 
proves, as before, to be like imbricata ; none 
of the latter are likely to flower this season ; 
but on an old plant of imbricata. growing in 
the garden of the Society, a bloom having the 
hexangular character in a decided manner has 
been produced. As the Chinese are so 
famous for stunting and starving their plants, 
does not this indicate that cultivation has 
something to do with the matter ? 

Epiphyllums. — These are the flat-stemmed 
Cactuses. To grow and flower them success- 
fully, adopt the following method : — Cut away 
the least desirable of the old shoots, and if the 
plants are large, some of the weakest of the 
young ones also ; this is to be done after 
flowering is past in the spring. They should 
then be repotted into a compost of free loam, 
with sharp gritty sand and small lumps of 
charcoal intermixed, and used in sufficient 
quantity to render the compost porous. Place 
them into a hothouse, or warm pit, where there 
is plenty of air, or else in a warm greenhouse, 
or a warm place at the window, and let them 
have air freely. Keep them all this time well 
watered, occasionally applying weak manure 
water. When the shoots have reached their 
full size, or nearly so, begin to reduce the 
quantity of water, and when the shoots feel 
firm, and have done growing, set them out in 
a hot place exposed to sun, but protected from 
wet. Plants thus ripened, will always flower 
well ; they require to be kept moderately dry 
until they come into flower ; and can be forced 
or retarded so as to produce their flowers in 
succession during winter, spring, and the early 
part of summer. 

Black Italian Poplar. — This tree, (the 



Populus monilifera,) though not possessing 
any remarkable beauty in its habit, has yet the 
property of quickness of growth which renders 
it very desirable in some situations. For in- 
stance, in the neighbourhood of cities and 
manufacturing towns, where the mansions and 
gardens of wealthy proprietors are sometimes 
necessarily near to buildings, and other un- 
sightly objects, such as mills, tall chimneys, 
&c, there is no tree which will so quickly 
grow up to form a screen as this kind of poplar. 
In good soil, where there is also a fair degree 
of moisture, it will produce shoots of five or 
six feet in length annually, and thus, in four or 
five years, will have reached from twenty to 
thirty feet in height. In this way it soon sup- 
plies shade and shelter to the suburban resi- 
dent, and also concealment from the intrusive 
gaze of surrounding neighbours, or hiding or 
shutting out from view unsightly objects of 
whatever kind. 

Grafting Roses. — In grafting roses, which 
is best done before the shoots begin to grow in 
spring, the following is found to be a very 
successful plan: — Select the stocks of such 
dwarf roses as were budded the previous year, 
and in which the buds have failed, or, wanting 
these, take small well-rooted and established 
stocks of any free-growing kind, such as the 
common dog-rose, than which there is none 
superior for the purpose. Clear away the soil 
from the stem, so that the graft may be below 
the surface of the ground ; and cut off the top 
of the stock, with a sloping clean cut, as low 
as will admit of the graft being so placed. Put 
on the grafts by a mode similar to common 
whip-grafting, but on the highest side of the 
stock ; a second tongue is to be formed of the 
bark of the graft, with a very thin piece of 
wood, and this should be long enough to cover 
the sloping cut, and fit even with the bark on 
the lowest side. The scion is then to be tied 
on carefully, and, as is usual, the bark of stock 
and graft kept quite even on one side. Clay 
or grafting wax is then to be put securely 
round, and well closed at top and bottom, and 
the soil is then to be drawn again up to the 
plants, so as to cover the clay, leaving the top 
of the graft exposed. If in the open ground, 
they are now left to their fate, being merely 
kept clear of weeds ; but if in pots, should be 
set into a cool frame, and duly watered. By 
this neat way of grafting much better plants 
are obtained than by the ordinary mode, as 
the second tongue takes firm hold of the top 
of the stock, and a clean and perfect union 
takes place. Grafting is not so desirable a 
mode of propagating roses as budding ; but 
the plan here given is applicable to other 
plants, and is much the best way of grafting 
anything at all delicate. 



STOVE AND GREENHOUSE AQUATICS.

CULTURE OF STOVE AND GREENHOUSE AQUATIC PLANTS. 



How seldom do we meet with an aquarium, 
that is, a horticultural structure devoted princi- 
pally, if not exclusively, to the growth of 
aquatic plants! And yet this cannot be be- 
cause such plants are less beautiful than 
•others, for they comprise some of nature's 
choicest subjects ; neither can it be that there 
is any insuperable barrier as respects the faci- 
lity with which they may be cultivated, for 
there are many plants of far more difficult 
culture brought to the very zenith of perfec- 
tion. Probably the cause is, that an aquarium 
is too monotonous, too unmanageable ; in 
other words, there may be too much difficulty 
in keeping up that variety and change which 
it is possible to secure with other classes of 
plants. However this may be, nothing can 
be more certain than this, that aquatic plants 
are not of difficult culture, whatever difficulty 
48. 



there may be in managing to keep up a con- 
tinual succession of bloom from them alone. 

There are two ways in which aquatic plants 
are, and may be, grown. The one is in 
structures or houses, devoted to them solely, 
or, at least, chiefly. The other is to grow 
them in tubs, pans, or pots, proportioned to 
their size, and set in some appropriate struc- 
ture according to the temperature they require. 
The latter plan is most generally adopted, 
because then a separate house is not required; 
and they are more readily put away during 
their dormant season. This plan, however, 
does nothing towards extending the culture of 
these plants, by endeavouring to overcome the 
supposed difficulties of exciting continued 
interest by them alone, inasmuch as the plants 
are just set to grow once a year according to 
their nature and habits, and they grow, and 
o

flower, — perhaps — and then sink again into 
their annual repose. 

When the practice of growing them among 
other plants is adopted, they are planted in 
pans or tubs of suitable size, in proper soil, 
the vessels being supplied with water as may 
be necessary, and set either in the stove or 
greenhouse, according as the plants may indi- 
vidually require more or less of heat. The 
stove species, which mostly require the tem- 
perature of the water to be raised, should be 
placed over the flues, pipes, or other heating 
apparatus. 

It will not be necessary further to enlarge on 
the culture under this head, as the notes which 
occur in a subsequent part of this article, in 
reference to each genus, will supply what other 
information may be requisite. 



By far the most complete mode of culture 
is, however, to devote separate structures to 
this particular class of plants, perhaps includ- 
ing some that will bear the same general 
treatment. These structures may be of any 
size that may be determined as suitable to the 
extent of the collection of plants which it is 
intended to cultivate ; and although, as just 
remarked, they may not necessarily be entirely 
occupied with water plants; yet, for the sake 
of maintaining the feature of a collection of 
aquatics, the latter should predominate. Thus, 
the side benches might be occupied with 
a variety of plants not strictly aquatic, but 
which grow in wet boggy places, and, con- 
sequently, would thrive in the moist atmo- 
sphere that would of necessity be kept up. 

The annexed sketch represents a simple, 




though convenient, as well as appropriate, 
house for these plants. The centre should be 
occupied by a tank as large as the space would 
admit, to contain the larger growing plants ; 
in fact, such a tank would take the bulk of 
the collection. It should be elevated about a 
foot above the floor, so that the water may be 
sufficiently under the eye to show the smaller 
plants to advantage, while the larger ones are 
brought nearer the level of the eye. The 
water in this tank should be kept at a tempe- 
rature of from 70 to 80 degrees, by means of 
a hot water pipe passing through it, the higher 
temperature being most proper for the period 
of vigorous growth. The bottom of this tank 
should communicate with a drain, so that it 
might be partially or entirely emptied when 
necessary. A walk should pass entirely 
around this tank, of sufficient width to admit 
of ladies passing without inconveniencing their 
dresses; for very much of the enjoyment of 
flowers, as well as of other sights, depends on 
the comfort and facility with which they may 
be inspected ; and no lady would care to pass 
round a narrow confined passage, where her 
dress would be liable to wipe the damp side- 
wall of the tank ; this may appear a trifling 
thing to notice in this place, but it is certainly 
of more importance than at first sight seems 
to attach to it. The path may be of stone, 
slate, grave!, or it may be of lattice work ; the 



latter is ever preferable, as it admits of keep- 
ing the floor quite moist, without having a wet 
surface to walk on ; however, this may be 
regulated entirely by choice. The sides of 
the house, as well as the ends, should be occu- 
pied by stone benches, made so as to hold six 
or eight inches of water, also warmed by 
means of a pipe passing along them ; in this 
water, the smaller and more delicate aquatic 
plants, being planted in pots or pans, should 
be set, either entirely immersed, or partially 
elevated, so as to suit their respective wants ; 
and almost entirely elevated above its surface 
may be set the pans or pots containing such 
bog or swamp plants as may not require to be 
actually placed in the water, but which are 
benefited by being just so placed, as that 
their roots may obtain a constant supply of 
moisture by capillary attraction. These 
benches ought to be divided into compart- 
ments, so that some parts may, if requisite, be 
kept dry, to afford standing room for any 
plants which the atmospheric conditions of 
this house may be suitable for, but which do 
not require to be quite so bountifully supplied 
with moisture at the root. The atmospheric 
temperature of the house may be kept up by 
means of hot water pipes ; what that tempe- 
rature should be is only to be determined 
when the class of plants to be cultivated has 
been definitively settled ; thus, if the stove 



STOVE AND GREENHOUSE AQUATICS.

species, such as Nelumbium, are to be grown, 
a regular stove heat must be kept up during 
the growing season ; 75 or 80 degrees will then 
not be too much for most of these plants, but 
this heat is not requisite while they are rest- 
ing, any more than it would be with other 
stove plants. It is for this class of plants, 
too, that the warming of the Avater is particu- 
larly desirable. The ordinary greenhouse 
species require little artificial atmospheric 
heat, neither is it at all necessary that the 
water should be warmed for them. If, as 
most probably would be the case, a mixed 
general collection is to be grown, the extreme 
heat that would best suit the stove kinds, as 
well as the coolness proper for those of tem- 
perate climes, must alike give place to a 
mean temperature that will suffice to grow 
both to tolerable perfection ; when such a 
collection is to be cultivated, a temperature of 
70 degrees, as a maximum by natural or sun 
heat, and 60 degrees maximum by artificial 
or applied heat, will be enough; and this maybe 
allowed to fall several — six or eight — degrees 
at night. The water, in this case, may be 
warmed to about 60 degrees during the grow- 
ing period, and need not receive any artificial 
warming when the plants are at rest. 

In the sketch which is here given, provi- 
sion is made for accommodating a considerable 
number of the smaller growing species on 
the side benches. When, however, these are 
less cared for than the larger and more showy 
kinds, it would be more desirable to do away 
with the side benches, except, perhaps, at the 
ends of the house, and extend the tank in 
the centre, as far as practicable, on each side, 
the walk then passing close to the outside ; if 
this plan is followed, the upright glass of the 
sides should, for the sake of effect, extend 
down to the level of the path ; and this part 
of the house must also be a trifle more ele- 
vated in order to give head-room. If the 
side benches were done away, there would 
be abundant facility for growing any of the 
smaller kinds by suspending the pots in which 
their roots are planted, at a proper depth in 
the water, by means of metal hooks from 
the wall of the tank, so that there is no good 
reason why this arrangement should not, in 
all cases, be adopted, if preferred. The prin- 
cipal argument in favour of the side benches 
is this, that the water may be drained away, 
and the benches then used for other plants 
(not aquatics), for which the temperature of 
the house may happen to be suitable. 

The great point in growing aquatic plants 
successfully — at least the stove species, which 
are the most remarkable— is the maintaining 
of a proper and regular warmth in the water 
in which they are placed. They are often 
placed in tanks or cisterns, from which water 



is taken for the various purposes of watering 
plants (probably in other houses), syringing, 
sprinkling, &c, and when this is the case, 
and the deficiency so caused is made good by 
adding large quantities of cold water, the 
roots are subjected to continual chills ; and 
under these circumstances the plants never 
attain that perfection of which they are capa- 
ble ; many refuse even to grow so far as to 
produce flowers, but merely drag on a linger- 
ing puny existence. This, therefore, must 
be particularly avoided. A change of the 
body of water is indeed sometimes desirable, 
but this must be effected by supplying water 
less differing in temperature than ordinary 
cold water, from that which has been taken 
away ; this may be done by procuring it from 
a reserve cistern placed within the influence 
of the warmth from the heating apparatus. 

As water is the chief element supplied to 
these plants, it must be regarded as a matter 
of some importance from what source it is 
obtained. Rain water is best for all plants, 
aquatics included ; and when this is not to be 
had, pond or river water is next to be pre- 
ferred. Spring or well water is the very worst 
for horticultural purposes, unless previously 
to being used it is well aerated ; that is, ex- 
posed in shallow vessels to the sun and air. 
But though rain water is desirable, it must 
not run from the roof of the house into the 
tank where the plants are growing, as in 
some cases — though not always — this would 
be a worse evil than the one previously refer- 
red to, of filling up with cold water. The 
evil in this case would be principally felt in 
the early spring months, when the rain is 
often " cold," — sometimes mere melted snow 
— and the plants are making young growth. 

The plants should all be placed in pots, or 
pans, or tubs, for the convenience of removing 
them, and altering their arrangement and 
position with facility, and also for the purpose 
of facilitating their removal out of the water 
when in a dormant state. The floating species 
often increase very rapidly, and soon spread 
over a larger space than would be properly 
devoted to them individually; when this is the 
case, the plants must be kept within proper 
limits, by cutting away such parts as may have 
extended too far. In doing this it is necessary 
to observe that the extreme points of the shoots 
of many kinds are the most vigorous parts, 
and the root-stock the weakest; and when this 
is the case, too much of the extreme parts of 
the plant ought not to be cut away, but some 
parts thinned out, leaving the others at full 
length, or nearly so ; unless this is attended to, 
the strongest and best flowers, and the parts 
most likely to produce them, will be cut away, 
or perhaps the whole may be removed. So in 
the case of propasrating those which require 
" 2 



IDG

frequent renewal ; the youngest parts are the 
most vigorous, and absorb all the strength of 
the plant, and if the old plants are pruned 
close back, trusting to the old root -stock to 
send forth fresh shoots and leaves, they gene- 
rally grow but weakly, and sometimes will die 
away altogether. Some of the vigorous-root- 
ing points of the shoots should, therefore, in 
these cases be placed in pots, and they will 
form good plants ; this applies to providing 
plants at the end of one season, for blooming 
during the following one. 

The details of the kind of treatment re- 
quired by these plants will be best understood 
by describing rather minutely the most suc- 
cessful practice in cultivating some of the 
kinds ; for example the Nymjmceas, and .ZVe- 
himbium speciosum. One mode of culture, 
practised by Mr. C. Duff at Eaton Hall, and 
described by him in the Transactions of the 
Horticultural Society, was as follows : — In 
December, when the leaves were decayed, the 
bulbs or tubers of Nyv/vphcea rubra were 
taken out of the stone cisterns in which they 
had been growing for years, and were put into 
pots according to their size, the pots being 
plunged in water to within an inch of their 
rim; they remained in this situation in the 
pine stove till the plants began to show leaves 
in the April or May following ; they were then 
planted in cisterns and in glazed earthenware 
pots, in which were the following soils ; in the 
bottom four inches of strong clay made solid, 
above this six inches of light mellow loam, 
and at top an inch or two of sand to keep the 
water clean. The cisterns were of Yorkshire 
flags, and were of the following dimensions — 
three feet long, one foot eight inches broad, 
and one foot four inches deep ; they were 
placed upon the end flues of the pine pits, 
where the fire entered and escaped, and they 
were elevated with bricks to within eight or 
twelve inches of the glass. The glazed pots 
were from fourteen to eighteen inches in 
breadth and depth, and were similarly placed, 
except a few that were plunged in the corners 
of the melon pits ; they were kept constantly 
full of water, and it frequently was made to 
run over, in order that the water might be 
kept pure.^The temperature of the pits was 
seldom under 80°, and in sunshine often above 
100° Fahrenheit ; no air was admitted at the 
lights immediately above the plants. As the 
plants increased in growth they put out many 
runners, which were pinched off close to the 
tubers ; when the roots reached the clay the 
leaves got very strong, raising themselves on 
the sides of the cisterns. Under the same 
treatment Nymphcea ccerulea, and N. odorata 
flowered freely, and Nelumbium speciosum, in 
.1 glazed pot, plunged in leaves in the same pit, 
flowered abundantly, and ripened seed. 



The Nymphasas, with the exception of N. 
stellata, which is better treated like an annual, 
die down after flowering, and form bulbs or 
tubers in the soil ; in the autumn these should 
be examined, the smaller ones removed, and 
the larger ones planted singly for flowering. 

The Nelumbium speciosum was formerly 
very successfully grown by the late Mr. Kent 
of Clapton ; his plan was to raise the plants 
annually from seeds — which, by the by, have 
been known to grow when kept for sixty years 
— and to grow them in large tubs, with a few 
inches depth of water over the surface of the 
mould, placed in the tan-bed of the stove. The 
seed should be sown in March or April ; it is 
prepared for the operation by filing a small 
hole in the shell, at the end opposite the point; 
it is then to be put into a basin of water kept 
warm, and will have made a leaf in about ten 
days, when it may be removed to the situation 
where it is to flower. Some cultivators re- 
commend the houses to be left open at night 
(the night temperature of hot-houses should 
always be kept cooler than by day) when the 
weather is not cold; and towards the middle 
of September to remove the plants to the open 
air, and allow them to stand there till the 
following spring. Another cultivator, the late 
Mr. Stew r art of Valleyfield, adopted a very 
different course to that generally followed, with 
good success, which affords another proof of 
the fact which those familiar with the manage- 
ment of plants often have occasion to observe, 
namely, that the successful culture of plants is 
by no means constricted within the narrow 
limits of a single routine course of treatment; 
in other words, there is more than one success- 
ful way of growing most, if not all plants, 
provided certain principles are kept sight of. 
Mr. Stewart's plan was to grow them in a tub, 
plunged in the corner of a pine pit, in a tem- 
perature during summer from 65 to 90, or even 
100 degrees, but in winter seldom above 60 de- 
grees. During winter the plants received little 
water, the supply being gradually diminished 
from the time of flowering until they became 
almost dry, in which state they remained 
during winter ; in spring, the amount of water 
was increased, and as soon as the foliage had 
grown above the surface, the old earth was 
carefully removed from the roots, and replaced 
with strong rich loam. After this the tub 
was kept nearly full of water, to allow the 
leaves to float, and was thus maintained until 
they had risen eighteen or twenty inches in 
height ; the water was then reduced by allow- 
ing it gradually to escape through the staves of 
the tubs, the top hoop being purposely slack- 
ened, until it was lowered nearly to the surface 
of the mould. Fresh water was supplied 
every evening, and allowed thus to drain off 
during the growth and flowering of the plants ; 



STOVE AND GREENHOUSE AQUATICS.

and as the leaves and flowers died away 
gradually, so was the water reduced till the 
tub became nearly dry. 

* All the larger growing kinds require treat- 
ment similar to that here detailed of the 
Nymphasas and Nelumbium ; but the true 
stove species are much more difficult to cul- 
tivate than those kinds which only require 
a greenhouse, chiefly in consequence of the 
degree of heat which it is essential should be 
kept up at the roots, while they are growing; 
this ought never to be below 70 degrees, and 
even 80 and 90 degrees may be given them 
with advantage; but this treatment must not 
be incessant, it is during their growing season 
only that they require this degree of heat; 
while they are dormant they should be kept 
much cooler, and nearly or quite dry. Suffi- 
ciently frequent changes of the water, to keep 
it sweet and pure, are essential to success. The 
smaller kinds require treatment similar to the 
larger ones, only adapted to their size. 

Attempts have been made to grow some of 
the tender species in reservoirs of water in the 
open air, but warmed to a comfortable tem- 
perature for the roots ; and in some instances 
this has been successful. There is no doubt, 
that all these plants would thrive very well in 
a structure where the water was kept at a 
tolerable degree of heat, and the atmosphere 
of an intermediate temperature. Where there 
are divisions in the cistern — as there should 
be — the water in some should be warmed for 
the more tender kinds, and others either much 
less heated, or not at all, to suit the hardier 
kinds. Under this arrangement, even some of 
the perfectly hardy ones might be introduced 
among the tender ones, so as to render a 
collection more perfect and complete, and the 
house better filled with this particular class of 
plants ; and if the water in which they were 
placed were not heated, they would accommo- 
date themselves to their situation, so as not to 
suffer injury from the increased temperature 
of the atmosphere. In one of the cases where 
tender aquatics have been successfully grown 
out of doors, in cisterns of heated water, the 
plants experimented on were Nymphcea c&ru- 
lea and Limnocharis Humboldtii ; some of 
the plants had their roots enveloped by a lump 
of clay, and were just thrown into the water ; 
others were sunk in small baskets filled with 
clay ; the reservoir being puddled with clay 
at the bottom, the roots in both cases soon 
reached it and established themselves ; this 
was in May. For some weeks they did not grow 
at all, but by the middle of June the Limno- 
charis flowered, and the flowers continued to 
increase in number; by the middle of July 
one of the Nymphajas flowered ; another plant 
scarcely made any progress : the weather was 
cold. Early in August the Limnocharis 



covered four or five square yards, and by the 
middle of September it had covered at least 
sixty yards, and had five hundred flowers open 
in one day; this number was actually counted. 
The flowers of the Nymphasa lasted several 
days, while in the stove they last but one. 
For two months after the plants were 
placed in the reservoirs, the heat of the water 
varied at the surface from 60 to 100 degrees, 
and sometimes appeared uncomfortably hot for 
the plants, (it should be explained that this 
water proceeded from the engine-house of a 
factory) ; but an alteration was made in the 
conducting troughs, and the water was cooled 
15 or 20 degrees, and they then appeared to 
thrive better, and it was just after this that 
the Nymphsea first flowered. The Limno- 
charis continued to bloom till the end of Octo- 
ber. "What a fine object would be presented 
by a large sheet of water adorned with the 
flowers of Nymphcea ccerulea, rubra, rosea, 
pubescens, and Lotus. Who know r s, too, 
but that the splendid Nelumbium speciosum 
and luteum would succeed under this treat- 
ment ; while certainly the magnificent-leaved 
Euryale ferox would here find that room, 
which, although requisite to its perfection, it 
seldom meets with in our stoves." This latter 
remark still more forcibly applies to the Vic- 
toria regia.

does well in a light loamy soil, the pots 
half covered with water ; it is propagated 
by seeds. 

Cyperus. — This is a genus of sub-aquatic 
plants, of a reed or sedge-like habit ; it con- 
tains both stove and greenhouse species, natives 
of various countries. They form the type of 
the natural order Cyperaceaaj their culture is 
simple, requiring loamy soil and moderately 
large pots, set a little under water : they are 
propagated by division. 

JDamasonlum. — There are two species. D. 
indicum (Indian) is a herbaceous perennial of 
floating habit, with large broad heart-shaped

abundance of seeds (spores) ; these fruitful 
fronds appear to be cut into narrower segments 
than the others, by the rolling under of their 
edges. It is a native of the East Indies, at 
Tranquebar ; and belongs to the natural order 
Polypodiaceas. It should be grown in a large 
pot of loamy soil, and set in shallow water ; 
or, what answers the same end, the bottom 
hole of the pot may be closed up with a lump 
of clay, and the top of the soil kept below the 
rim of the pot, so that the surface may be 



kept just flooded. It is propagated by seeds, 
or viviparous shoots, or by division of the 
plant. 

El odea. — Two stove species. E. gnaianentds 
(Guianan) is a small annual plant with white

Limnocharis comprises two handsome spe- 
cies. L. Humboldtii (Humboldt's) is a stove 
perennial, with floating, roundish, ovate leaves, 
and large primrose- coloured flowers of three 
obtuse petals, standing one on each stalk just 
above the water, and produced freely all the 
summer ; a native of Buenos Ayres, and 
succeeds in a cool stove or greenhouse. L. 
JPlumieri (Plumier's) has blunt oblong leaves, 
and bears umbels of pale yellow flowers 
throughout the summer and autumn ; it grows 



a foot and a half high, and is a native of 
Brazil. They belong to the natural order 
Butomaceas. They require to be put in pots 
of moderately large size, in rich loamy soil,

order Iridacese. It should be potted in peat 
and loam, and the pots half immersed : in- 
creased by division of the plant. 

Nelumbium. — The species of Nelumbium 
are splendid stove herbaceous perennials, with 
the habit of the water-lilies. N. speciosum 
(Sacred Bean of Pythagoras) has large peltate 
leaves, some of which float on the water, and 
others rise up three feet above it ; the flowers 
are rose-coloured, smelling of anise ; they rise 
above the leaves, and are produced from June 
to August : there are varieties whose flowers 
are white, and of intermediate tints : one 
variety called caspieum is from the mouth of 
the river Volga, in Astracan, and has pink 
flowers ; another called Tamara (Tamara, 
native name), from Malabar, also has pink 
flowers: the species is a native of the East 
and West Indies, China, Japan, and other 
places. Both seeds and roots are esculent 
and wholesome. N. luteum (yellow flowered), 
from Carolina and other parts of North Ame- 
rica, has yellow blossoms. N. jamaicense 
(Jamaica) has pale rose-coloured flowers, and 
is from Jamaica. N. tibetianum (Thibet) is 
recorded in Loudon's Magazine as having 
smaller, darker, and rounder flowers than 
those of N. speciosicm, but otherwise resem- 
bles that plant. They belong to the natural 
order Nelumbiaceas. They require to be 
grown in cisteras, or large pots or tubs, in 
rich loamy soil or mud ; to be kept dry in 
winter, and to have the depth of the water 
increased as they grow, so that when estab- 
lished they may have it from two to three 
feet deep ; they also require strong heat : 
propagated by seeds which should be sown in 
a temperature of 85 degrees, or by division. 

Neptunia (Water Sensitive). — There are 
four species introduced. N. natans (floating) 
grows two feet high, with bipinnate leaves, 
and ovate spikes of yellow flowers, produced 
from July to September : it is an annual 
stove plant, native of the East Indies and 
Cochin-China. JSf. plena (double) grows 
two or three feet high, with bipinnate leaves, 
and oval spikes of yellow flowers from July

ment to the Nelumbiums. 

Oryza sativa (Rice plant), is an erect 
plant, growing four or five feet high, with 
long narrow leaves, and an elegant panicle of 
ineouspieuou- flowers, followed by the heavy 



seeds. A native of the East Indies ; and 
belongs to the natural order Graminaceas. 
They should be sown in a pan or cistern of 
water, with a layer of loamy soil at the 
bottom : propagated by seeds. There are two 
other species.

peaty soil, and immersed in shallow water ; 
increased by division of the roots. 

Papyrus Antiqiiovum (ancient), is a peren- 
nial plant, with erect stems, six to ten feet 
high, clothed at the bottom with hollow sword- 
shaped leaves, and bearing at the top a dense 
umbel of narrow leaves, remarkable for nothing 
but the manner in which they are produced ; 
a native of Ethiopia and Egypt. The ancients 
made their paper from this plant. There are 
some other species : — P. odoratus (sweet- 
scented); P. laxiflorus (loose-flowered) ; and 
P. elerjans (elegant). They belong to the 
natural order Cyperaceas. They require good 
sized pots, rich loamy soil, and shallow water. 
Propagated by seeds or by division. 

Pistia Stratiotes (water-soldier-like Pistia), 
is a stove perennial plant, with curious ob- 
cordate leaves, and bears white flowers towards 
the end of the summer. It is found in various 
localities, but chiefly in the East Indies ; and 
belongs to the natural order Pistiaceas. This 
piant floats on the water without soil : it is 
increased by pulling to pieces, every piece 
producing a plant. 

Parhcria pteroides (Pterisdike Parkeria), 
is an aquatic fern. It is a native of Esse- 
quibo ; and belongs to the natural order 
Polypodiaceae. It should be potted in turfy 
loam and peat, the pots being only just im- 
mersed in w r ater ; propagated by divis : on or 
by seeds. 

Pontedera. — There are several species, all 
stove perennials. P. crassipes (thick petioled), 
has floating cordate-reniform leaves, the pe- 
tioles or stalks of which are remarkably in- 
flated when growing in the water, but not so 
when grown in ordinary soil ; the flowers are

will stand our winters, is yet properly at home 
in a greenhouse. It grows three feet high, 
with ovate leaves, and handsome blue flowers, 
in July and August ; native of South Caro- 
lina. It belongs to the natural order Ma- 
rantacca3. It requires a large pot of loamy 
soil, set in shallow water ; propagated by 
division. 

Trapa (Water Caltrops). — Three species. 
T. bicornis (two-horned), is a perennial plant 
of floating habit, with deltoid leaves, and pro- 
ducing white blossoms from June to August. 
It is cultivated by the Chinese in marshes, and 
its nuts or seeds are used as food ; in Japan 
they are used in broth. T. quadrispino'sd 
(four-spined), is a perennial, bearing white 
flowers from June to August ; native of Sylhet. 
T. bispinosa (two-spined), is an annual, with 
deltoid leaves, the stalks of which are bladdery, 
and bearing white flowers from June to August; 
native of the East Indies. They belong to the 
natural order Haloragaceas. They require 
large pots or tubs, rich loamy soil, and a mo- 
derate depth of water ; increased by seeds, 
which are eatable. The leaves, which grow 
under water, are cut into hair-shaped seg- 
ments. 

Victoria regia (Victoria "Water-lily), is a 
magnificent stove, perennial, with large floating 
leaves, from three to five or six feet in dia- 
meter, the edges turned up like a rim, three 
or four inches deep, red beneath ; the flowers 
white, changing to pink, deep rose in the 
centre, double, and a foot or more in diameter; 
native of Guiana and neighbouring countries. 
The plant was raised in 1846, at Kew, but 
the young plants have since died ; no doubt 
it will soon be again reared. It belongs to 
the natural order Nympha3acea3, The treat- 



ment of Nelumbiums and Nymphaaas will, no 
doubt, be proper for it : it will require much 
space. 

Villarsia. — There are several aquatic and 
bog species, all perennials. V. ovata (ovate- 
leaved), has oval leaves, and fringed orange 
coloured flowers, produced in a raceme-like 
manner from May to July ; native of bogs in 
the Cape of Good Hope. V. parnassrfolia 
(Parnassia-leaved), has orbiculate leaves, and 
a loose branching stem, two feet, bearing yel- 
low flowers from June to September : a variety 
of this, called reniformis (kidney-shaped), has 
kidney-shaped leaves, and a loose panicle of 
yellow flowers ; both are natives of bogs 
in New Holland. They belong to the order 
Gentianacea?. They require a greenhouse, 
and should be planted in pots of peat and 
cut sphagnum, and set in, but not covered 
with water; increased by division or by 
seeds. 

MESEMBRYANTHEMUMS; 

The profusion of blossoms produced by this 
extensive family of plants, and the neatness of 
their growth, ought to render them greater 
favourites than they seem to be at present, 
especially as summer ornaments to our flower 
garden. They are much hardier than is gene- 
rally supposed ; and although, from their suc- 
culent nature, they will not stand frost, yet 
they may with success be planted out in the 
open air much sooner in the spring than they 
usually are. Mesembryanthemums that are 
intended for planting out in the flower garden, 
should be repotted in March, in soil composed 
of fresh loam and peat in equal quantities, with 
a sufficient portion of sand to prevent it becom- 
ing compact or caked. When they are potted 
the soil should not be pressed very tight, and 
sufficient space should be left for half an inch 
of fine gravel (from which all the sand has been 
thoroughly washed) to be placed on the top ; 
this will keep the surface of the soil from be- 
coming hard, and also keep it moist ; for 
although these plants are impatient of wet, yet 
nothing is more detrimental to their vigorous 
growth than drought. After they are potted, 
they should be placed in a frame, and kept close 
and moderately warm till they have taken fresh 
root, when they should be gradually hardened 
that they may be ready to turn out by the end 
of April. In placing them in the open air, it 
is not essential that they be turned out of their 
pots. A warm sunny spot is proper for them; 
and it is best to cover the surface with stones. 
After they are turned out, they ought to have 
a slight framework of hoops placed over them, 
in order that they may be carefully protected 
from cold winds and heavy rain for some time, 
and especially at night. Thus treated, they 
will amply repay the trouble that has been

taken with them, by producing a constant suc- 
cession of their splendid blossoms till the frosts 
in autumn stop vegetation. 

Those who have not got a stock of these 
plants should set about obtaining cuttings, 
which may be rooted without any difficulty if 
planted in sandy soil, and kept moderately dry 
in a frame, or under a handlight in the green- 
house. Young plants raised late in the spring 
will not of course be so capable of producing 
the effect during summer which stronger plants 
would do, but they will gain strength, and 
should be taken up carefully before they 
have sustained any injury from frost; potted 
in sandy loam, in pots as small as the roots 
will allow, and carefully set by for the winter, 
on a dry shelf in the greenhouse, where they 
must be kept dry, only just water enough 
being given to prevent them from shrivelling. 
In the spring they should be again repotted, 
and planted out as above. 

BOTANICAL TERMS, 
CHIEFLY APPLIED TO THE LEAVES OF PLANTS. 

The terms employed in reference to leaves 
are very numerous; some of these apply equally 
to other parts of the plants, and many of them 
will hereafter be noticed separately under the 
head of, " Terms expressive of figure.'" 

Acerose (acerosus) ; needle-shaped, linear, 
rigid, tapering to a fine point from a narrow 
base, as in the leaves of the common juniper 
bush. 

Acinaciform (aeinaciformis) ; scimitar- 
shaped ; that is, curved, fleshy, plane on the 
two sides, with the concave border thick, and 
the convex one thin. 

JEqualivenium ; equal veined ; that is, 
when the mid-rib of the leaf is perfectly 
formed, and the veins are all of equal size, as 
in ferns. 

Alternate (alternus) ; where' leaves do not 
rise from the same plane, but are placed alter- 
nately one above the other round the stems, 
they are said to be alternate, in distinction 
from the arrangement where they are placed 
opposite each other. 

Amphigastria ; a term applied to certain 
lobes or appendages attached to the base of 
the leaves of some Jung er ma .niece.

of the vessels and veins. This is applied 
where the veins cross or touch each other, 
and unite where they come in contact. 

Apex (apice) ; the extremity opposite the 
base ; applied to the point of a leaf. 

Articulated (articulatus) ; jointed ; leaves 
are generally articulated with the stem, and 
the lamina is often articulated with the petiole. 
The articulation is manifest in compound 
leaves ; when they begin to fall to pieces, it 



will be observed that the parts separate, as 
it were, spontaneously, and without any 
fracture. 

Ascidium ; a singular dilation of the leaf- 
stalk in some plants, which forms what is 
called a pitcher, as in the pitcher plant (Ne- 
penthes), the cephalotus, sarracenia, and some 
others.

rounded lobes, or ear-like appendages, at the 
base of the lamina, as in the leaf of Salvia 
officinalis. 

Avenium ; veinless ; where there are no 
veins at all except perhaps the indication of 
a mid-rib, as in mosses, fuci, &c. These are 
not to be confounded with such as those which 
are very fleshy, and in which the veins are 
concealed. 

Axil ; the part where the base of the upper 
side of a leaf joins the stem- 

Axillary (axillaris) ; arising from an axil ; 
issuing from between the stem and the base 
of a leaf-stalk, where it meets the stem.

bigeminate. 

Bigeminate (bigeminatus) ; twice ; when 
each of two secondary leaf-stalks bears a pair 
of leaflets.

an alteration of the numeral at the beginning 
of the word it may be made to express any 
number of pairs.

on a common petiole, as in the leaves of 
Zygophyllum Fabago. 

Blade ; the lamina, or expanded surface of 
a leaf, as distinguished from the stalk.

tendrils or cirrhi. 

Cirrhus ; a tendril, or thread-shaped pro- 
cess, issuing from the stem, by means of which, 
plants with weak or climbing stems attach 
themselves to other plants or substances for 
support. 

Collare ; a term applied to the ligule of

THE TULTP\ 




GLENNY ON THE TULIP, 

ITS CULTURE AND PROPERTIES. 



According to our notions, there is not a more 
striking object in a well-kept garden than a 
choice collection of tulips, properly planted 
and protected. This flower, although by no 
means striking in the borders, and telling 
merely as a gaudy and hardy addition to the 
flowers of spring, is, when in collection, pro- 
perly arranged, and growing under canvass, 
a very noble and imposing addition to any 
garden establishment. That the tulip is so 
hardy as to grow in any soil and situation, and 
through any kind of weather, is not to be 
denied ; but the difference between the same 
variety exposed to hardships, and properly cul- 
tivated, is so great as to repay the most care- 
ful management, and will reward the cultivator 
for all the care he can bestow. The Dutch, 
for many years, surpassed us in the growth of 
this our favourite ornament of the parterre. 
The length of time which it takes to produce 
a blooming tulip from seed, even under the 
most favourable circumstances, for many years 
deterred the English growers from taking any 
pains to produce new varieties ; and our 
neighbours having more industry, and, more- 
over, a soil and situation that were naturally 
adapted for their culture, took and kept the 
lead for many years. 



We are not going, here, to give a long 
history of the tulip mania, and the enormous 
prices which particular varieties have been 
known to bring (and which was regardless 
altogether of the quality of the flower), because 
it does not afford the least instruction. It is 
sufficient to say, that tulips were bought and 
sold, like shares and stock, " per time ;" and 
if a man had engaged to deliver, at the proper 
period, tulips which he found, to his cost 
perhaps, had all been bought up, he was 
obliged to offer enough to tempt somebody to 
part from them, or to make his buyer make up 
the account. The value of the tulip had, 
therefore, nothing to do with the price which 
had to be paid to make up the amount. Thus 
a man possesses himself of all he can buy of 
some flower not at all plentiful, and, having 
done this, he offers publicly to buy more ; 
others, who want to gamble, and calculate that 
they can get plenty, agree to sell and deliver 
a certain number at the taking up. This is 
carried on till the buyer has got people engaged 
to deliver more than there are in existence, 
and this being the case, the price must go up 
until the buyer is satisfied. If he knows they 
are not to be got, he may become arbiter of 
the price at which he will settle, and they are

all obliged to succumb to his terms. But in 
England we have had tolerable prices given 
for tulips, for their scarcity and quality com- 
bined. 100Z. and 1201. are prices that have 
been paid within our own time ; and for 
the last twenty years we have surpassed the 
Dutch in the quality of many new varieties. 

The selection of a bed of tulips is a task of 
no ordinary difficulty ; but a good deal of 
this arises from fashion. There are certain 
old flowers thought nothing of because they 
are old, but they are essential in a good bed. 
There are certain other flowers run after 
because they are more scarce and more dear, 
but are by no means so good. The young 
beginner is too often sacrificed in his first 
purchases ; this is too bad, because there is 
no reason why a young cultivator should be 
served worse than an old one. There are 
plenty of good flowers cheap, or cheap flowers 
good, and he should at least have these. No- 
body should try to get an extensive collection 
at first ; it is better to form the bed of thirty- 
six sorts, and have plenty of each, than to ex- 
tend the number of varieties for mere exten- 
sion's sake. It is very well to exchange some 
for better after these have been grown some 
time ; but a bed formed of about thirty-six 
kinds, all clean and fine, would be much more 
striking than some that are costly beyond 
description, because in tulips, as in anything 
else, the price is regulated by the scarcity or 
plentifulness, far more than by the quality. 
Polyphemus, which, when bloomed well, is the 
first bizarre in the world, is cheap because it 
has propagated rapidly, and there are such 
great quantities about. The properties of the 
tulip were never defined, so as to be under- 
stood, until the establishment of the Metropo- 
litan Society, and the publication of the 
properties caused a vast alteration in the 
prices of some which had till then been in high 
regard. These properties are now well under- 
stood, and any striking fault so lowers the 
value, that what would have been esteemed a 
few years ago, would now be thrown away, 
or at least would bring but a low price, how- | 
ever new or scarce it might be. To all young 
beginners we would, therefore, say, buy cheap 
but clean flowers, and rather have twenty of 
a sort that is clean, than seek to diversify the 
collection by any that are dirty or foul. In 
this paper we propose to give such instruction 
to the young amateur as will enable him to 
make a show the first year, as fine as a more 
experienced grower ; and that will encourage 
him to persevere. 

SOIL AND SITUATION. 

There is no soil so good for a bed of tulips 
as the top spit of a loamy pasture, with the 
turf rotted in it. Let the spit be taken off 



about six inches thick, and be laid in a heap 
to rot. A year is generally sufficient for the 
rotting, but so important is it that it should be 
freed from all sorts of vermin, that at the end 
of six months the heap ought to be chopped 
through, and the soil examined and thrown 
into another heap, and every living thing be 
taken out of it ; this can only be done by re- 
peated turnings. If time will permit to lay 
it by two seasons instead of one, the heap need 
not be disturbed the first year at all, but the 
more it is chopped about the second year the 
better. Grubs and wire-worms, which are 
the enemies of flowers and vegetables alike, 
are nearly always to be found in turves ; and 
the rotting of the turf in the loam is, never- 
theless, the best kind of manure or dressing 
for the tulip. But if this kind of soil cannot 
be had, and the loam can only be got pure, 
without any dressing at all, the best help to 
it is leaf mould ; that is, leaves rotted into 
mould, about one-fourth part of which should 
be added. The loam should be what is com- 
monly called hazel loam, that is, of a brown 
colour, and the quality, as to adhesiveness, 
such as will enable you to stir and bruise it 
easily ; for when the loam is too adhesive, it 
is very inconvenient, because the rain runs it 
together, and when you attempt to stir the 
surface, it comes up in lumps which are not 
easily crumbled. Thus there is a great loss 
of time, and considerable danger of damaging 
the bulbs. Nevertheless, a tulip will grow 
moderately well in any kitchen garden soil, 
and if you cannot get what you want, be not 
afraid to use what you can. The situation 
should be protected against wind, if possible, 
as it saves much trouble, and prevents the 
necessity of covering them up close when 
wind prevails much ; the bed is to be placed 
north and south or thereabouts, where it can 
be made to fall in with the garden plan ; but, 
of course, it would not do to form it contrary 
to the length or the width of the ground. It 
should either be down or across the garden, 
whichever ranges best with the north and 
south, but we do not attach so much impor- 
tance to this as some do. 

FORMATION OF THE BED. 

The space for the bed should have three 
feet of properly prepared compost. If the 
ground be low it is better to have two feet 
dug out, and one foot above the surface of the 
ground ; if dry, two feet six or eight inches 
should be dug out, and five or six inches be 
above. The hole should be dug four feet 
wide, and if the garden be not well drained 
it ought to be, for nothing can do well long 
together if the ground be naturally wet. On 
the bottom may be put good rotten cow -dung 
rotted into mould, full two inches thick ; on 
p 2

THE TULIP. 



this put the soil you intern! growing them in, 
to the full height you mean it to be, and let it 
settle down. When you plant, you Avill find 
the compost settled down full three inches, 
and this quantity has to he supplied after the 
bulbs are put in. Some persons, for neatness' 
sake, have a framework of w r ood to form the 
bed. In this case inch-and-quarter boards 
ought to be used, stakes being driven down 
at the outer edge of the space, so as to fasten 
the boards exactly to the dimensions intended 
for the bed, which should be four feet wide, 
and the length intended according to the 
number of rows. Fifty rows make a hand- 
some bed twenty-five feet long ; but they may 
be extended to any length. Amateurs have 
the fastened board three inches lower than the 
bed is intended to be finished off, and then 
have a three-inch board to go on, and fasten 
with pins and staples. The object of this 
will be seen in the directions for planting. 

ARRANGING THE BED. 

The proper way of arranging the varieties 
is to have the flowers opposite to each other, 
of the same sort ; that is to say, the two 
outside ones alike ; the two next to the out- 
side should be alike, and those on each side 
the middle one should be of the same sort. 
Every row ought to be so, and by changing 
the middle flower, all the rows will be different. 
Tulips, as is known to growers, consist of 
Roses, Byblomens, and Bizarres ; and the 
arrangement of these must be such as to place 
all the tallest in the centre, the next in height 
on each side the centre, shorter ones on each 
side these, and the shortest outside. The 
bulbs are planted in rows six inches apart, 
seven in the rows across the bed, and any 
number you please along them. Suppose the 
bed to be fifteen feet long, it will hold thirty 
in length ; or if twenty-five feet long it will 
hold fifty in length. Taking the former, 
which every beginner could now compass 
very well, there would be required thirty middle 
row flowers — sixty of the first row, sixty of 
the second row, and sixty of the third row ; 
because, as regards the height of the flowers, 
there are two outside rows called first rows, 
two of similar height next to them, and called 
second rows, and two of equal height next to 
the middle row, called third rows ; thus : — 



tliis would be the case to any length of the 
bed. if there were a hundred rows, the middle 
row being called indiscriminately fourth row, 
or middle row, or centre row. It used to be 
the fashion to keep to the heights only, but 
there were persons, who, besides attending to 
that particular, also took pains to prevent two j 



roses, or two byblomens, or two bizarres, from 
coming together in the same row ; and the 
old school of florists did this by beginning 
from one end of the bed with the rose, by Wo- 
men, bizarre ; rose, byblomen, bizarre, and 
so on, by which, there being seven in a row, 
they all ran alternately thus : — 

Eose Byb. Biz. Eose Byb. Biz. Eose 
Byb. Biz. Eose Byb. Biz. Eose Byb. 
Biz. Eose Byb. Biz. Eose Byb. Biz. 

and so on; by which arrangement, there was 
certainly no two of a class came together in 
the same row, but the classes were not uniform 
in the bed. With some difficulty they were 
got out of their old prejudices sufficiently to 
make the arrangement uniform, and put thesame 
classes on each side the middle row thus : — 

Eose Byb. Biz. Eose Biz. Byb. Eose 
Byb. Biz. Eose Byb. Eose Biz. Byb. 
Biz. Eose Byb. Biz. Byb. Eose Biz. 

Here we have the same class flowers at each 
side of the centre, and it greatly diversified the 
bed, and preserved a good deal of uniformity 
and brilliancy ; but it was capable of still 
greater improvement. It was seen that flowers 
of the same class might be dark and light, 
bright and dull, large and small, and that the 
only way to have them really uniform, was to 
have the same identical varieties on each side 
of the centre, thus : — 

Eeine Poly- Eose Poly- Seine 

de phe- Claudi- phe- de 
Sheba mus ana mus Sheba 

Here there was the same heights and colours, 
the same sizes, the same everything to make 
uniformity and continuity ; this, through the 
bed, would secure an effectwhich could be pro- 
duced no other way. It must be recollected 
that the young bulbs, although large enough 
to bloom, do not grow so tall as full-grown 
ones, so that flowers of any sort may be con- 
sidered as applicable to two rows. Thus some 
are third and fourth row, others first and 
second row, which means that if small they 
will not come to their full height. Holme's 
King, Ambassador, Siam, Violet Alexander, 
Louis XVI. are third and fourth-row flowers, 
because the full-grown ones will grow tall 
enough for the centre, and moderate sized 
ones will be but in the third row. 

PLANTING. 

The bed being four feet wide, it allows of 
six inches' distance between the flowers, and 
six inches from the outside row to the edge 
of the bed. If there be no boarded edge, the 
earth must be levelled and brought to exactly 
three inches lower than it is intended to be 
when planted. If, however, there has been 
a boarded edge, with three inches of the board 
to take off and put on as may be wanted, the 
three inch piece must be taken off, and the

soil levelled to the edge of the boarded border. 
In both cases strike a tight line down the 
centre of the bed, and make a slight drill or 
mark. Then remove the line six inches on 
one side of the mark, and make another mark ; 
then do the same six inches from the last, and 
again six inches from this ; you will then have 
four drills, which complete one side of the 
centre ; do the same on the other side, and 
the seven rows will be marked. Get a straight 
piece of wood, and by the help of another 
person begin by measuring six inches from the 
end as a guide for each, and press the wood 
gently into the soil at the exact distance, and 
by removing each end six inches, and pressing 
it into the soil only just enough to make a 
mark, you will complete the marking of the 
bed. It, however, saves a good deal of time 
and trouble, if, when the wooden edging is 
made, the place for the rows be notched or 
painted on the edge of the boarding ; the 
lines are then sure to be right, and the opera- 
tion is quicker as well as more accurate. The 
marks being made, the tulips — which should 
be arranged in boxes, whose partitions repre- 
sent the places Avhere the bulbs are to go — are 
to be planted. These boxes have seven par- 
titions the narrowest way, and an indefinite 
number the longest way, because it matters 
not how many of such boxes or drawers are 
used. The convenient size is about ten in 
length, as larger than that is inconvenient ; 
three of these would do for a bed of thirty 
rows, and they should be numbered in front 
from 1 to 30 ; and each of the numbers 
represents seven to cross the bed. In the 
book there must be a corresponding record, 
something like the following : —

2. Madame Yestris, Rose 

3. Siam, Byblomen

5. Siam, Byblomen

7. Globe, Bizarre. 

In this way would be recorded the contents of 
all the rows up to thirty, or any larger num- 



ber : it is only necessary to increase the 
number of boxes or drawers. The bed being 
ready, and marked for the bulbs, the planter 
and assistant should be one on each side the 
bed. The principal should have the boxes on 
his side, and having planted, or rather placed 
(for the bulb is only to be gently pressed into the 
soil where the lines cross each other) the first, 
second, third, and fourth himself, he should 
hand the fifth, sixth, and seventh to his assist- 
ant ; and so they go down the bed to the last 
row. If the bed be boarded, put on the three- 
inch top all round, and fill up with the com- 
post, even with the top of the additional board, 
which forms the best guide : if the soil is put 
on a little round, it is none the worse for it, as 
it shoots the water to the sides in a heavy fall 
of wet ; and while the side bulbs are by the 
slight rise left about three inches below the 
surface, the stronger ones towards the centre 
are somewhat deeper, which is none the worse 
for these. If there is no boarding, and no three- 
inch border to guide, place a few pegs here 
and there, just three inches above the surface 
on the side, and four inches above the surface 
in the middle, as guides in putting on the soil. 
The best way is to sift it on through a coarse 
sieve, but it may be done with a spade, care 
being taken that the bulbs are not disturbed 
by the process. It has been the practice of 
some, and we have frequently done it our- 
selves, to put a cone of silver sand over every 
bulb. It is of no use except at taking up time, 
when it is a sort of guide to the spot where 
a bulb ought to be found, which in cases where 
they may partly fail, and only leave an offset, 
may be of use ; but as careful persons will 
take up their bulbs before the stems have 
rotted down, or at least shrivelled more than 
half way down, it is only good for a mark. 
The tulip is no better in sand than in any 
other clean compost. When the surface is 
adjusted, and the bulbs are covered three 
inches, and the middle ones to four inches, the 
bed may be left. 

MANAGEMENT AFTERWARDS TILL BLOOM. 

The tulip is so hardy, that many persons 
leave the bed without any kind of protection 
till the plants are up ; but in severe frosts, 
although the plant may not suffer, the embryo 
flower may, and often does : the effects are 
blights, split petals, deeply notched edges, dis- 
colorations, and occasionally damage to the 
bulb itself. Some varieties are very suscep- 
tible of damage, though not easily killed. To 
make sure of a fine bloom, frost ought not to 
reach the bulb ; and the moi^ the growth is 
advanced, the more mischievous does the effect 
prove. If we therefore desired to be free from 
the chance of a bad bloom, we should exclude 
the frost from the inou ?nt of planting, by 



214 



THE TULIP. 



covering the bed with fern, or loose litter of 
any kind, whenever there was a chance of frost ; 
but beware of protecting from frost in the be- 
ginning, and omitting it when they are forward. 
When the plants are above ground, the surface 
of the soil should be stirred all over, all the 
lumps bruised, and the earth laid close round 
the stems ; and if there has been no covering 
previously, it should be carefully applied now. 
The ordinary practice is to cover the bed over 
with bent hoops or irons made on purpose, 
and cloths or mats thrown over them, in pro- 
portion to the severity of the weather, will be 
found generally effective ; when the hoops or 
irons are placed across the bed, long slips of 
wood should be lashed along the top or roof 
portion, and a coarse net should be stretched 
all over it, and fastened down all round. It 
keeps the cats off, and prevents birds from dis- 
turbing the surface ; and, besides this, it 
enables us to throw the mats or cloths over 
without falling into hollows which would hold 
the wet, or make it run through in parts, and 
drip on the plants. These measures are also 
necessary to prevent hail and violent rains 
from doing injury to the brittle leaves. Very 
mild showers do good instead of harm ; and it 
is impossible to give too much air, therefore, 
the bed ought not to be covered an hour un- 
necessarily, while it is equally important to 
cover against frost, hail, or heavy showers. 
This treatment applies up to the very period 
of blooming. 

THE STAGE AND TOP CLOTH. 

When the bloom buds have grown up a few- 
inches, and the striped colours are indicated, if 
there be a proper stage erected, the top cloth 
should be put on. This should roll up and 
clown the roof on both sides, and be contrived 
so that the two lines are both at one end, and 
that the nearest to the entrance to the garden, 
or the part in which there is most likely to be 
some one in attendance, or at work. Very 
sudden hailstorms prevail at this season, 
and the smallest hailstorm that touches the 
bud, will cause a mark or blight on the spot it 
strikes ; on the least appearance of a coming 
squall, therefore, the cloths should be let down, 
till it is passed over ; but it is of the utmost 
importance that the bed should be as much as 
possible uncovered. When the side cloths are 
placed, the hoops and net work should be re- 
moved altogether ; and when the colours are 
showing strong, the sun should be kept off, not 
by lowering the cloths of the roof altogether, 
but by carefully lowering every hour just so 
much of the cloth on the sunny side, as will 
shade the bed, and no more. It will be found 
that, by constant tvatching, not more than one 
half the bed need be covered at all at one time, 
and the object of covering as little as possible 



is, to prevent the stems from being drawn up 
weakly. The growers of the present day are 
so anxious to prevent the drawing of the plants, 
that they rarely cover enough in the early 
part of the growth, and the result is, that 
perfect blooms fit for exhibition are scarce, 
even in the best beds. The older growers used 
to-go to the other extreme, and it was a com- 
mon thing to see a cord stretched down each 
row to support them, as they frequently could 
not support themselves. It is, however, quite 
possible to cover from bad weather without 
drawing them, if sufficient care be taken that 
they are not covered unnecessarily. Where 
there is no proper house and covering, the 
hoops or irons, nets, and covering that did for 
the early protection, must be continued for the 
late covering, for the bloom is soon gone, unless 
protected from the sun, rain, and w r ind. 

TREATMENT AFTER BLOOM. 

The covering must be removed as soon as 
the bloom declines, and the bed must have all 
the sun and air until the leaves and stems die 
down ; but as weeds will rapidly grow, they 
must be kept under by hand pulling while 
they are young ; the roots of weeds do great 
mischief to the bulbs, and therefore must not 
be allowed to get a-head. 

TAKING UP OF THE BULBS. 

In taking up the bulbs, the boxes from which 
they w r ere planted must be placed as they were 
at planting time; and by rights two persons 
should be engaged in the process, beginning 
at number one in the first row ; the operator 
should be careful to put the trowel down suf- 
ficiently close to bring up the bulb, but not 
near enough to injure it. He should throw 
out the earth, and make a sort of trench next 
the wood-work or end of the bed, not too close 
to the tulips, and by thrusting the trowel down 
between the first and second row, and turning 
out the bulbs one at a time, he may replace all 
the stock in the partitions or holes they came out 
of. With a sharp knife he ought to cut off the 
stems within half an inch of the bulbs, and 
put the bulbs, with the dirt hanging about 
them, into the drawers ; as the drawers are 
filled they should be placed in the shade, be- 
cause they require drying before they are 
cleaned, and when thoroughly dried they may 
be cleaned of their superfluous skins, and put 
aw r ay in a dry and airy place. There is, in 
fact, as will be seen by this practice, no diffi- 
culty whatever in growing tulips. 

TULIPS FROM SEED. 

The seeds of tulips should be saved from 
thick-petaled, well-shaped, and bright flowers 
only ; although some take pains to cross them 
with this, that, and the other variety, or believe 



THE TULIP. 



;io 



the only proper way to raise good flowers is to 
grow no bad ones. The seed should be sown 
in boxes or pans, or large pots — we prefer the 
latter — any time between October and Feb- 
ruary, and be placed under a frame and glass ; 
or if there be sufficient, a frame may be filled 
up or prepared on purpose. Place the frame on 
the ground, fill it within three inches of the 
top edge with well-sirted compost, such as is 
recommended for beds, and in the same sloping 
direction as the glass, or top edge of the frame; 
sow thinly all over the surface ; sift over the 
seeds to the thickness of a quarter of an inch; 
cover from frost and heavy falls, but in fine 
weather let them have all the air, and a mild 
shower whenever it comes. Here they may 
remain with no other care than watering and 
weeding, until the leaves die down, when the 
small bulbs, not larger than peas, must be very 
carefully taken up, and when all have been 
taken that can be obtained in the ordinary 
way, the top three inches should be sifted in a 
fine sieve, when others, not seen at first, will 
be found among the small lumps and stones 
left in the sieve. These, after being out a 
month or so, may be planted in a bed made up 
for the purpose ; put them in drills not more 
than two inches apart in the row, and 
the rows may be three, four, or six inches 
apart, for the sake of the more easily keeping 
the bed clear of weeds ; they should be planted 
at the depth of two inches. The following 
year they may be planted three inches apart 
in the row, and the year after four inches. To 
grow seedlings profusely, they ought, from the 
very first year, to be kept in separate bags, 
with their offsets, for some will be found with 
such the very first season after the seed year, 
and we have often taken up two little bulbs, 
one below the other, the very year they were 
sown. About the fifth, sixth, and seventh 
years, some of them will begin to bloom, most 
of a self colour ; they may now be ticketed 
as breeder tulips, and now the use of keeping 
them all separate with their increase will be 
seen. As they bloom, if they have thin petals, 
or foul bottoms, or are of a bad shape, throw 
away not only the blooming roots, but all the 
offsets also. If they have not been kept sepa- 
rate, all the offsets of the worthless varieties 
will be among the stock, and continue plaguing 
the grower for years ; while, on the other hand, 
if a variety pi'ove of fine form, of thick petal, 
smooth edge, and clear ground colour, the 
whole stock may be as carefully preserved as 
the bad ones are excluded. When a flower 
breaks from the self or breeder colour into 
stripes, it will be seen whether the stock be 
valuable or not. 

We have now simply to give a calendrical 
remembrancer for each month. 

January. The bulbs are now in the ground, 



and in most seasons not showing above, but 
they are shooting in the ground, and if we are 
right in our conclusions, a frost ought not to 
reach any that are destined for a fine bloom ; 
cover therefore carefully against frost. Sow 
seed. 

February. Many of the earliest, in a fine 
open season, will be up in the course of this 
month, and require protection ; cover therefore 
carefully on any appearance or likelihood of 
frost. Seed may still be sown, though it is 
better done earlier. 

March. Stir the earth all over the surface 
of the bed; bruise the lumps, and place the 
mould close to the stems of the plants. Cover 
more carefully than ever as the plants advance. 
Seedlings must also be protected, and if in 
exposed beds, let some good litter be placed 
upon the beds, as it is a great protection if 
loose and dry ; pea haulm, fern leaves, or clean 
straw are useful. The earth should be stirred 
also in all the outbeds, and the weeds care- 
fully removed. 

April. Watchfulness as to covering against 
bad weather and frost, is now more necessary 
than last month. If seed is up the sun must 
be kept off, and watering may be necessary, as 
whether they be under a frame, or in pots 
under glass, they are deprived of showers ; 
mild showers may be allowed to refresh all the 
beds, and coverings should be removed for that 
purpose ; but if there be the least indication 
of frost, the covering must be very effective. 
Towards the end of the month the top cloth 
should be put in its place, ready for the double 
use of keeping off sun and heavy falls. 

May. This is the blooming month ; the sun 
must be constantly prevented from shining on 
them, all the heat of the day, from the moment 
they begin to show their colours well, and be- 
fore they open. The whole of the blooms 
should be examined by the book, and obser- 
vations should be written against each ; not 
only a general mark as to correctness, but also 
as to the exact quality, whether good, or fine, 
or very fine, and any remarks that may strike 
the grower as worth noting — such as a flower 
being tall enough for the middle row when it 
is in the second row, or any flower being too 
short for its place ; these remarks enable a 
person to make proper alterations before next 
planting time. Examine also seedlings and 
breeder tulips, that you may throw away those 
good for nothing, and keep others that are 
promising. Keep all clear from weeds. 

June. The flowers go off this month, and 
towards the end of it you may begin taking up 
bulbs, especially in the outer beds. The rule 
for this must be the state of the foliage, which 
ought to have turned yellow, and begun to 
shrivel, before any of the valuable sorts are 
disturbed. Seedlings of a small size must 



216 



THE TULIP. 



be also taken up as soon as the leaves are 
dead. 

' July. Finish taking up the bulbs, and let 
the boxes be set in the shade, to harden and 
dry the bulbs ; have the mould of all the beds 
sifted, to collect any bulbs or offsets tbat might 
h:ive escaped. Any very small offsets of valu- 
able sorts may be re-planted at once in pots, 
as they will often shrivel before planting time. 

August. Clean all the bulbs of their dirt and 
skins, and also of the bi ts of stem left on them at 
taking up, and put the drawers away in a cool 
dry place. The smallest seedlings, and also 
the unripe offsets that are worth the trouble, 
should be planted again at once ; throw out 
the compost from the beds, and chop it about 
occasionally, to see there are neither grubs nor 
wire-worms among it, for both are enemies to 
the tulip. 

September. Begin to arrange your beds, 
removing those which are too short or tall, or 
wrong sorts, or not appropriate, into places bet- 
ter adapted for them ; all these alterations must 
be made in the boxes, and carefully noted in 
the book for the next season. Turn over the 
compost of the beds. 

October. Plant offsets so as to get them 
out of the way before the general planting 
time comes ; the seedlings and breeders may 
also be all planted this month, leaving nothing 
till next month, but the principal beds. Return 
all the compost to the best bed, and if it be 
the same the tulips grew in last season, put 
some rotten cow-dung, about two feet from 
the surface, full two inches thick all over the 
bottom. 

November. Plant the rest of the stock, 
the best bed as well as others ; sow seed, and 
keep offset beds clear of weeds. The whole 
of the bulbs ought to be planted early in 
the month. 

December. Sow seed, keep all beds clear 
of weeds, and if any bulbs be left out of the 
ground, lose not an hour in planting them. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The necessity of planting as early as 
directed, if the weather permit, may be ap- 
preciated on consideration of the fact that the 
weather often causes all operations to be sus- 
pended for a month or six weeks. "We have, 
ourselves, been unable to do it at the proper 
moment, and although we could have done it 
a fortnight later, had the weather served us, 
we have been thrown out (and we remember 
one year in particular) until the 11th of 
January. The bulbs always suffer from the 
time they begin to shoot until they are in the 
ground; the cultivator who will pay common 
attention to these simple rules, however un- 
important some may seem, will find his reward 
in a good bloom and healthy bulbs. 



PROPERTIES OP THE TULIP. 

First. — The cup should form when quite 
expanded from half to a third of a hollow ball. 
To do this, the petals must be six in number ; 
broad at the ends, smooth at the edges, and the 
divisions between the petals scarcely to show an 
indenture. (See illustration.} 

Second. — The three inner petals should set 
close to the three outer ones, and the whole 
should be broad enough to allow of the fullest 
expansion without quartering (as it is called), 
that is, exhibiting any vacancy between the 
petals. 

Third. — The petals should be thick, smooth, 
and stiff, and keep their form well. 

Fourth. — The ground should be clear and 
distinct, whether white or yellow. The least 
stain, even at the lower end of the petal, would 
render a tulip comparatively valueless. 

Fifth. — Roses, byblomens, and bizarres, are 
the three classes into which tulips are now 
divided. The first have a white ground, and 
crimson, or pink, or scarlet marks ; the second 
have white grounds, and purple, lilac, or black 
marks ; and the last have yellow grounds, with 
any coloured marks. 

Sixth. — Whatever be the disposition of 
colours or marks upon a tulip, all the six petals 
should be marked alike, and be therefore per- 
fectly uniform. 

Seventh. — The feathered flowers should 
have an even, close feathering all round, and 
whether narrow or wide, light or heavy, should 
reach far enough round the petals to form, 
when they are expanded, an unbroken edging 
all round. 

Eighth. — If the flower have any marking 
besides the feathering at the edge, it should be 
a beam, or bold mark down the centre, but not 
to reach the bottom, or near the bottom of 
the cup ; the mark or beam must be similar 
in all the six petals. 

Ninth. — Flowers not feathered, and with 
flame only, must have no marks on the edges 
of the flower. None of the colour must break 
through to the edge. The colour may be dis- 
posed in any form so that it be perfectly uni- 
form in all the petals, and does not go too 
near the bottom. 

Tenth. — The colour, whatever it be, must 
be dense and decided. Whether it be delicate 
and light, or bright, or dark, it must be dis- 
tinct in its outline, and not shaded, or flushed, 
or broken. 

Eleventh. — The height should be eighteen 
to thirty- six inches; the former is right for 
the outside row in a bed, and the latter is right 
for the highest row. 

Twelfth. — The purity of the white, and the 
brightness of the yellow, should be permanent, 
that is to say, should stand until the petals 
actually fall. 






THE HYACINTH. 



217 




GLENNY ON THE HYACINTH. 



The soil in which the Hyacinth is so suc- 
cessfully grown in Holland is, doubtless, the 
alluvial soil of the place, but much is done by 
dressing it. Naturally a grey, sandy and not 
very rich earth, it requires then twice its bulk 
of manure, which is three-fourths cow dung, 
and one-fourth vegetable mould. In England 
the nearest we can get to perfection in the way 
of compost is rotted turves, not cut more than 
three inches thick originally, and allowed to 
lay in heaps till the vegetable parts have be- 
come mould ; this should be rubbed through a 
coarse sieve that would let a marble through, 
and as it falls through on the heap some one 
ought to be on the watch to detect the wire- 
worm or grub, for they show very plainly as 
the earth falls through on the heap, and runs 
down the sides. One half of this compost, and 
the other half made up of two parts cow dung, 
and one part clean well-washed sand, will grow 
the Hyacinth as well as they are grown in 
Holland. The compost must be well mixed, 



and should lay together all the warm months, 
in a situation where it can have all the sun, 
and be turned over several times. 

PREPARATION OF THE BED. 

In September dig out a space four feet in 
width, and as long as the number of bulbs to 
be planted in one bed require, reckoning that 
fourteen grow in every foot of length, namely, 
two cross rows of seven in a row. Let the 
depth be two feet, and the place well drained. 
At the bottom put three inches' thickness of 
cow dung or horse dung rotted into mould or 
thoroughly decomposed ; the dung from an old 
melon or cucumber bed will answer ; upon this 
put the compost from the heap already de- 
scribed, and fill it up three inches above the 
surface of the ordinary ground, for the com- 
post will subside ; towards the end of the 
month it will have sunk a good deal, and more 
must be put on so as to make it quite level 
with the surface of the other ground.

THE HYACINTH. 



ARRANGEMENT OF THE BULBS. 

To make a bed look to the best advantage 
you must choose such bulbs as will all blow in 
one season, that is to say, at one time, for 
nothing looks worse, or more completely mars 
the effect of a bed, than to have some bloom- 
ing and others not showing colour in the early 
season, and some decayed while the others are 
in flower when it is later. The colours should 
be diversified according to arrangement, and it 
would be well to get all the varieties of the 
same length or near it. The arrangement 
that would be most effective is that described 
below ; it is impossible to give a better con- 
trast in each row, or from row to row. It is 
also desirable to limit the varieties to one of 
each colour, that is to say, the dark blue only 
one sort, the light blue only one sort, and so on, 
each colour being represented by only one kind. 
The subjoined is the arrangement proposed : —

rights the bed should be boarded round with a 
six-inch rim to fix on, for then the compost to 
cover in with would be so easily regulated. 
Have hoops or irons across the bed, to enable 
you to cover them against frost and heavy falls 
of snow or hail, and it is worth while to have 
a stage over them, and a cloth like those for 
tulips and carnations. 

MANAGEMENT TJP TO BLOOMING TIME. 

The only necessary attention now is to pro- 
tect them against bad weather through the 
winter months, and for this purpose litter of 
any kind will answer all November, December, 
and January. In February, or March, accord- 
ing to the season, they will be above ground, 
and then the mats or cloths must be used ; 
because the bloom buds, if affected no other 
way, will be greatly stunted in size by frost. 
As the blooms begin to show colour, they must 
be shaded from the violent heat of the sun and 
from strong winds ; it may be necessary to place 
sticks and tie up the stems of the taller kinds, 
but they cannot be too dwarf for beds. As the 
bloom advances, they must be shaded from the 
sun, for it would materially shorten the period 
of their flowering if they were exposed to its 
scorching rays. 

AFTER BLOOMING. 

The whole of the covering should be removed 
as soon as the perfection of the bloom has 
gone, and the plants must have the benefit of 
all the rain and air until the leaves turn yellow. 
They may then be taken up in as many baskets 
as there are sorts, and as a simple mode of 
doing it, perhaps the best way would be to 
take up one sort at a time, because there can 
then be no mistake ; the kinds all form lines 
in particular directions, and the roots are so 
large that there is no danger of missing any, 
like tulips, which occasionally elude our vigi- 
lance, however careful we may be. The bulbs 
should be taken to a shady place under cover, 
and be laid out to dry off, and remain there 
until the foliage is completely dead, after which 
they should be trimmed, that is, the stalks and 
leaves should be cut close, and the fibres pulled 
off, and the offsets taken away ; they may then 
be put away for the season of rest. 

TREATMENT OF OFFSETS. 

Prepare beds similar to those for blooming 
the finer bulbs, and plant the offsets in the same 
number of rows, but they may be three inches 
instead of six inches apart, one of the ways, 
whether across or lengthways is immate- 
rial in respect to the bulbs, but probably it 
is best to have them close in the cross rows, 
instead of the long ones, on account of their 
being easier kept clear of weeds. Plant them 
so as to be four or five inches covered. "When 
they are up, any that show bloom should be 
deprived of all the buds but one or two at the 



THE HYACINTH.

top of the truss or spike ; one is enough if you 
can ensure it, though two are left until it is 
seen that the top one will stand. These beds 
need not have any protection beyond a little 
litter of some kind loosely laid upon the top. 
When the foliage has decayed down, the bulbs 
may be taken up as the matured ones are, and 
the whole sorted ; the larger ones to be put in 
six inches apart instead of three ; they are to be 
replanted and treated similarly each year until 
they arrive at the size which is marketable, 
and this may be generally told by the size of 
the spike, which should be reduced to a single 
top pip, season after season, until it will come 
sufficiently large to look well with the matured 
bulbs. The object of depriving the spike of 
its buds all but one, is to throw the strength 
that would be divided among the flowers into 
the bulb itself. 

RAISING FROM SEED. 

Hyacinths readily yield seed when in the 
open ground, though rarely when housed or 
forced. This seed should not be gathered till 
the vessels turn yellow, when it may be cut 
off with the stem, and placed in the sun to 
dry. Prepare a bed as for the offsets, and 
having raked the surface very smooth, sow the 
seed very thinly and evenly all over it ; then 
sift more of the compost over the seed so as to 
cover half an inch. When the young plants 
come up they will not be without weeds, 
which must, as soon as they can be got hold of, 
be removed by hand : nothing will prove more 
mischievous than allowing weeds to grow ; 
and therefore it must be looked upon as abso- 
lutely necessary to prevent it by hand weeding 
as often as may be required, even twice in a 
week, for the small bulbs must not be inter- 
rupted by the fibres of weeds. When the 
foliage has died down, once more clear the 
bed of weeds, and sift a good inch and a half 
of compost upon them all over : this will not 
be too deep for the plants to come through, 
and it will be a great protection against frost ; 
but besides this, it will be necessary to place 
some litter on the surface all the winter 
months. They will come up much stronger 
the second season, and must be constantly 
weeded as before : when the foliage has died 
down again, the bulbs will be large enough to 
take up. Let the bed be prepared as before, 
and in September, or early in October, plant 
them three inches apart in the row, and six 
inches from row to row like offsets, and this 
to be repeated season after season, except that 
when large enough to justify it, they are to be 
placed six inches apart, instead of three. As 
they indicate bloom, treat them as offsets are 
treated, by pulling off all the pips but one or 
two at the top of the spike ; continue this 
until they are matured in size and strong in 
flower. When however they first begin to 



throw up bloom, throw away any one not 
better than we have got, for new things not 
better than those we already possess are worth- 
less, except as mixtures. As soon therefore 
as any of this kind show themselves, condemn 
them. Generally speaking the improvements 
on old sorts are so few, that the cultivator will 
have but little trouble to mark the few worth 
propagating ; the rest may be considered 
defunct, and only fit for borders. 

MONTHLY OPERATIONS. 

Januarf. — The bulbs being in the ground, 
and requiring nothing but protection against 
hard frosts, should be covered with litter of 
some kind. 

February. — A continuation of protec- 
tion being all that is required, the litter need 
not be removed until the plants are breaking 
through the surface. 

March. — The beds may now have the sun, 
and all the air if there be no frost ; but must 
have the litter replaced on doubtful evenings, 
lest a frost should come on in the night. As 
soon as they are well up the earth should be 
stirred between the roots, the compost being 
well crumbled and laid close round the stems. 

April. — The flowers will be developing 
themselves rapidly if the spring has been mild, 
and the past winter genial. Before the flowers 
are opened warm showers will be beneficial ; 
afterwards they would only damage the bloom. 
The main roots will continue in bloom a long 
time, if carefully shaded. The offset buds 
must be looked to, and the pips reduced on 
each spike to one or two of the top ones ; so 
also must seedlings that are beginning to 
flower. Younger seedlings, as well as the beds 
generally, must be carefully weeded. 

May. — When the bloom has passed the per- 
fection sufficiently to be no longer appreciated 
for show, the coverings of every description 
must be taken off, but until then the sun ought 
never to shine on the open flowers. An arid 
sun and moderate rain are however desirable 
for the perfecting of the bulbs. Keep every 
thing clear of weeds. Mark any seedlings 
that are likely to be useful as additions to the 
present varieties. 

June. — This month the foliage will in 
general decay enough to allow of the bulbs to 
be taken up and placed in the shade to dry ; 
those however which are seeding will not be 
so far advanced, they will keep growing until 
the seed is almost ripe ; of course there must 
be exceptions in favour of such plants. We 
have seen nearly every flower in a bed seed, 
and the plants keep growing, till a late period ; 
but if seed is not desired, the pips of bloom 
should be picked off as soon as the cloth is 
removed, or the other coverings taken away. 

July. — This month they will have dried 



'220 



THE NARCISSUS. 



sufficiently to be deprived of their decayed 
foliage and stems, and be placed in bags. 
Seeds may be gathered of such as are standing 
out, and the bulbs taken up as soon afterwards 
as the leaves die down. 

August. — Turn out all the compost from 
the beds, and lay it in ridges on each side, to 
be turned over occasionally to sweeten. 

September. — Examine your bulbs and sort 
them for planting. Never plant a doubtful 
one in the best bed, as it is obvious that in an 
arrangement so uniform, a missed bloom or a 
decayed plant would be a great eyesore. 

October. — Sow seed as directed. Plant 
the best bed and all out beds and offset beds : 
if there be any reason for keeping bulbs out 
of the ground, a month is no object, but this 
month is the best : from this time all the beds, 
but especially seedlings, and beds of seed, must 
at any cost be kept clear of weeds. 

November. — Plant whatever may have 
been left out of ground until now, and sow 
seed if not done already. Cover the seedlings 
and small offset beds with litter. 

December. — Repeat the November treat- 
ment all through. 

properties op the hyacinth. 

Some of these are already appreciated a little, 
but none sufficiently distinct. There are a 
few of the present varieties which have long 
spikes of flowers, and those very compact — 
both of which are desirable — but they for the 
most part have very ill-shaped pips. There 
are others which have very prettily formed 
pips, of a great size, but they are far apart on 
the spike, and some hang awkwardly ; and 
those who exhibit the flower, know but little 
as to what caprice is to decide their fate ; but 
as the time when the flower can be seen forced 
has arrived, and the period for showing in pots 
is approaching, we take the opportunity of 
defining a little the properties which should be 
esteemed ; as nearly all the points have been 



attained in different flowers, there is every 
reason to hope, that as soon as we persevere in 
raising seedlings in this country, and force 
the Dutch to follow the example, we shall 
make rapid advances toward obtaining several 
properties in the same flower. We commence 
with the pip. 

Each pip or flower should be round and not 
ragged. The petals should be broad, thick, 
blunt at the ends, not pointed, and reflex 
enough to throw up the centre well. The foot 
stalk should be strong, and hold the flower out 
stiff in a vertical position, that is, facing the 
spectator, and by no means weak, to allow the 
pip to hang with the face sloping toward the 
ground. The foot stalks should also be of a 
length, to make the pips touch each other and 
no more. The pips should be large, for unless 
the pips be large they cannot touch each other 
without very short foot stalks, and the flowers 
would be so close to the stem, that the truss 
itself would be no size. Double flowers should 
have the rows of petals above each other very 
regulaidy imbricated, so as to throw up the 
centre. The outer petals, therefore, of a double 
flower need not reflex, and should not reflex 
so much as a single one, because the centre is 
raised by the second and third rows of petals. 

The spike should be bold, round, compact, 
and pyramidal, with a number of flowers 
at the bottom, gradually diminishing to a 
single flower at the top. The flower stem 
should be very strong and upright, and no 
part of it should be seen from the lowest 
flowers to the top, in consequence of the close- 
ness of the pips to each other. 

The colours should be bright, clear, and 
dense, whatever the shade ; and any better 
approach to scarlet, blue, or yellow, than those 
shades we now possess, would be highly 
esteemed : flowers with dark eyes, very clear 
outsides, and those with striped petals, would 
be held to be better than selfs in general, but 
would give no point against form. 



GLENNY ON THE NARCISSUS. 



The Narcissus is one of the most lovely of 
our spring flowers. The perfume is more 
powerful than that of most other flowers ; and 
if there are too many in a room, it will affect 
any weakly person. It appears a powerful 
narcotic, and will give even robust persons a 
slight headache. The varieties most esteemed 
are those which bloom in large clusters. Both 
the yellow and white are esteemed, and many 
thousands are annually imported from Hol- 
land, and are grown as well in the common 
borders as in pots and glasses. They make a 
pretty display among the early spring flowers, 
and there are many different varieties which 



group well. The best possible effect can be 
produced by them in wildernesses, in large 
rough borders, clumps, and geometrical gar- 
dens. The soil in which they succeed best is 
rich and light, but they will grow in any- 
thing, from sand to stiff clay. In light rich 
soil the bulbs do not deteriorate, and the off- 
sets may be grown up to maturity very soon, 
and they may be raised from seed without 
any difficulty. But the culture is so like 
that of the hyacinth, that we need only repeat 
the directions in full, if we desired to go into 
details. 

There is a difference between the mode of 



THE NARCISSUS. 



221 



growing for the sake of stock and growing 
for bloom. Those "who grow for stock should 
take up the bulbs every season, and remove 
the offsets, to be planted out till they come to 
maturity ; even these are taken up every 
year, and kept out of ground some time to 
rest, and then planted again at the proper 
season, sufficiently far apart to enable them to 
swell and become good round bulbs. On the 
other hand, those who wish merely for quan- 
tity of bloom let them remain in their borders 



or beds three years. There is then quite as 
much increase, but the roots, from being close 
together and not having room to swell, be- 
come unsightly, and would not in a general 
way do for market ; for the greater portion 
of those imported or brought to market in 
spring are for blooming in glasses, which ex- 
pose the entire bulb ; and if not handsome, 
for this purpose they would be unsaleable. 
The varieties which bloom with handsome 
trusses of many flowers are commonly called 




polyanthus narcissus ; but there are many 
that flower with a single bloom, others with 
two or three. The colours simply vary from 
yellow to white, some being yellow with a 
deeper coloured cup, almost orange coloui% 
others are white with yellow cups ; some are 
double, others single ; some pure white — 
indeed, one is called the paper white, and 
exceedingly pretty it is. Upon the whole, 
the numerous varieties of the narcissus form 
a beautiful group, and will bloom in any way 
that the ordinary spring bulbs will flower. 
For this reason we have placed it among them 
in the following paper on the many ways of 
flowering the spring bulbs, such as hyacinths, 
crocuses, tulips, and others, which will do 
well under the same treatment. 

PROPERTIES OF THE NARCISSUS. 

The great variety of this beautiful spring 
flower would almost seem to defy us to lay 
down general rules, yet there is no more diffi- 



culty in imagining what would be the most 
beautiful than there is in any other of the 
numerous families for which we have already 
provided models of perfection. 

It is very true that some narcissus have 
only a single flower, others a large bunch — 
some are white, others yellow — some have 
narrow petals, others broad — but all are 
pointed. The only varieties, however, calcu- 
lated for florists or show flowers, are those 
which have bunches or heads of flowers, and 
a few necessary qualities would render them 
beautiful objects. 

First. — The flowers should be circular and 
large. 

Second. — They should expand flat, and 
the cup which is in the centre should stand 
out well. 

Third. — The petals should be thick, smooth, 
firm, free from notch or roughness on the 
edges, and have no points. 



222 



THE HYACINTH, NARCISSUS, &C. 



Fourth. — The bunch of flowers should not 
consist of less than seven ; the foot-stalks 
should be of such length as to allow the 
flowers to touch each other at the edge, and 
present an even, though rounding, or dome- 
like surface, with one bloom in the middle, 
the other six forming a circle round it. 

Fifth. — The stem should be strong, firm, 
elastic, and not more than ten inches in length. 
The leaves should be short, broad, and bright, 
and there must not be more than one flower- 
stem to a show flower. 

Sixth. — If the variety be white, it should 
be pure ; and the yellow cup should be bright. 
If the variety be yellow, it cannot be too 
bright. 

Double flowers, and narcissus of numerous 
kinds, with only one or two flowers in a sheath, 
will not be considered subjects of exhibition, 
except in collections of forced flowers. 

GENERAL REMARKS ON THE HYACINTH, THE 

NARCISSUS, AND BULBS IN GENERAL. 

There is so much similarity in the manage- 
ment required for the hyacinth and narcissus, 
that they ought almost to be coupled, as are 
carnations and picotees. As there is not the 
diversity of colour in the narcissus that we 
have in the hyacinth, there is no temptation 
to grow them in beds ; in all other respects, 
whether from seed, from offsets, or in grow- 
ing matured imported bulbs, the management 
is the same. But we have left a large field 
untouched as regards the different modes of 
growing the hyacinth, and confined ourselves 
to the out-of-door treatment ; and reserved 
what we have to say of forcing and house 
growing for bulbs in general, such as the 
early kinds of tulips, the narcissus, the hya- 
cinth, the crocus, and other subjects, that we 

ay treat them all alike. 

Of the many ways in which a bulb may be 
grown, the most common are the following : — 
in water, in pots of mould, in wet sand, and 
in moss : all of these are well in their way, 
but for elegance give us moss ; for ease, 
water ; for a make-shift, sand ; and for the 
sake of the bulbs themselves, pots of mould. 

IN WATER. 

Fill up the glasses till the bottom of the 
bulb will touch it, and constantly fill up the 
glass as the bulb absorbs it. The custom of 
putting them in the dark has become very 
prevalent ; but experiments which have been 
tried, purposely to test the advantage derived 
from this plan, give no indication of its supe- 
riority. The narcissus, hyacinth, crocus, and 
early tulip, all grow well in water ; and some 
that we have seen placed in a strong light 
from the first, have proved as strong and per- 
fect as a similar number placed three or four 
weeks in the dark. The notion entertained 



is, that the roots should be developed before 
the growth of the foliage begins ; and that, 
in the dark, the roots grow, but the foliage 
does not advance materially. We have not 
found this to be the case, although we have, 
until the present season, acted upon the sug- 
gestion. River water or rain water is far 
better than water from a well, and we have 
changed it every three weeks, though filling 
it up as it is absorbed by the roots will do. 
We have invariably objected to putting any- 
thing in the water, although we have seen it 
done by many, for we have never seen any- 
thing gained in colour, strength, or size of 
flowers. 

IN WET SAND. 

This has no other recommendation than 
the saving of trouble as compared with water, 
among those persons who fancied it necessary 
to be always changing it ; and we feel quite 
convinced that the plants do not grow so 
strong in it as they do in water or mould. 
It has one advantage — its weight, which tends 
to steady the glasses or vases in which the 
flowers are bloomed. It is, indeed, easy to 
conceive that where a vessel is filled with 
sand, which contains no nourishing qualities 
whatever, the plant may exhaust the fertiliz- 
ing qualities of the water soon, because these 
must necessarily be a very small quantity ; 
and although it may be filled up as often as 
necessary, and be kept full, all the nourishing 
properties in a small quantity must be much 
less than if the whole bulk were water. There 
is, however, so much in the bulb itself, that 
the flower and leaves will develop themselves 
with a very little assistance. Nevertheless, 
there is a vast difference in the strength of a 
plant fully nourished and one starved by a 
limited supply. 

IN WET MOSS. 

This medium, properly prepared, and in a 
proper vessel, will be found both effective and 
pretty. Suppose it to be a flower-pot — the 
hole at the bottom should be stopped ; but 
the wet moss enables us to grow bulbs in 
almost any shaped utensil : a punchbowl, a 
salad-bowl, a deep dish, basin, or jar will do. 
A little sand at the bottom, and the moss 
pressed down level with the edge, will be 
sufficient ; the bulbs are then placed on the 
surface, and rather pressed in than otherwise. 
If the vessel be large enough to hold half a 
dozen or a dozen things, the centre may be a 
narcissus, round this six hyacinths, round the 
hyacinths a row of early Van Thol tulips, 
and outside of all a row of crocuses of the 
three different colours ; or, as the tulips are 
inclined to yellow, perhaps blue and white 
alternately will do better. The moss is to be 
wetted well, and fine green picked moss should 
be piled up all over the bulbs, which may be

223 



completely hidden by it. This might be done 
in a large punch or salad-bowl, or round dish, 
or glass milkpan. Smaller vessels may be 
used with single bulbs, or with two or three, 
or more. The moss in which they are placed 
should be pressed down, and need not be of 
the finest colour ; but that put at top, form- 
ing a rounding surface, and covering the 
bulbs, ought to be of the best colour, and the 
handsomest that could be picked ; for the 
moss is of itself a pretty object, even before 
the bulbs throw up their green foliage. Those 
who prefer to see the bulbs may merely put 
some of the best moss between them, and not 
enough to cover them. 

IN POTS. 

It is the practice to pot bulbs close to or 
above the surface, to place them all under a 
heap of ashes, or sawdust, or sand, to be 
taken out as they are wanted for forcing. It 
is far better to obtain the pots made on pur- 
pose, twice the height of an ordinary pot, and 
to put the bulb on the soil with the pot only 
half filled ; then fill up the pot so that a good 
three or four inches of compost is above the 
bulb : these may be plunged in the open 
ground, and covered with litter. The plant 
begins growing directly ; and when required 
for forcing from time to time, they only want 
to be placed in heat a little earlier, to make 
allowance for the time they are coming through 
the earth ; and all the later ones, instead of 
having three or four inches of yellow foliage, 
which has been drawn up through the ashes 
or sawdust, or other medium in which they 
have been buried, will be found hardly through 
the compost, or, if through, by no means 
drawn up. This applies to all the hardy 
bulbs that are capable of being grown in pots. 
The soil should be the same as has been re- 
commended for beds ; and the only care 
required is that of supplying water, so that 
the soil should never be dry ; but, as there is 
real nourishment in the soil, it must not be 
saturated with water always ; on the con- 
trary, the treatment should be much the same 
as other potted plants, such as geraniums, 
which ought to be kept moist, but never wet. 
The pots should always be in a strong light, 
and, until the flowers show colour, may have 
as much sun as possible, and air in mild wea- 
ther, unless they are in forcing heat, which 
of course renders this improper. For forcing, 
the bulbs may be potted as early as Septem- 
ber, and may be placed in heat at once ; and 
from that time till the end of December, they 
may be potted with pretty nearly as good 
success ; but some bulbs are weakened by 
keeping out till that time, and others, even of 
the same varieties, may be picked out that 
stand very well. We prefer on every account 



potting early, and plunging the pots to their 
rims in the ordinary ground, merely covering 
with litter, to keep off the frost in case of a 
severe one. From this situation they can 
be taken to force as they are likely to be 
wanted ; and they make far more handsome 
plants when so treated than they do when 
buried in anything ; and the two or three 
inches' growth is above instead of under the 
surface. 

It only remains for us to name a few of the 
best and cheapest for the different purposes, 
always premising that every kind will grow 
well in pots, but that some do better than 
others in glasses.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAY. 




THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 

Sow beans, beet, borecole, brocoli, cabbage, 
carrot, cauliflower, celery, chervil, cress, en- 
dive, herbs, kidney beans, lettuce, mustard, 
peas, radishes, spinach, scarlet runners, turnip, 
and vegetable marrow. 

Plant and Transplant artichokes, asparagus, 
basil, cabbage, capsicums, cauliflowers, celery, 
kidney beans, leek, lettuce, love apple, onions, 
parsley, potato, New Zealand spinach, sea kale, 
and Swedish turnip. 

General Directions. — Clear, trench, and 
then dung and dig the ground for the winter 
crops, as brocoli, Brussels sprouts, &c. Bear 
in mind the necessity of systematic rotation ; 
that is, repeat not the same crop nor any of 
its allies on the same soil, but rather substitute 
plants as different in constitution as possible : 
for instance, any of the Brassica tribe may 
come after Legumes, but brocoli should not 
follow cauliflowers, nor peas beans, and so on. 
It is commendable, especially in small gardens, 
to intermix the crops, that is, to plant or sow 
the taller crops, such as kidney beans, or peas, 
so wide apart as to admit of two or three 
rows of cabbage or lettuce being introduced 
between them. This will be found beneficial 
for all, by admitting the light and air more 
freely, by which abundant and healthy crops 
will be realized. Attend in due time to thin- 
ning and pricking out seedling plants ; and 



hoeing and stirring the soil after rains. Keep 
down slugs, by sowing fresh slaked lime over 
the garden late at night or early in the morn- 
ing ; decoy them and other vermin by laying 
down broad pieces of wood, slate, greased 
leaves, handfuls of seeds, &c. ; dust over all 
the seed beds with wood ashes, soot, &c. 
Water every thing that is transplanted, unless 
the planting is succeeded by a good rain, which 
is best. 

Artichokes (Globe) may yet be planted 
from strong suckers ; the sooner the better. 

Asparagus newly planted, should be mulched 
and watered with manure and salted water ; it 
may yet be transplanted. Some prefer to thin 
out the young plants where sown, but this 
should not be done unless the ground was tho- 
roughly prepared. When cutting from the 
established beds, do it so as to thin the plants 
evenly according to their strength. 

Basil, — Plant out on a warm spot, say one 
row along the bottom of the south wall, or in 
rows fourteen inches apart, and eight between ; 
keep some in pots under glass. 

Beans. — If much in request make another 
planting ; top them when in flower : it is 
questionable whether there is much benefit 
derived from earthing up, but to hoe and clean 
the soil well is certainly beneficial. 

Beet for pickling, does not require a very 
rich soil ; sow these at ten inches apart. Sow 
the main winter crop ; the white Silesian beet 
is excellent : allow eighteen inches between 
the rows. 

Borecole, which includes the various kales, 
may be sown now ; and as these are among

the most hardy of vegetable?, it may be well 
to sow largely. Prick out those sown last 
month. 

Urocoli. — Prick the plants out from the 
former sowing, and make another ; put the 
best plants by themselves, at wider distances 
than the smaller ones. 

Brussels sprouts. — Prick out, and make 
provision to plant a considerable quantity. 

Cabbages. — Again plant out at eighteen 
inches asunder ; and sow a few more : divest 
those which are cut, of their under leaves, 
and allow them to stand to produce a crop of 
sprouts ; if these are thinned to one or two, 
they will make tolerable heads. 

Capsicums. — Plant out a few of these from 
the pots along the south wall, or on a very 
warm border, about the middle of the month ; 
keep the ball unbroken. 

Carrots may still be sown early : in stiff 
soils, make holes with a dibble, fill with fine 
soil, and drop in the seed : thin the main 
crops to eight inches apart ; the other sowings 
may be left thicker. 

Cauliflowers. — Root out as soon as the 
heads are cut, and pull up at once all that 
button ; remove the stumps to the rubbish heap 
to rot, or reserve them for charring. Prick out 
a fresh batch of young plants, and also sow 
and plant out permanently a few more. 

Celery. — Prick out into a very rich soil, 
and water, and shade them for a few days : 
hoop them over so as to facilitate covering 
from frost if requisite ; water slightly with 
liquid manure. Towards the end of the 
month, the March sowing will be ready to 
plant out ; prepare trenches for that purpose, 
say ten inches deep, two feet wide, and six 
feet between ; the latter space is convenient 
for lettuces or any light crop : put in the 
trenches six inches of well-rotted manure, 
(some prefer it green or fresh,) dig it in, and 
plant two rows in each trench at ten inches 
apart. 

Chervil. — This requires to be sown every 
month when it is much required : it will grow 
almost anywhere, and with little trouble. 

Cress. — Sow twice or oftener this month, 
choosing rather a shady place ; use a slight 
covering to hasten germination. 

Endive. — Sow a little towards the end of 
the month, in a rich, open, and warm place. 

Jlerbs may yet be put in either by seeds or 
cuttings, and as soon as possible. 

Kidney beans. — Plant out those raised under 
glass about the middle of the month. The 
seeds may be put in at the same distance, viz. 
four inches in the row, and eighteen between ; 
or what is better, set the rows four feet apart, 
and plant cabbages between. 

Leeks. — Plant out in rows fifteen inches 
apart and twelve in the rows ; give them a 
48. 



strongly manured soil ; raise up the plants 
with a fork ; the tips of the leaves and roots 
are taken off, to expedite the planting. 

Lettuce. — Sow a few more ; and plant also 
successionally, a foot apart each way. 

Love apple, or Tomatoes. — Plant out against 
a south wall ; keep the ball unbroken and nail 
up the plants : the middle of the month will 
do. 

Mustard- — If the weather is warm, sow in 
a shady situation, where it keeps longer in a 
young state. Sow twice or oftener. 

Onion. — Thin to four or five inches, and 
transplant a few in showery weather ; clean 
thoroughly. 

Parsley may be transplanted if done with 
care ; take only the curled plants ; also when 
thinning attend to this; leave it at from four to 
six inches distant. 

Potatoes may still be planted in moderation ; 
do not dung strongly nor cut any of the sets ; 
work the soil well, and plant at three feet 
apart, and one foot in the row : hoe between, 
but do not earth up the advancing crops too 
early. 

Peas. — Sow about once a fortnight ; stake 
early, and according to their respective heights; 
top the tall growers frequently. 

New Zealand Spinach. — A few plants of 
this may be planted out now ; it will be found 
useful. 

Radishes. — If ground is scanty, drop in a 
few seeds among any of the other crops ; sow 
twice this month. 

Scarlet runners. — Sow now ; place them so 
as to screen other crops ; they are quite orna- 
mental. 

Sea Kale. — Thin out the buds to about 
three within a square of six inches, and water 
with salted water, say two ounces to a gallon 
of water. 

Spinach. — It is common to sow it between 
every sowing of peas ; have it always well 
thinned ; sow now in a cool place. 

Swedish Turnip. — This excellent sort should 
be grown as a reseiwe in case of a failui'e in 
the potato ; it is the only kind that bears 
transplanting well ; give it a light, richly-ma- 
nured, and well-w r rought soil ; plant in rows 
twenty inches apart, and the plants a foot 
asunder. 

Turnips. — Put in the mr.in sowing about 
the middle of the month ; thin the early ones 
to eight inches. 

Vegetable Harrow. — Plant out from the 
frames under hand lights to remain for a time ; 
and if they are planted on beds below which 
is a little fermenting material, it is all the 
better. 

THE FKUIT GARDEN. 

General directions. — It is scarcely neces- 
Q

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAT. 



sary to observe that a thorough, and universal 
hoeing will, independent of other advantages, 
tend much to keep this and every department 
out of doors free of weeds. Look over the 
grafts, and loosen the ties if necessary ; they 
must not be entirely removed. Disbudding, 
and thinning the fruit, with keeping the trees 
dean, will be the principal operations. 

Apples. — Caterpillars will now make sad 
ravages if timely " hand picking" is not 
attended to : when the fruit is fairly set, give 
all a good syringing in the morning with soap 
suds. Thin and give the same kind of atten- 
tion to standards, that is given to the wall 
trees ; they will equally compensate for it. 

Apricots. — Thin, and disbud gradually ; 
remove any nails likely to come in contact 
with the swelling fruits ; syringe occasionally. 

Cherries. — Towards the middle of the 
month,, give a final thinning of wood and fruit 
according to the state of the tree ; fasten in 
the shoots which w r ill bear it. Syringing will 
be necessary if the weather is dry and warm, 
and do it always early. 

Currants. — Keep the ground clean by 
hoeing : if caterpillars appear, dust the bushes 
when damp with white hellebore powder. 

Figs. — No thinning of the fruit is usually 
required, excepting of those which were too 
forward last autumn. Give a good syringing 
before the leaves cover the wall ; the cobwebs 
and filth are very injurious. Thin the young 
shoots moderately ; and top them when six 
inches long. 

Gooseberries. — On dewy mornings dust over 
the bushes with white hellebore powder ; this 
will kill and prevent the caterpillars : where 
very fine fruit is wanted, go over now, and 
thin out the small ones. 

Nectarines, where they have not broken 
well at the points, may be cut back to the 
nearest good bud ; thin gradually, and syringe 
occasionally at the appearance of insects : 
allow a slight protection, (from cutting winds 
and frosts,) to remain a little longer. 

Peaches. — Thin the shoots, taking away all 
the misplaced and diseased ones first ; the 
lowermost bud on the upper side of the shoot, 
is usually left for next year's bearing wood ; 
more if required further along the shoots : 
thin the fruit, removing the small and bad 
ones first. Syringe with clear water, and 
then with tobacco liquid, to kill the green fly. 
Part of the protection afforded to the blossoms 
may be retained till the middle of the month. 

Pears. — Rub off the foreright shoots, and 
many of the deformed and overcrowded fruits. 

Plums. — Attend to thinning the young 
shoots and fruit, which in all cases is to be done 
gradually, and as it were by constant attention — 
not neglecting it for a time, and then thinning 
severely, which is very hurtful to all trees. 



Strawberries. — Hoe immediately, and cut 
away all runners appearing, unless required 
for young plants. Mulch the plants with dry 
litter, as straw or hay ; spent hops is preferable 
to any other mulching, when they can be got. 

Vines. — Divest the trees of all superfluous 
shoots ; and before and whilst in bloom a 
slight protection at night is desirable. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General directions. — An increase of air, 
and a slight decrease of water will now be the 
leading features of importance, of course vary- 
ing according to circumstances. Fruit wanted 
verj'- early, may be obtained so, by keeping the 
apartment closer than the flavour of the fruit 
would warrant ; only this sacrifice may be of 
less consequence at the time. 

Apricots. — Temperature, 75 degrees by da} r , 
and 55 degrees by night. They are not much 
forced, although there is no good reason why 
they should not be ; withhold the water gradu- 
ally, both in damping, syringing, and at the 
roots ; and when they commence to colour, 
withhold it altogether ; give air both night and 
day as the weather allows. 

Cherries. — Temperature, 65 to 70 degrees 
by day, and 50 degrees by night. In many 
cases the sashes may be let down at full length, 
and remain so unless wet or very cold. Give 
no water, as the fruit should soon be ripe, and 
must be very carefully gathered. Nail in, or 
cut away all the straggling shoots, and give 
the benefit of the sun as much as practicable. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature, from 80 degrees 
to 90 degrees by day, and from 65 to 70 at 
night. Always maintain a moist atmosphere ; 
water most in the mornings, yet seldom over 
the leaves. Fumigate gently and often for 
green fly. Thin those in rapid growth daily ; 
impregnate those required for seed ; shut all 
up early in the afternoon ; do not overburden 
the plants, two and three good fruit at a time 
on a plant, is sufficient. 

Figs.- — Temperature, 70 degrees to 75 by 
day, and 60 degrees at night. Stop all the 
shoots at from six to nine inches long : de- 
crease the moisture when there are many ripe. 
Those in pots may be removed to another 
house, and, after a short rest, started again for 
another crop ; but if there are plenty on the 
walls, this will not be prudent : handle the 
fruit very gently, and lay it in a cool place 
until wanted. 

Kidney beans. — Temperature, 70 degrees to 
80 degrees, by day, and 60 to 65 degrees at 
night. Syringe often, as red spider is apt to 
make progress ; maintain a moist heat ; water 
does more injury to the flowers than the beans. 
Apply liquid manure as the apparent vigour 
of the plant may determine. 

Mehns. — Temperature, from 80 to 90 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAY. 



227 



degrees by day, and 70 to 75 degrees at night. 
Water less as the fruit ripens ; do not water 
over the foliage ; always shut up early. When 
the fruit gives out a smell, leave a little air at 
night ; and when cracking around the shank, 
it is generally ready to be cut. The succession 
crops must be kept thin of vine ; two or three 
fruit is enough on each plant. It is safer to 
impregnate always. If the old plants are in 
a healthful state, cut them back after the fruit 
is gathered ; apply a little water and heat, and 
a good second crop will often be obtained : 
very little artificial heat is now required, if due 
advantage is taken of sun heat. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature, from 55 to 60 
degrees. This is a good time to make up 
fresh beds ; give air freely, and keep the house 
dark ; very little water will now suffice. 

3Iusas. — Temperature, 75 degrees at night, 
and from 80 to 90 degrees by day. When a 
considerable number of the fruits are well 
swollen, decrease the amount of water gra- 
dually, but at no time allow these, or any 
plants, to be so dry as to flag. 

Nectarines. — Temperature, 75 to 80 degrees 
by day, and 55 to 60 at night, as before. 
Finish the tying, &c, of the early house. 
Give more air as they begin to colour, and 
leave a portion also at night, when the fruit is 
nearly ripe : if red spider appears, slightly 
sulphur the flues when cold. 

Peaches. — Temperature, 75 to 80 degrees 
by day, and 55 to 60 at night. A thorough 
syringing should be given before they begin to 
colour. Give plenty of air, as with nectarines. 
In the later houses, continue to water, disbud, 
thin, and tie in. 

Pine apples. — Temperature, from 80 to 90 
degrees by day, and 70 degrees at night ; shut 
up with a sun heat of 95 degrees. Shade 
slightly the lately shifted plants in each de- 
partment, and aim by keeping up the moisture 
and warmth, with air, to have a " sturdy and 
quick growth." Withhold water from those 
which are ripening ; the suckers may remain 
on for a time, whether they are to be grown 
on the old or new system. Give a little air to 
all at night. 

Strawberries. — Temperature, 65 degrees by 
da} r , and 55 degrees at night : it is almost too 
warm to have these in a house where there is 
much artificial heat ; keep them near the heat 
recommended. « 

Vinery. — Temperature, 80 degrees by day, 
and from 60 to 65 degrees at night. Avoid 
currents of air, and sudden transitions, both as 
regards moisture, and in every other respect. 
The late houses must be kept warmest, and the 
atmosphere somewhat dry, a little before, at 
the time of, and after flowering and setting. 
Thin the branches and wood early, and by 
degrees : when tying, do not strain the shoot 



much at first, and never tie tight. Allow 
young vines when once stopped, to ramble 
awhile. 

FLOWER GARDEN AND SHRUBBERY. 

Sow a little of every thing worth keeping 
up a succession of, as hardy, and half-hardy 
annuals, biennials, and perennials. 

Plant and transplant all those raised in 
heat, after being hardened off*; also all the 
green-house and bedding-out plants. 

General directions. — This is a busy month, 
both physically and mentally. Plant out the 
tender and half-hardy bedding plants towards 
the end of the month, and let the most tender, 
such as dahlias, and heliotropes be put out 
last. In arranging them, the coloured plan 
studied and prepared in the winter months, 
will be found of great service. In planting out, 
attend to producing a contrast of colour, that 
is, place the most different colours together, 
or in contiguous beds. If the beds are of 
moderate size, it is best to fill them with one 
colour : or a very good effect is produced by 
introducing a belt of some distinct colour. 
Thus, for example, against or next to blue, 
(say salvias,) plant yellow, (such as calceola- 
rias) : next to crimson, (say verbena,) plant 
light blue, (as nemophila.) Where the figures 
are on gravel, surround or edge them with a 
cold colour, as blue, or even green ; when 
upon turf, surround them with a warm colour, 
as yellow or white. Give them all a soaking 
with water after planting, and it may be well 
to form a basin around a few of those turned 
out of pots. Finally, harden off all the store 
plants : finish propagating. Hoe the shrub- 
beries again ; those shrubs which have been 
lately transplanted, should be mulched again 
and watered. 

Alpines. — Keep the pots plunged nearly to 
the rim among coal ashes, in a cool shady place ; 
they then dry less rapidly, and do not so often 
suffer from drought as when more exposed ; 
have them regularly watered. Propagate any 
scarce kinds. 

American plants. — As soon as the flowers 
of any of these, such as rhododendrons or 
azaleas, are faded, have them all cut off", re- 
moving the whole of the seed-vessels, stalks 
and all. By this means, the energies of the 
plants, which would have been expended on the 
useless seed-vessels, go towards forming blos- 
som buds for another season. Of course, none 
of the leaves, nor any of the growing buds 
which push out just below the bunches of 
flowers, are to be taken away. 

Anemones when in bloom must be shaded ; 
and if the weather is dry, all the beds will re- 
quire water. As soon as the flowers are over, 
if the room is wanted for other plants, take 
them up carefully, and plant them in the re- 
serve garden.

GARDENING CALENDAR TOR MAY. 



Annuals. — Sow, plant, and thin out ; stick 
a few neat sturdy twigs amongst them, by 
which they will be supported ; this is better 
for many things than tying. 

Auriculas. — Where seed is wanted, set apart 
a few selected plants by themselves, and care- 
fully impregnate them. From the rest of the 
blooming plants remove the decaying blossoms 
as soon as they begin to fade, that they may 
not exhaust the plants ; in doing this, simply 
pick off the individual flowers, but do not cut 
away the main stalk until it is quite decayed. 
After the bloom is past, give the plants 
abundance of air. 

Carnations. — "Water, stake, and thin the 
stems of the show sorts ; sow seed. 

Chrysanthemums. — Much may be done with 
these ; plant out a quantity to take layers from 
in July. Plant any spare plants in the shrub- 
bery borders ; give manure abundantly. 

Clematis, and other climbing plants, both 
deciduous and evergreen, as they advance into 
vigorous growth, should have the branches 
thinned, and those that are retained, properly 
supported according to the position they 
occupy : this attention, which is commonly 
bestowed upon rarer plants, will not be lost on 
the more common ones, such as those here 
referred to. 

Dahlias. — Harden off, and plant out at the 
end of the month ; prepare a rich soil to flower 
them in ; but of the very choice sorts, plant 
some on poor soil, as it will be found that 
stimulated roots are the worst keepers ; they 
require much water. 

Fuchsias. — Thin out the young shoots ; 
train some as bushes, but they are most 
handsome trained to one stem or so. Clear 
away all protecting material, and dress the 
soil about them. 

Hyacinths. — Shade the beds when the 
bloom is expanded : pick off the flowers as 
they fade, that the energies of the roots may 
not be expended in seeding. If the ground is 
wanted for other plants where they are grow- 
ing, take them up carefully soon after the 
bloom is past, and lay them in, in the reserve 
garden, to complete their growth. 

Lawns. — The beauty of a lawn depends 
very much upon frequent mowing, especially 
early in the season ; they ought now to be cut 
twice a month at the least — if oftener, so much 
the better. Roll them before mowing, and 
sweep up the cut grass quite clean. 

Lobelias. — The large growing herbaceous 
varieties should be separated in March, each 
single crown being planted in a small pot. and 
set in a warm frame till it has started, and 
then hardened off: they are to be shifted 
once or twice ; and early in this month may 
be planted out in rich soil in a moist situa- 
tion, wh^re they become very fine. They are 



very ornamental on the margins of akes. 
Some may be placed in large pots of rich loam, 
and are very ornamental to set near fountains, 
or in any cool situation ; they require plenty 
of water. 

Jlimulus. — The varieties grown for beds 
must be planted in a cool moist situation : they 
all have a fine appearance on the margin of a 
lake. 

Narcissus. — Shade the best beds whilst in 
bloom, and remove the flowers as they fade. 
Take up the roots, as with hyacinths, if the 
ground is wanted. 

Pansies. Give liberal waterings in hot 
weather ; adding a little weak liquid manure 
once a week ; propagate by the side shoots 
planted under a hand light, and shade them ; 
they will also root in a cool shady place 
without covering. 

JPicotees. — Thin and support the flower 
stems, but do not tie tight ; w^ater freely in 
the morning, yet very cautiously. 

Pinks. — Of the prize varieties, thin the 
stems to one, and leave only three buds upon 
it ; water with liquid manure, w r eekly. 

Pinus. — Plant out any seedlings which ai'e 
intended for planting out ; do not place any 
manure about them, and have the ground 
beneath well drained. If any of the half 
hardy kinds are planted out, they might be put 
in a group, where they could be covered all 
together during winter. 

Polyanthus in pots and past flower should 
be again planted out and divided, if worth 
increasing. 

Roses. — Thin out the weak and over 
crowded shoots, and propagate from them ; 
remove all suckers and side shoots from those 
budded last year, and suckers and useless shoots 
from the stocks. Water with liquid manure, 
sparingly at first. 

Stocks. — Plant out, if not already done ; 
the later ones will do yet, to flower in autumn. 

Sweet Peas. — Lose no time in staking these, 
whether in rows or patches. Sow a few more 
to bloom late. 

Tigridias. — Plant out those started in pots 
into beds of light sandy soil. Others may be 
planted out at once for succession. Their 
ephemeral flowers have a very good effect 
from the number which is produced in suc- 
cession. 

Tulips. — Screen from the sun and cutting 
winds by canvas awning ; if it is made to give 
room to walk under it is the more desirable, 
as the flowers can be inspected with the greater 
comfort. Break off the seed vessels when the 
flowers are past. 

Violets must be watered if very dry ; and 
if young plants are not already taken off, do it 
soon, and encourage them by planting on rich 
open ground. They must be potted in autumn. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAY

Wallflowers. Propagate a large supply of 
the double varieties by cuttings, under hand 
glasses, in sandy loam. Too many of these 
can hardly be obtained. The clear yellow, 
dark brown, and purple double varieties are 
very distinct and handsome. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

The plants, especially those in flower, should 
be shaded from the too powerful action of the 
sun in the middle of the day. Maintain a 
free circulation of air, and keep the plants as 
fully exposed to light as possible. As the 
weather becomes warm and dusty, the plants 
should be regularly syringed, or they may be 
well drenched over head about once a week or 
oftener in hot weather, and any dust or other 
defect not removed by this means must be 
washed or picked off by hand. Stake and tie 
every plant neatly as soon as supports become 
necessary, using as few sticks to a plant as 
possible, never more than one if it can be 
avoided. 

Bulbs, such as hyacinths. &c. will be nearly 
out of bloom ; such as are still in flower should 
be kept in a cool shady situation to prolong 
their duration. Cyclamen persicum, and some 
of its varieties, will still be in bloom, and 
should have a careful but regular supply of 
water. 

Begonias will require an increased supply 
of moisture as they advance ; they should be 
shifted into larger pots if large specimens are 
wanted. 

Camellias. — Water freely as the season ad- 
vances ; keep them warm, but do not expose 
them to the midday sun ; keep the leaves very 
clean by syringing, or hand washing, if the first 
means be not effectual. 

Cinerarias, as they go out of flower, may 
be parted and repotted ; place them in a shady 
corner, and water regularly. 

Fuchsias. — Thin out weak or ill placed 
shoots, shift them where necessary, and water 
freely ; use manure water about once a week, 
not oftener. 

Geraniums. — Carefully shade those in 
flower ; cut out the stamens of every flower 
as it opens — they will then last a day or two 
longer ; water regularly and copiously. 

JUyrtles and other evergreens will now be 
growing freely ; water frequently, and keep 
the leaves very clean ; stand them in a light 
but sheltered situation. 

Roses. — Water regularly, and occasionally 
with manure water. Those out of flower 
should have the young shoots regulated and 
thinned, so as to form handsome heads for 
next season. 

Primulas. — Pot off seedlings, or shift those 
previously potted if they require it ; keep 
them in a rather shady situation ; be very 
careful that they never get thoroughly dry. 



Violets. — Keep the ground stirred among 
those planted out into the open ground, and 
supply them copiously with water in dry 
weather ; cut off the runners to strengthen 
the main stems. 

Wardian Cases. Water if necessary, and 
change or prune any plants growing out of 
bounds. Change the position often with regard 
to light, unless the case is fixed to a particular 
spot. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

As these are emptied to fill the flower 
garden, they should be thoroughly repaired 
and made ready for the reception of the next 
crop, whether of flower or kitchen garden 
subjects. After well washing and cleaning, the 
pits should be lime-whited, using the lime as 
hot as possible, so as to ensure the greatest 
amount of destruction to insects. 

Annuals. — Shift all the tender sorts that 
require it, and maintain a steady heat about 
them, giving air rather freely in fine weather, 
and shading in the hottest part of the day. 
Use a rich free soil for these plants, and sow 
a little more of any in particular request. The 
half hardy kinds should be gradually hardened 
off by giving air in larger proportions than 
before, admitting some at night, so as to allow 
of their being planted out of doors by the 
second or third week. Shift such as are in- 
tended to be grown in pots, and water freely, 
syringing in the afternoon. 

Half-hardy Plants, as verbenas, calceo- 
larias, salvias, scarlet geraniums, and others 
used for bedding out in the flower-garden, 
should be gradually inured to the open air, so 
as to feel little or no check when finally planted 
out. The lights may be left off entirely for 
the last few nights before planting. Do not 
let the roots become dry, or the plants will 
suffer, whether before or after removal. Pot 
off rooted cuttings, and put in others of such 
plants as are likely to be useful for decoration 
later in the season. Shift such plants as it 
may be desirous to increase by cuttings or 
otherwise, and do not allow them to bloom. 
Thus treated, new or rare things are more 
under command, and supply better and firmer 
cuttings than if turned out in the open ground. 
Water regularly, and fumigate whenever the 
green fly makes its appearance. 

Forcing Pit. — Keep up a succession of 
flowers by introducing fresh supplies, but in 
smaller quantities than before, as many of the 
forcing plants will be in bloom naturally during 
the month ; but, especially, have roses enough 
to meet the natural season with plenty ; they 
are very seldom too numerous. Carry on in- 
cessant war with insects, and give air freely ; 
shut up rather early, and syringe plentifully 
early, and also in the afternoon. The heat 
may range from 60 degrees as the minimum, 



530 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAY. 



to 70 degrees as the maximum, which will he 
sufficient for all forcing purposes. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 55 to 60 degrees by 
day, and 45 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely, and leave 
some on all night when the weather will permit. 

Watering. — The supply of moisture must be 
liberally increased with the seasonal rise of 
temperature ; by this time the plants will 
probably need water daily ; the syringe may 
be used freely both morning and evening, so 
that any expanded blossoms are not wetted. 
Examine the roots especially of old or large 
specimens, and be well convinced that they are 
thoroughly soaked occasionally ; they will 
surfer less then if they are sometimes missed. 

Potting. — Continue to shift such plants as 
may require it, adapting the size of the pots to 
the habit of the plant, or the nature of the 
house or purpose for which it is wanted. Be 
very particular in the drainage of every pot, 
as on that alone more than on the soil will 
frequently depend the whole success of the 
plant. 

Soils. — Always keep the potting-shed well 
supplied with the different soils, and other 
materials necessary, as pots, stakes, tallies, 
matting, &c. A great deal of time may be 
thus saved, especially as regards tallies, which 
may be made and sorted ready for use in 
winter, or on wet days. 

Dressing. — Remove all dead leaves, flowers, 
or plants out of flower, as soon as they become 
faded ; tie up and stop the creepers where 
necessary; never allow them to interfere with 
other plants. 

Insects. — Use every means to keep down 
the various insects, whose numbers will become 
enormously increased as the weather grows 
warmer. 

Aloes, and similar plants, should be supplied 
with more water as they advance in growth, 
and should be kept warm and exposed to in- 
tense light. 

Agaves should be watered rather sparingly; 
they may be kept in the coldest part of the 
house to inure them for removal to their out- 
door stations by the middle or end of the 
month. 

Alstromerias. — Thin out the weaker shoots 
and support the others ; give a good shift if 
necessary, and keep them in a cool airy part 
of the house ; supply them freely with water. 

Annuals. — Shift such as require it, and 
stake and tie them as they advance ; water 
freely, as from the number and succulence of 
their leaves and roots they require a large 
amount of moisture when growing. 

Azaleas that have done flowering should be 
well watered, and placed in a warm house to 



perfect their growth. Any symptoms of the 
roots getting dry from the water not pene- 
trating the ball of earth, must be watched and 
attended to, or death will result. 

Calceolarias. — Shade those in flower; they 
require plenty of water ; use manure water 
occasionally. Keep them regularly tied as 
they advance, or they soon become unmanage- 
able ; stand them on an airy stage, near the 
glass. 

Camellias. — Keep them growing steadily ; 
water freely ; disbud or cut back in time, so 
as to form neat heads. They bear shade well, 
and may now and then be syringed. 

Cape Bulbs. — Some of the Gladioli will 
be in flower ; water freely, and let them have 
all the air and light possible, in order that the 
foliage may attain a proper development. 

Cephalotus j'ollicularis (New Holland 
pitcher-plant), requires a pan under the pot ; 
the glass over it may be elevated a little, but 
not for so long a time as to dry the plant too 
much. 

Cinerarias. — Propagate by parting the 
roots and potting them again; or bed them out 
in a moist shady border to be potted up in 
September. 

Chrysanthemums. — Part the old roots and 
repot them, or better, if not done before, turn 
them out in rows to grow to supply strong 
cuttings and layers later in the season; the 
first method will produce the largest and tallest, 
the second the neatest plants. 

Crassulas. — Several of these will be in 
bloom ; keep them rather cool to prolong their 
duration ; water sparingly ; when out of flower 
give them more heat and moisture, that they 
may grow freely. 

Cyclamens. — Some of the varieties may be 
kept in flower far into the summer by keeping 
the roots in a cool and shady place, and start- 
ing them at different periods. Water regu- 
larly such as are in bloom, but reduce the 
supply when the leaves show signs of matu- 
rity, and dry them gradually. 

Epacris. — Place in any airy but rather 
warm situation, and water regularly and 
copiously until they have completed their 
growth. 

Ericas. — Continue to shift as they display 
the necessity: remember that a heath once 
really dry at the root is lost ; therefore water 
thoroughly and abundantly, shading the grow- 
ing plants in bright sunshine, and allow no 
obstruction to the freest circulation of air. 
Keep the plants constantly stopped until the 
desired shape is attained, and syringe them on 
warm evenings. Propagate from the points 
of the young shoots as soon as they are long 
enough and firm enough for cuttings. 

Fuchsias. — Continue to stake and train them 
as they advance, placing those which are com-

mencing to flower in a light and airy situation, 
in order to have the flowers stout and well 
coloured. Give them manure water occa- 
sionally. 

Gompholobiums, and similar creepers, must 
be regularly tied as they advance, or they 
soon look bad. Some of them will be in flower ; 
shade them, and water carefully. 

Haworthias, Apicras, &c, should be kept 
in a warm place near the glass, and should be 
incited to strong and early growth, in order 
to have the hot season to ripen in. Water 
regularly and rather freely. 

Helichrysums will be coming into bloom ; 
keep them near the light in an airy place, and 
water regularly and thoroughly, but not too 
often. 

Leschenaultias. — Shift free growing and 
young plants, shading and keeping them close 
at first ; water with great circumspection, as 
they are very liable to damp at this stage. 

Lilium jaj)onicum (Japan lily). — Shift 
if necessary, using large pots and rough 
compost. Water abundantly, and keep them 
in an airy place, where they will not be 
drawn. 

Mignonette. — Propagate the tree variety, 
either by cuttings or seeds, and train them to 
a single stem ; when potted off" keep them in 
an airy situation ; they will be found very 
useful in autumn and winter. 

Nero Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiasas, &c. — Shift, if not already done, and 
tie up and regulate the young shoots as they 
advance. Water carefully but plentifully, for 
if the drainage is efficient no danger can well 
occur to healthy plants. 

Orange trees. — Gradually harden those 
which are to be placed out of doors during 
summer by admitting a free circulation of air 
to them, and by not watering to so great an 
extent as would be proper for those retained 
under glass. The latter should be well en- 
couraged in their growth by liquid manure, 
syringing, and shutting up the house rather 
early in the afternoon. Attend to the regu- 
lation of the head by stopping or cutting out 
misplaced shoots. 

Oxalis. — Keep these near the glass, and in 
a free circulation of air, and supply them 
liberally with water through the flowering 
season, and until the leaves are matured ; then 
gradually lessen the quantity. 

Pelargoniums. — Shade those which are 
coming into flower ; water freely, using ma- 
nure-water about once a week ; keep them 
free from insects and dirt of every sort. Those 
from which seed is wanted should be placed 
by themselves, and the flowers should be care- 
fully guarded from bees, who will cut a hole 
through the unexpanded petals to reach the 
nectar in the flower tube, thus spoiling the 



flower, and most likely at the same time im- 
pregnating the stigma. 

Primulas. — Keep the young plants shifted 
as they fill their pots ; but it is better not to 
commence so early with them. Look to the 
old roots of the double varieties ; put them in 
a cool shady place, and water carefully. 

Proteas, Banhsias, Dryandras, &c, should 
be encouraged in their growth by a good 
watering whenever they appear dry. It is 
advisable not to set them out of doors until 
they have nearly completed their growth, 
when they should be well staked, to prevent 
their being blown about. 

Rhododendrons. — Keep them thoroughly 
watered while growing, and be sure that the 
ball is thoroughly soaked ; they should have 
plenty of air, especially when their growth is 
completed, but their tender foliage should not 
be exposed to the direct rays of the sun. 

Roses. — Guard diligently against insects ; 
hand-pick for the " worm i' the bud," and 
use the usual remedies against others. Thin 
out the weaker branches, and stop and tie up 
the climbing ones where necessary. 

Salvias.- — Shift, and stop and tie up these, 
keeping them close, and shading for a few days; 
water freely, and keep them, when established, 
in a warm but airy situation. 

Siapelias. — Shift, if not already done : tie 
up the stronger, or longer growing sorts ; and 
expose them to the most intense light, when a 
little established. Water rather freely as they 
advance in growth. 

Tropceolums. — Grow these in the most airy 
part of the house, and near the glass, except 
when in flower, when they should be shaded : 
they want training almost every day. Guard 
them carefully from slugs and snails, and also 
from the green cabbage caterpillar, which will 
sometimes commit great havoc on them : keep 
them rather moist than otherwise. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature. — From 60 to 70 degs. by 
day, and about 50 degs. at night. This struc- 
ture being more for the display of flowers 
brought forward in other houses than for the 
growth of them, it is requisite to keep the 
temperature somewhat low in proportion to 
the advance of the season. Shade is now 
indispensable, and will be in almost constant 
use. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely, but on windy 
days do not open the sashes on the windward 
side of the house. Leave more or less air on 
all night. 

Watering. — Be careful in applying water 
to the roots of plants brought from warmer 
houses; those from similar or colder houses 
will require a liberal supply. The paths 
should be kept as damp as can well be managed 



232 



GARDENING CALENDAR TOR MAY. 



in such a place. If any of the permanent 
plants require syringing, the plants in flower 
should be watered as little as possible. 

Arrangement. — This depends so entirely 
on the sort of structure that but little can be 
said in the way of particular directions. Where 
the house admits, a somewhat irregular design, 
but not without some general agreement, is 
perhaps the best. Where the house and plants 
are small, a series of small stages or beds, to 
correspond with the style of the house or 
adjoining grounds would perhaps be more 
interesting ; while the constant change of 
plants and difference of arrangement would 
prevent the sameness from proving mono- 
tonous. 

General directions. — These are so generally 
applicable, that what has been said in previous 
months may be referred to. The necessity of 
neatness in every thing is obvious ; even in 
tying, use the smallest strand of bass sufficient 
to the purpose to which it is applied, turn the 
knot away from the general point of view, and 
cut the ends very close to the knot. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature. — From 75 to 80 degrees, 
occasionally higher with sun heat ; at night 60 
or 65 degrees. 

Ventilation. — Give air as soon as the tem- 
perature begins to rise higher than necessary. 
Shut up early, or as soon as the heat begins to 
decline rapidly ; avoid draughts. 

Watering. — Apply moisture regularly and 
nbundantly wherever wanted, and in whatever 
form ; syringe night and morning, and also 
damp every part of the house, as the walls, 
pathways, &c. ; always use the water about 
or above the temperature of the house. 

Potting. — Continue to pot as the various 
plants require. Have a movable potting 
bench to take into the house ; the soil should 
be put into the house overnight so as to be 
warmed. Stove plants are often seriously 
damaged by being taken into potting sheds. 

Insects. — Keep up the war against all ver- 
min ; allow nothing to interfere with the 
immediate destruction of every thing injurious 
to the plants. 

AcJiimenes. — Shift as often as necessary, 
and grow them away rapidly, keeping them 
near the light, to guard against their being 
drawn ; water freely, but see that the water 
does not lodge about the roots. 

Aliamanda, JBeaumontia, Echites, and other 
strong growing climbers should be kept tied 
up, and trained. Water freely unless early 
flowering be desirable ; stop the stronger 
shoots occasionally. The other two mentioned 
may be grafted on Beaumontia. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and their allies, 
should be kept in strong heat, abundantly sup- 



plied with water, and shifted when necessary ; 
syringe constantly. 

Aphelandra.% Justicias, Ruellias, &c. — Shift 
as they require it, to grow them freely ; syringe, 
and be constantly on guard for the red spider. 
Aviaryllids. — Keep them well supplied with 
water as long as the leaves continue to enlarge, 
and shift if necessary; or better, turn them 
out into a prepared pit near the glass, and take 
great care not to damage the foliage. 

Eegonias. — Grow steadily on, shifting such 
as require it, and removing any in flower to 
cooler quarters ; keep a steady heat about 
them, and be very careful they do not want 
for water. 

Burchellias. — Keep them growing until they 
appear set, by giving a liberal supply of water, 
and by shifting as necessary ; gradually reduce 
both the heat and moisture as they leave off 
growing. 

Cacti. — Excite all the tribe by liberal sup- 
plies of light, heat, air, and moisture ; have the 
drainage efficient, and water under such con- 
ditions will soon cause a difference for the 
better. Cut out the old and weak shoots, and 
support the new ones as they advance. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree), requires a 
large supply of heat and moisture while in a 
growing state ; syringe frequently. 

Clerodendrons. — Push them on by giving 
them plenty of space, and rich soil, shifting 
often if large plants are desirable ; cut in some 
so as to get a second crop. 

Climbers. — Keep these neatly tied up, stop- 
ping some of the lateral shoots occasionally so 
as to lengthen the period of flowering ; watch 
carefully for red spider, especially if the house 
is lofty. 

Daturas. — Grow these rapidly by large 
shifts, and rich soil ; they are easily propagated 
at any time, and can also be flowered at almost 
any season, by checking them, which is done 
by transferring them to a lower temperature 
for a period, and then again submitting them 
to heat. 

Erythrinas make fine plants when grown to 
a single stem ; grow them quickly until the 
flower spike is a good deal advanced, and then 
remove them to a lower temperature. By 
beginning early the same plant may be flowered 
three times in the year. 

Euphorbias. — Treat the succulent ones like 
the dwarf cacti, and make use of this month 
to forward their growth so that they may be 
well ripened during the summer months. The 
leafy kinds should also be grown freely, and 
some of them stopped to make them bushy. 

Ferns. — Keep up a moist atmosphere by 
clamping every part of the house, and 'shade 
the plants effectually from the sun, as few of 
the finer sorts can long bear the broad glare 
of day. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAT. 



233 



Gardenias. — Keep these plants well syringed, 
as the red spider is very destructive to the 
foliage of all the species. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Shift as fast as 
they require it, and keep them near the glass 
in a strong heat, with a good supply of mois- 
ture ; shade them from strong sunlight, and 
never allow them to flag from any cause. 

Hippeastrums, Cr interns, Pancratiums, &c. 
— Be careful of the foliage ; give plenty of 
room at the root, also plenty of moisture and 
heat. 

Hydrangeas. — Pot off any rooted cuttings, 
and shift those raised last summer for blooming 
this season ; water plentifully while they are 
growing ; and when they come into flower 
remove to a cooler house. 

Ipomceas. — Shift the free growing kinds, 
and train them as may be necessary ; syringe 
constantly to keep down the red spider. 

Txoras. — Remove such as are in flower to 
the conservatory, and bring the others steadily 
forward by shifting, and other means, as re- 
quired. 

Jasminums, Mondeletias, Brunfelsias. — 
Grow on in strong heat and a damp atmo- 
sphere ; train them as they advance into the 
neatest shapes ; any that have completed their 
growth should be gradually removed to a cooler 
place, reducing the supply of water at the same 
time. 

Lantanas. — Remove to a cooler house as 
they come into flower ; cut some in to keep 
them bushy, and to take the place of those in 
flower as they become straggling. 

Luculia gratissima should be kept growing, 
shifting as requisite, and guarding against 
insect enemies. 

Lycopodiwns only require to be left to 
themselves in a damp shady place ; they may 
be propagated to any extent by small pieces, 
and most of them also produce abundance of 
seeds or spores. 

Malvaceous plants, as hibiscus, will, many 
of them, be getting almost unmanageable, but 
most of them flower in very small pots ; keep 
them free from insects, to whose attacks they 
are very liable. 

Ifanettias, and other tender climbers, re- 
quire constant attention to regulate their 
shoots. See that they never suffer from 
drought or insects. 

Melastomas. — Shift as they advance, and 
remove them to cooler quarters as their flower 
buds approach full size. 

Melo Cacti. — Pot off seedlings in sandy soil 
as soon as they can be handled, shade them 
until they take root, and then treat them like 
the others, with occasional shade in very bright 
weather. Keep the old plants growing in a 
hot damp atmosphere. 

Musas should be kept growing ; and, espe- 



cially if turned out, should be abundantly 
supplied w r ith water, and occasionally with 
liquid manure ; be careful not to wet the 
blossoms after they appear, as they are very 
liable to rot. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher plant), keep these in 
the dampest and hottest part of the house, and 
syringe often. 

Neriums, in flower, should be removed to 
cooler quarters ; such as have flowered may be 
brought in again and forwarded in their growth 
for a second crop of blooms. 

Nymphceas, (Water lilies), should be so 
kept on the tanks or pipes as always to receive 
a genial bottom heat ; the water in their pans 
or pots should be constantly changed, and the 
plants kept clear of confervas and dirt. 

Palms. — Attend particularly to watering at 
their roots ; and syringe well to keep the leaves 
clear of dust. 

Polianthes (Tuberose). — Remove such as 
are becoming drawn to a cooler house ; reduce 
the supply of water a little, and give them an 
airy situation. 

Thunbergias. — Shift, stake, and train as 
necessary, and remove the flowering plants to 
the conservatory. 

Vincas grow freely, but require constant 
stopping to keep them bushy, and great atten- 
tion to keep them free of red spider. 

THE OKCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm-house from 80 
to 90 degrees by day, or more by sun heat ; 
about 70 degrees by night. The cool, or 
Mexican house, may range about 75 degrees, 
or a little more with sun heat ; 65 degrees at 
night. 

Ventilation may be pretty freely indulged 
in, if care be taken to avoid all strong draughts, 
and not to lower the temperature too much ; 
shut up in good time in the afternoon. 

Watering. — Keep a thoroughly damp atmo- 
sphere, by syringing and the use of evaporating 
pans ; let the house be well filled with steam 
morning and evening ; see that the soil in none 
of the blocks or baskets becomes dry. 

Insects. — "Woodlice and cockroaches are sad 
depredators, as are also two or three very 
minute snails, as well as the common snails 
and slugs ; an incessant war must be carried 
on against these and no doubt many others. 

Potting. — Some few may require shifting, 
but the majority ought to be growing fast. 
Many species, both East and West Indian, 
do well on naked blocks, even on the sawn 
surfaces ; and their tender roots under those 
circumstances are not so subject to rot from 
stagnant moisture as when sphagnum is used 
about them. 

Shading. — A screen composed of several 
folds of coarse w r oollen netting has been found 



234 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR MAY. 



to form a very good shading ; but even stout 
canvas has proved too thin for the growing 
plants at this season ; some efficient shade is 
indispensable. 

Soils. — Sphagnum has been largely used in 
some places for fastening on to the blocks and 
in the baskets with the roots, but when used 
in a decayed state, it has in many cases been 
attended with bad results ; it also affords har- 
bour for insects. The mosses and other plants 
growing with Orchids in their native places 
appear to be most of them alive in the neigh- 
bourhood of the best roots, and must form a 
very different substance to dead sphagnum, 
many of them being Hypnums. Nothing is 
better about the blocks than growing mosses 
and lycopodiurns. 

Imported plants. — Be very cautious in the 
use of water until they have made a decided 
push ; their treatment may then be gradually 
assimilated to that of the established ones. 
Carefully collect the dust and rubbish intro- 
duced with them, and sow it about in a damp 
corner, or among some of the plants ; many 
new plants have been obtained by this means. 

A'erides, Saccolabiums, andVandas. — These 
plants should be kept in the hottest and damp- 
est part of the house, so as to encourage a 
vigorous and early growth, that they may be i 
dried off in good time before the bright sun- 
light of the autumn is too far gone. 

Cymbidium. — This genus does best in pots 
in rather loamy soil ; and they may now be 
shifted, if not previously done. 

Ccelogyne. — Some of these plants make two 
growths in the course of the season ; and those 
that are now going out of bloom should be 
grown on so as to complete their next growth 
early, and then have a rest. 

Dendrobiums. — These should be grown on 
as rapidly as possible, but the supply of mois- 
ture should be shortened as soon as they show 
signs of maturity in the young shoots. - 

Oncidiums should be kept growing freely, 
and should be shifted from their blocks or pots 
if necessary, before the new roots are so far 
advanced as to suffer from removal. 



Stanhopeas must be repotted as soon as they 
commence their new growth, and should be 
grown on freely. 

Zygopetalums require to be kept in the 
coolest part of the house, where the heat does 
not exceed 80 degrees. 

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES. 

Transparent Cloth. — The cheapness of 
glass will render this material less sought for 
than formerly. It will still, however, be 
sometimes used in covering pits, and for other 
temporary purposes of shelter, such as harden- 
ing off plants before planting them openly. 
Slight wooden frames should be made, and 
these covered with holland or calico, stx*ained 
tight ; they are then to be painted over with 
a mixture of four ounces white resin, one 
ounce of sugar of lead, and three pints of pale 
linseed oil, the sugar of lead being ground up 
with a small quantity, and then applied to the 
remainder, and the resin incorporated with 
the oil by the aid of a gentle heat. The com- 
position is to be laid on with a brush ; and 
one coating annually is sufficient. This makes 
it both transparent and waterproof. 

Thrips are very troublesome little insects — 
in hothouses at any season, and even out- 
doors in summer — where plants are subjected 
to a hot arid atmosphere. A genial moisture 
is the great remedial resource ; but when they 
are numerous, it is best to paint the flues or 
pipes, if indoors, or the walls, if outdoors, with 
sulphur vivum, mixed with water : the flues 
must be done when they are cold ; the heat 
either of the fire or the sun gives rise to fumes 
which destroy the insects, The plants — par- 
ticularly the under side of the leaves — may 
also be frequently syringed with water in 
which sulphur is mixed. 

Docks and Dandelions, and other perennial 
thick-rooted weeds which sometimes occur in 
lawns, particularly when newly formed, may 
be got rid of by continually cutting off their 
leaves ; this must, however, be done each time 
as soon as they spring up. No plant can long 
survive a continuance of this treatment. 




THE AMERICAN COWSLIP. 



235 




THE AMERICAN COWSLIP. 



The American, or, as it is sometimes called, 
the Virginian Cowslip (Dodecatheon Meadid), 
is a hardy spring flowering perennial, in 
which character alone it claims attention, 
spring flowers being always welcomed. It, 
however, deserves consideration also for its 
intrinsic beauty, and is, besides, a very eligi- 
ble plant to reward the attention of the floi'ist; 
that is, it might be altered and varied by 
hybi'idizing, as other floi'ist's flowers have been. 

It is a perennial plant ; in winter, circum- 
scribed within the hybernacula or store-bud, 
formed just below the surface of the soil, and 
in early spring pushing out a tuft of broadly 
and largish lance -shaped leaves, which are 
coarsely saw edged ; from among these leaves 
arises the upright flower stem, growing from 
eight to twelve inches high, and bear- 
ing at top an umbel of gracefully pendent 
flowers, usually twelve together ; the petals 
of the flower are of a rosy lilac colour, reflexed 



or turned back over the calyx, giving the ap- 
pearance of a half-expanded parasol, which 
resemblance is considerably heightened by 
the long tapering shape of the parts of fructifi- 
cation. The pollen grains of this flower, when 
examined with the assistance of a compound 
microscope, are seen to be peculiarly beauti- 
ful ; they are distinctly organized minute 
pearls, so minute that one square inch will 
contain of them upwards of three millions; 
and as squares cannot be covered by circles, 
more than one-fifth of the space will still be 
left unoccupied. The plant flowers at the 
end of April and beginning of May. It grows 
in several parts of North America, and was 
first sent from Virginia by Banister, to Bishop 
Compton, in 1704, after which the plant was 
lost for several yeai's in England, till it was 
again obtained from America by Mr. Catesby, 
about 1744. 

The culture of this plant is of the simplest 



ISO

kind. It requires a somewhat shaded situ- 
ation, and a light cool soil ; it flourishes well 
in peat soil, or where peat earth predominates. 
The chief requirements are coolness in sum- 
mer, and shade from intense sun heat. Young 
plants may be obtained by dividing the root, 
when there are offsets to take away ; this is 
best done about August, which gives the 
young plants time to get established before 
winter. It also ripens seeds, which should be 
sown soon after they ripen, either in pots or a 
shady border ; if these young plants are much 
exposed to the sun, they are almost sure to 
perish, so impatient are they of heat. Young 
plants are often lost through their being 
planted in dry soil in a sunny part of the gar- 
den. If the seeds are sown in autumn the 
young plants may be removed to the borders 
where they are to remain by the autumn fol- 
lowing. 

Some seedlings of increased size, superior- 
form, and affording variety of colour, have 
already been obtained. Why, therefore, 
should not the American cowslip become a 
florist's flower, and afford a still further variety 
of beautiful forms ? The same principles of 
improvements which have, in so many other 
cases, proved successful, must be followed 
here. "What would constitute an improve- 
ment on the present flowers must be settled, 
and as any seedling approaches the standard 
of ideal perfection, this must be regarded as 
one sure step of the journey, and should lead 
to another, and again another, till the end is 
attained. "Wherever improvement is mani- 
fest, that plant or that individual blossom 
must supply the future seed, and so by con- 
tinually sowing the seed of those which mani- 
fest any degree of improvement over the 
previous races, a very considerable and per- 
manent change for the better — or, at least, an 
advance towards the ideal perfection — will be 
wrought. We have qualified the expression, 
" change for the better," because it might be 
the class of florists alone who would so regard 
it. The flower is in its present state beautiful 
and perfect in the estimation of the lovers of 
simple nature. 

Of the more distinct garden varieties which 
have been raised, the following may be no- 
ticed : — albiflorum, with white blossoms ; 
elegans, rosy-coloured, deeper than the origi- 
nal plant ; giganteum, lilac, with an increase 
of size ; and lilacinum, which also bears lilac 
flowers. Another species called Dodecatheon 
integrifolium, which bears light purple flowers, 
is also in our gardens, having been introduced 
from North America in 1829. 

The American cowslips belong to the same 
natural family — Primulaceae — as our common 
primroses and cowslips. 



AXACAMPTIS PYRAMIDALIS. 

This is one of the pretty little English 
Orchids which are sometimes seen cultivated 
in pots, and which deserve to have a per- 
manent place in our gardens. It is sometimes 
called Orchis pyramidalis, having formerly 
borne that name ; but most modern botanists 
see cause to station it in the genus Ana- 
camptis, which is named from the Greek 
word anakam/pto, to bend back, in allusion 
to the position of its pollen masses. 

The plant may be described as a tuberous- 
rooted perennial, producing a stem from twelve 
to eighteen inches high, with linear-lance- 
shaped leaves, from the centre of which rises 
the flower stem, bearing at the top a large 
broadly-ovate close spike of flowers, of a 
delicate rose colour, in some varieties white. 
The tubers grow in pairs, and are of a 
roundish ovate, or oblong form ; one of these 
tubers is that of the growing plant, the other 
the young one forming to succeed it. The 
tubers of some allied species of orchids, 
furnish the article salep. 

A. pyramidalis is found in meadows and 
pastures, chiefly in calcareous soils ; it is met 
with both in England and Scotland, and flowers 
in the months of June and July. 

The culture of the terrestrial native Or- 
chises has never been very successfully prac- 
tised, although numerous attempts have been 
made. Under these circumstances, it seems to 
offer peculiar inducements to the amateur 
cultivator, to whom a difficulty to be over- 
come offers merely an incitement to exertion. 
The best guide in these matters is nature. 
What can we learn from her ? In the first 
place the plant grows most commonly — not 
exclusively, for Hooker records it as growing 
also in clayey soil — in calcareous soils, that is 
soils of a chalky character. In most places 
it is not difficult to obtain such soils to plant 
them in ; and where it is least convenient, the 
requisite can be imparted by mixing pounded 
or broken chalk, and effete lime with a portion 
of pure loam. Again, they grow in meadows 
and pastures, and, therefore, do not require 
shade ; but it must also be recollected that 
the surface of the soil in such places is covered 
Avith a mantle of verdure, which, though it 
does not shade the growing plant, acts in a 
peculiar way in sheltering the roots while in 
a dormant state, and the probability is that 
much advantage is derived in the shape of 
protection from excessive heat, while they are 
dormant in the latter part of the summer. 
Whenever they are cultivated in the garden, 
it would, therefore, seem desirable to secure 
them a calcareous soil, and also to cover the 
surface of the bed with turf like a lawn. A 
portion of the lawn might be prepared and

planted in this way, and the space protected 
in early spring from the scythe ; and in no 
situation could they seem to be more appro- 
priately placed. 

It is surprising that more attention has not 
been paid to the growth of this, and other 
orchids in pots after the manner that hyacinths 
are grown ; for such a course of treatment 
they are well adapted, and, at least, all the 
more vigorous ones will grow readily. The 
present subject may be ranked among these 
latter. The plants should be taken up from 
their wild habitats when in flower, as they 
can then be better known, and transferred to 
a pot, without at all disturbing their roots. 
If they are thus removed just as they begin 
flowering, the blooms will then be available 
for ornament. After flowering, set them in a 



sheltered place out of doors, and attend well to 
watering them so that the leaves may be well 
perfected ; allow them to die away gradually, 
at the same time becoming partially dry ; and 
in winter set the pots in a dry cool frame, the 
soil being in a medium state of dampness. 
As spring comes on give them water, and in 
due time they will make their appearance, and 
flower, when the same course must be repeated. 
Or they may be accelerated by removal to a 
warmer situation if that be desirable. A good 
soil for them in pots is equal parts loam and 
peat, mixed with a portion of sand, some 
lumps of chalk and charcoal being mixed in 
at the time of potting. Re-potting may be 
done in the spring, just as their growth is per- 
ceived. The singular structure of these flowers 
should recommend them to especial notice.

by Messrs. Tyso, than whom few have been 
more successful in the growth of this flower, 
we find the following judicious remarks on

good culture, is the adaptation of the com- 
post to the natural habitats of the plants. 
Experience teaches that the Ranunculus 
delights in a rich hazelly loam. If, therefore, 
the natural soil of the garden be unfavourable, 
procure the top spit of a pasture of rather

giving when there is going to be a produce of 
three or four bunches, time for a few inches 
of further extension. The progress of the 
sap upwards being thus stopped will be found 
to influence quickly several of the buds below; 
but the 2nd upper one will soon so take the 
lead as to threaten to impoverish the rest, and 
must therefore be treated like the upper one ; 
and similar thereto should be the treatment of 
all the remaining buds down to that from 
which it may be thought fit to train a succes- 
sion shoot untopped." 

Cottage-garden Societies. — It has been 
proposed, as likely to be advantageous to the 
labouring classes, that societies for the en- 
couragment of cottage gardening should be 
formed by the higher class of inhabitants, in 
every village. These societies are to point 
out to the poor, the most profitable crops for 
allotment cultivation, and to supply the place 
of the now uncertain potato ; to give them 
necessary instructions as to their management; 
to offer prizes for the best productions ; and 
also for the best principle of cropping and cul- 
tivating their gardens. It is proposed that 
such societies should at once issue such rules 
and regulations as may be necessary ; and 
further, that by the aid of the wealthy they 
should distribute such seeds, roots, &c, as 
may be necessary for stocking the ground, and 
by the aid of practical members the necessary 
instructions and advice as to the mode of cul- 
tivation. The parsnip is very highly recom- 
mended for all purposes ; then the carrot, the 
Swedish turnip, and the beet-root. Onions 
and leeks are considered to be desirable ; and 
good varieties of cabbages, kales, and Savoys, 
should always be largely planted by the poor. 
Tigridias. — The two species of Tigridia, 
pavonia and conchiflora, make fine beds in 
the flower-garden in sheltered situations, not- 
withstanding the ephemeral nature of their 
blossoms, which individually last but one day : 
the succession in which they are produced 
counterbalances this objection. They may be 
planted, early in March, in pots of peat and 
sandy loam, and forwarded in a warm frame, 
being hardened off subsequently to planting 
them out in May ; or they may be planted at 
once into the beds towards the end of March 
or beginning of April, the soil being in good 
friable condition, filling up round about the 
roots at planting time with sandy peat. In 
the autumn, it is an advantage to cover the 
surface of the beds six inches thick with litter, 
to keep the frost from killing the stems too 
low down. In November they may be taken 
up and stored among perfectly dry soil, and 
examined once or twice during winter. 

Calceolarias — to increase rapidly/. — 
When the plants have made young shoots of 
three or four joints in length, after flowering, 



take off these, and cut them up in this man- 
ner: — Separate each shoot, in the middle of the 
lowest internode, that is the space between 
one pair of leaves and another ; repeat this at 
the other internodes, as many as they may be. 
Each shoot taken from the plant will thus be 
divided into three, four, or more pieces, ac- 
cording to the numbers of pairs of leaves it 
had when whole ; and each division will con- 
sist of a pair of opposite leaves, and portion 
of stem — from half an inch to an inch, ac- 
cording to circumstances — on each side of 
these leaves. Each of these pieces is then to 
be slit down the middle, so as to separate the 
two leaves, each having half the thickness of 
the portion of stem attached to it : the ex- 
treme top, which will be too small to split 
asunder in this way, may be slit from below 
upwards just through the joint, and planted 
in this state. These are the cuttings. A 
shoot having three pairs of leaves and the tip 
will thus form seven cuttings ; and as the tip 
may be pulled asunder afterwards, there will, 
in fact, be eight cuttings from such a shoot as 
is usually put in to form one plant. The cut- 
tings are planted thus : — convenient sized pots 
are filled with sandy soil, made from very 
turfy peat rubbed through a half-inch sieve, 
and mixed with equal parts of silver sand ; 
these pots must be well drained, and the soil 
covered with a half-inch layer of pure sand. 
One row of cuttings — not more, or they are 
liable to damp off — is planted round the mar- 
gin of the pot, the leaf being set towards the 
centre, and the split part of the stem close to 
the pot : the leaf must on no account be in- 
jured, as the life of the cutting depends on it. 
The bud at the base of the leaf is to be set, in 
planting them, just below the surface ; and 
the cutting must be made quite firm, by press- 
ing the soil against it and the pot : the leaves 
must not touch, or they will be liable to rot. 
A close warm frame is necessary for them, 
and they must of course be shaded. They 
usually root well ; and in due time, when 
roots enough are formed, must be separated, 
and potted singly : the plant is formed from 
the bud at the base of the leaf. The tips, 
which were to be cut, but not separated before 
planting, are to be separated after they are 
rooted, at the time of planting. This mode is 
adopted for the extensive increase of particu- 
lar kinds ; where such increase is not desired, 
of course ordinary cuttings are preferable and 
less troublesome. 

Manettia bicolor. — Where there is the 
advantage of stove-heat, the elegant orange 
and scarlet blossoms of this graceful climbing 
plant may be had in profusion for two or three 
months during the dull period of winter. To 
attain this, cuttings should be procured as 
soon as possible in the spring, and struck in a

moist heat : as soon as the}' are well rooted, 
they should be potted into foui'-inch pots, in 
some light rich sandy soil, and potted succes- 
sively as they require it. They must be kept 
growing in a moist house or frame, as near 
the glass as possible, to cause them to grow 
short-jointed and vigorous ; and at the last 
potting, about the end of July, they must 
have pots large enough to suit the trellis they 
are to be trained on, which may be of any 
shape, but none is better than a cylinder of 
two and a half or three feet high, and a foot 
in diameter, turned outwards at top. Always 
use the soil in a sweet healthy state, and as 
rough as circumstances will admit of : let it 
consist of rich loam and peat, a little cow-dung 
in a well decomposed state, with a liberal ad- 
mixture of sand ; have plenty of charcoal 
mixed with the drainage. If these simple 
rules are adhered to, the result will amply 
repay the trouble. 

The Double Yellow Rose. — The fol- 
lowing passages from old books, relating to 
this flower, which it puzzles everybody to grow 
well, are interesting : — " "Whereas all other 
roses are best natural, this is best inoculated 
upon another stock. Others thrive and bear 
best in the sun ; this, in the shade : therefore, 
the best way that I know to cause this rose to 
bring forth fair and kindly flowers, is per- 
formed after this manner. First, in the stock 
of a Francfort rose, near the ground, put in 
the bud of the single yellow rose, which will 
quickly shoot to a good length ; then, half a 
yard higher than the place where the same 
was budded, put into it a bud of the double 
yellow rose, which growing, the suckers must 
be kept from the root, and all the buds rubbed 
off, except those of the kind desired, which, 
being grown big enough to bear (which will 
be in two years), it must in winter be pruned 
very near, cutting off all the small shoots, 
and only leaving the biggest, cutting off the 
tops of them also, as far as they are small. 
Then in the spring, when the buds for leaves 
come forth, rub off the smallest of them, leav- 
ing only some few of the biggest, which, by 
reason of the strength of the stock, affordeth 
more nourishment than any other, and the 
agreeable nature of the single yellow rose, 
from whence it is immediately nourished, the 
shoots will be strong and able to bear out the 
flowers, if they be not too many, which may 
be prevented by nipping off the smallest buds 
for flowers. The tree should stand something 
shadowed, and not too much in the heat of 
the sun, and in a standard by itself, rather 
than under a wall." That which follows is 
from a book called Systema HortieuUwts, 
dated 1688 : — " There is no flower-bearing 
tree that yields blossom so beautiful as the 
rose, whereof the yellow Provence rose is the 



most beautiful where it brings forth fair and 
kindly flowers, which hath been obtained by 
budding a single yellow rose on the stock of 
a flourishing Francfort rose near the ground : 
when that single yellow is well grown in that 
branch, inoculate your double yellow rose ; 
then cut off all suckers and shoots from the 
first and second, leaving only your last, which 
must be pruned very near, leaving but few 
buds, which will have the more nourishment, 
and yield the fairer and more entire blossoms. 
This tree, or a layer from a rose of the same 
kind, delights most, and blows fairest, in a 
cold, moist, and shady place, and not against 
a hot wall." 

Gooseberry Caterpillars. — These trou- 
blesome larvae may be destroyed by the use of 
the white hellebore (Veratruvi album). It 
may be applied either in powder or in decoc- 
tion. A pound weight of the roots of the 
hellebore infused in a gallon of water, a good 
handful of elder-tops being added, will form a 
suitable liquid for application in that form : 
it is to be applied with a syringe sharply to 
the trees, so as to wet every part, the under 
side of the leaves as well as the upper ; in 
fact, the insects are usually found most nume- 
rous on the under side of the leaves and 
branches. The infusion is to be made with 
hot water, and applied when cold. "Where 
the powder is used, it is applied to the parts 
of the trees with a puff or fine dredge : it 
should be very finely ground, and quite dry, 
and in that case the puff disperses it most 
economically. 

Begonia ixcarnata. — This desirable spe- 
cies will, under proper treatment, furnish a 
supply of flowers from the middle of Novem- 
ber till April, in a temperature of from 50 to 
55 degrees. Take cuttings of the strongest 
shoots about the beginning of April, and plant 
them in peat and sand, and plunge them in a 
frame where there is a moist bottom heat of 
80 degs. In about three weeks they will be 
rooted, and are then to be potted into small 
pots in peat, silver sand, and charcoal, and 
returned to the frame, where they are to be 
grown during summer, keeping them shifted 
as they require, so that by the end of August 
they may be in eight-inch pots : at the two 
last shiftings add a little chopped turf and 
leaf mould, and also then afterward use a 
little weak manure water. "Whilst kept in 
the frame in a moist heat, they must have 
plenty of air. Top any of the shoots that 
grow straggling and spoil the symmetry of 
the plant. When their growth is completed, 
remove them to a cooler place to harden. In 
October introduce them to the stove, and in 
about a month they will show flower. They 
are best raised annually from cuttings, which 
maybe selected from the vigorous young shoots.

and hoe amongst advancing crops. "Water all 
transplanted crops ; choose dull and showery 
weather for transplanting. Use quick lime 
and salt to prevent and kill slugs, &c, and 
entrap them with seeds, cabbage leaves, flat 
pieces of board, &c. 

Asparagus. — Many prefer this month for 
planting it from the seed bed ; water the bed 
before raising the plants : clean the old estab- 
lished beds, and water them with salted rain 
water, in the proportion of two ounces of salt 
to a gallon. 

Basil may still be planted out in a warm 
spot ; that in pots, when coming into flower, 
should be cut and hung up, or laid out in a 
dry place for preserving.

being put in, with water, if dry : a late crop 
may be obtained by cutting down the March 
sowing to a few inches, when they will shoot, 
and be very prolific ; top those coming into 
bloom. 

Beet. — Thin out the plants as soon as the 
crops are fairly advanced ; nothing is gained 
by deferring the operation too long. 

Borecole. — Put in the main planting ; after 
early potatoes will do, and at twenty inches 
apart. 

Brocoli. — Plant out a main crop about the 
end of the month, two feet apart, and in quin- 
cunx order. Prick out abundantly; make 
another sowing for the spring supply. 

Brussels Sprouts. — Plant out a full crop ; 
they may be put at eighteen or twenty inches 
apart, as they do not spread much at top. 

Cabbages. — Sow about the middle of the 
month, for coleworts : plant out a few more. 

Capsicums may still be planted out against 
a south or west wall ; they should be nailed 
up or slightly protected. 

Carrots. — Thin out to the proper distances, 
if not already done. 

Cardoons. — Plant out carefully, and give 
them a thorough watering ; a trench a foot 
wide and ten inches deep, well manured,, will 
suit them. 

Caidiflowers. — Sow immediately for the 
autumn cutting, if not done ; prick out those 
to be transplanted next month. Where they 
are coming too fast for use, break down some 
of the centre leaves, so as to cover the head 
or flower ; or they may be cut and put in a 
cool place. "Water the seed ?"d pricked out

very dry. 

Celery. — Continue to prick out in a rich, 
warm, and shaded place, and water with weak 
liquid manure. Prepare and plant additional 
trenches, lifting and planting with a trowel. 
Broad trenches in which five or more rows 
can be planted are often formed where large 
quantities are required ; but it is never so 
good as when in single or double rows.

situation ; or if exposed, give water^ and shade 
with a mat. 

Endive. — Sow for the permanent crop the

ripe, take up the roots, and have them care- 
fully dried in the sun before tying them in 
bunches for storing. 

Serbs of all kinds, as sage, savory, &c, 
must be thinned according to their respective 
heights and manner of growth ; most of them 
will also transplant if carefully managed and 
well watered. The best season for gathering 
them to dry, is just as they are coming into 
bloom. 

Kidney Beans. — Make successional plant- 
ings every three weeks, until August. Put 
stakes to the scarlet runners and other tall 
growers ; keep hoeing and cleaning them. 

Leeks can still be put in ; they require a 
very rich soil, and to be merely laid in the 
hole made by the dibble, when planted. 

Lettuce. — Sow for succession. Also thin 
out and plant a few more in any spare place ; 
hoe and water them well. 

Onions. — A few may be sown if required 
for salads. Stake those retained for seed ; look 
to those that were winter sown, and take up 
when ripe, that is, when the haulm breaks 
down, and turns yellow. 

Parsnips. — Thin out, if not already done, to 
the proper distances ; do not defer the opera- 
tion too long. 

Parsley. — The present month is a good 
time to sow ; it is always much in demand. 
Thin and transplant the early sowing. 

Peas. — Make two sowings, choosing for the 
last to put in an early sort, and upon a warm 
spot ; support those coming on according to 
their manner of growth, either by stakes or 
string ; top them when at a foot high, and 
again when at three feet. Give thorough 
waterings ; a weak solution of nitrate of soda 
benefits amazingly. 

Potatoes. — Frequently hoe, and keep a 
healthy surface amongst the early crops ; do 
not earth up too heavily. 

Radishes. — Sow amongst any of the small 



seeds, to be drawn early ; yet to have them in 
a bed by themselves is preferable ; they should 
be in a moist situation. 

Savoys. — Plant out from the seed-beds, at 
about twenty inches apart, on a good soil, and 
water them. 

Seahale. — Thin out the crowns where they 
have grown too thick, and do it early, so that 
the buds which are left may have time to 
become strong and vigorous before the leaves 
decay. 

Shallots. — Take up the early planted crops, 
if the tops are turning yellow ; dry them well 
in the sun, and then tie them in small bunches 
for storing. 

Spinach. — Sow again this month, in broad 
bottomed drills. If this crop is partially shaded 
by others, it is no disadvantage now ; thin out 
advancing crops. 

Turnips. — Make another sowing ; thin out 
those which are large enough, and do it early ; 
give them a fine and rich soil. The Swedish 
turnip may yet be planted with success. 

Vegetable Marroivs. — It is still in good 
time either to plant out or sow; let it be 
under a hand-light on rich light soil, such as 
an old hotbed ; they are then sure to succeed. 

THE FRUIT GAKDEX. 

General Directions. — The training of the 
trees — particularly young ones — is now an im- 
portant operation ; as also is the thinning of 
the shoots and fruit ; protect the early fruits 
from birds ; destroy insects, and prevent their 
ravages by fumigating, syringing, dusting the 
trees with brown snuff and sulphur, &c, all 
of which will be severally necessary ; also 
examine the crevices of the walls for snails, 
grubs, &c. Do not overcrop the wall-tree 
borders. 

Apples. — The young wood as well as fruit 
of standards, and trellis, and wall trees, should 
be thinned ; this may now be successfully per- 
formed. Both old and young trees which have 
been transplanted, should be mulched and well 
watered. Tie up, or nail the young shoots of 
grafts and trees, taking care not to fasten 
either too tight : remove all suckers and 
shoots below the grafts. 

Apricots. — The fruit and shoots may now 
be thinned, with freedom, but it must be done 
still by degrees ; pin in the young wood, and 
nail in the shoots at the extremities. Two 
fruits to a square foot is a fair crop ; and to 
leave the well-placed backmost buds or shoots 
will often be found more than a sufficient 
supply of young wood. 

Cherries. — Give a final dressing, and pre- 
pare to protect the fruit by netting. Forked 
sticks, eighteen inches long, will be necessary 
against the walls to keep the netting from 
pressing against the trees. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JUNE. 



243 



Currants, when wanted large, should now 
be thinned, and a little liquid manure given. 

Figs. — Continue to thin and to pinch off 
the points of the young shoots when from six 
to nine inches long, and so induce the tree to 
form spurs, and make moderate growth. 

Filberts. — Rub off and remove all suckers 
at their first appearance. 

Gooseberries. — Those required for tarts 
may be taken by way of thinning ; those re- 
quired fine must be now assisted by thinning, 
and a little liquid manure is also beneficial. 

Nectarines. — If the trees are in excellent 
health, thin the fruit to about two or three to 
the square foot, and thin the young shoots to 
about five or six inches apart ; pin and nail 
in as required. 

Peaches.- — -Treat as the nectarine exactly ; 
remove all the rampant and crude shoots, or, 
if the wood is thin, top them to produce other 
shoots to fill up. 

Pears. — Go over the grafts, and support 
any that need it ; remove all suckers. For 
those kinds which bear best on the young 
wood, provision must now be made by laying 
in a proper supply. 

Plums. — Thin the young shoots, and also 
the fruit where too thick upon the trees ; thin 
especially where it is in bunches. 

Raspberries. — See that they are securely 
staked and tied ; and thin out the suckers to 
four or five. 

Strawberries. — The runners of the good 
sorts must now be secured, potting them just 
where they are, without yet cutting the 
runner ; mulch and water the plants : netting 
to protect the ripe fruit from the birds must 
be seen to soon. 

Vines. — Shorten every shoot to the first or 
second joint above the bunch, and only allow 
one bunch to a shoot ; as soon as they are set, 
give them a moderate thinning. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Where the fruit is 
colouring and nearly ripe, give air plentifully, 
and withhold water. The water must be 
gradually withheld from those later fruits 
which are about to colour. The very late 
crops must yet have abundant moisture, and 
air admitted with caution. The keeping down 
of insects, and if possible preventing them, is 
a " standing order." 

Apricots. — Temperature, from 70 to 80 
degrees by day, and 55 degrees at night. 
Give no water, and have air on night and day. 
Nets or mats may be hung below the trees to 
prevent the falling fruits from being bruised. 

Cherries. — Temperature, from 65 to 70 
degrees by day, and 55 degrees at night. As 
soon as the house is cleared, give the trees a 
thorough syringing, and the sashes may be 



taken off. Those in pots may be set out in a 
good situation, and the pots slightly plunged 
or covered. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature, from 70 to 90 
degs. by day, and 65 degs. at night. The 
exhausted plants may be cut back, and the 
soil renewed, and another good crop may be 
then expected ; or for late crops plant out 
those raised from seeds, cuttings, or layers : 
shut up early ; fumigate to destroy aphides. 

Figs. — Temperature, 70 degs. by day, and 
60 degs. by night. Gather the fruit in the 
morning, handling it very gently, and lay it 
in a cool place. Liquid manure may be given 
to those growing ; also syringe them, and 
attend to stopping the young shoots. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature, from 70 to 
80 degs. by day, and 65 degs. by night. 
Maintain a moist atmosphere, without which 
it is impossible to keep them clean ; stake up 
those inclined to run, and allow no old pods to 
remain . 

Melons. — Temperature, from 70 degs. to 
90 degs. by day, and 70 degs. at night. 
They will be found to grow in much less heat, 
but not so advantageously : thin and impreg- 
nate the late crops ; maintain a moist heat, 
especially to those in a growing state. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature, 60 degs. If 
the beds are covered with hay, it is welt to 
have it renewed occasionally ; the non-appli- 
cation of fire heat renders watering almost 
unnecessary, yet the giving of air makes a 
little sometimes requisite. 

Musas. — Tempei'ature, from 80 to 90 degs. 
by day, and from 70 to 80 degs. at night. 
Continue to maintain a moist heat ; the suckers 
should be allowed to remain after the fruit and 
old stock are cut : each forms a distinct plant, 
when separated ; proceed as before. 

Nectarines. — Temperature, from 70 to 80 
degs. by day, and from 50 to 60 degs. at 
night. Give no water, and admit air night 
and day. Where the fruit is gathered, give a 
good syringing : some shut up their houses 
when cleared, to ripen the wood, but at this 
season it is quite unnecessary. The late crops 
will require unceasing attention to thinning, 
disbudding, and tying in ; thin out the fruit 
to two and three for every square foot. 

Peaches. — Temperature, from 70 to 80 
degs. by day, and 55 degs. at night. Provide 
against the falling of the fruit when ripe by 
putting up nets or mats, or strewing the bot- 
tom of the border with moss or any soft 
material : use no water after the fruit changes 
colour. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature, from 75 to 80 
degs. by day, and about 70 degs. at night. 
Have the bottom heat from 80 to 90 degs. 
If the plants are far from the glass, no shad- 
ing is requisite, but if near, which is better, 
R 2

give a slight shading in very bright weather ; 
a little air may be left on at night. 

Vinery. — Temperature, from 75 to 85 clegs, 
by day. and from 65 to 70 degs. by night. 
Very little fire heat is necessary now, unless 
the fruit is wanted early ; gradually lessen the 
watering to those colouring, and air a little at 
night, if mild : sponge over the leaves if red 
spider appears. The late houses must receive 
no check ; and those which are cleared must 
be thoroughly ventilated. 

FLOWER GARDEN" AXD SHRUBBERY. 

Son; for succession a few of the most showy 
annuals ; biennials, and perennials to plant 
out in spring, may yet be sown. 

Plant and Transplant all annuals, half 
hardy, and greenhouse plants, that are worthy 
of attention. 

General Directions. — Mow, sweep, and roll 
lawns ; dress and clean borders and walks ; 
stake and peg plants as required ; and if dry 
weather prevails, give all transplanted things, 
especially dahlias, good soakings of water. 
Keep in reserve a few annuals and other plants 
to fill up the vacancies which are certain to 
occur. The taking up of bulbs, and the 
shortening of the luxuriant shoots of shrubs, 
&c, and cutting all dead flower stalks, must 
also be attended to. 

Auriculas. — Those which are being kept 
for seed wail be the better for sun, but all 
others must be put in a shady situation, and 
the pots plunged in sand, coal ashes, or saw- 
dust : if a frame can be spared, it is an advan- 
tage to have them protected from heavy rains. 

Annual*. — Lose no time in thinning out, and 
place about them sturdy twigs to support them : 
reserve a few in pots to succeed the early bulbs. 

Anemones. — Those planted in February 
should now be copiously watered, and shaded 
from the mid-day sun : those past bloom must 
be taken up so soon as the foliage turns 
yellow ; dry them in the shade ; afterwards 
clean and store them away in boxes. 

Calceolaria* may all be safely planted out : 
the shrubby sorts look well either in masses or 
as single specimens ; the seedling and old 
plants of the herbaceous kinds are best in 
beds ; and all are the better of a little peat : 
if they are at all infested with insects, it will 
be well to fumigate them before being put out. 

Campanulas, such as C. pyramidalis. must 
be timely staked, and will be improved by a 
watering of weak clear liquid manure. Such 
kinds as C. garganica. should be prepared for 
the edges of baskets, &c. 

Carnations. — Place those in pots on stands 
in water ; or be very careful of earwigs : look 
for the wireworm at the root of the plant : 
thin the flower stems to the strongest, and 
gently syringe them if there are no jefreshing 



showers ; begin propagating by the end of the 
month : treat the flowers as explained under 
Pinks and Picotees. 

Chrysanthemums. — Top those required to 
he dwarf, and give liberal waterings with 
liquid manure. 

Colchicums may now be increased by lifting 
and dividing the bulbs ; they are nothing the 
better for being moved, and should be planted 
again immediately. 

Crocus. — When the leaves appear to wither, 
it is time to take them up ; attend to drying 
them before cleaning and storing them. The 
autumnal kinds may now be increased by lift- 
ing, but none are any the better for being 
often moved ; plant them again at once. 

Dahlias may now be with safety planted 
out : some prefer putting in the stake before 
making the pit for the plant ; this is immate- 
rial, but attend to tying them at once, and 
not too tight : destroy the earwigs and vermin 
as fast as possible ; for this end, use reeds, or 
bean stalks, and put on the stakes inverted 
flowerpots, with a littlemoss at the bottom, &c, 
which look over daily ; liquid manure will 
benefit the plants when they are growing freely. 

Fuchsias may have liquid manure once a 
week : stake and tie them out to suit their 
various positions. Those trained to one stem 
should have the side shoots topped, to thicken 
the side branches and assist the leader. 

Lobelias. — When the strong growing sorts, 
as L. fulgens and ignea, have commenced 
growing freely, water liberally with liquid 
manure, and keep them damp. The L. gra- 
cilis is one of the best for vases, baskets, &c, 
inasmuch as few of the others grow so rapidly. 

Pansies. — Continue to propagate these ; 
when a bed of them has nearly passed its best, 
the plants should be cut close over, and have a 
top-dressing of fresh soil, when they will 
flower again beautifully in autumn ; shade 
those in good condition ; and water all over 
freely in the evening. 

Petunias look well on banks closely pegged 
down ; they also do in masses, staked up in the 
centre, and pegged around the edge ; have 
respect to the proper mixing of the colours. 

Pinks. — Reduce the stems to one, and the 
buds to three ; as they swell, tie a piece of 
matting or worsted round the middle of the 
bud, and place a round piece of card with a 
hole in the centre, to form as it were a resting- 
place for the under petals, on which all the 
others must be neatly folded ; water occasion- 
ally, if very dry : commence propagating by 
pipings at the end of the month. 

Picotees. — Treat the same as carnation, and 
if likely to be too early for show, take off the 
most forward buds, and allow the best lateral 
bloom buds to take their place : seeds may yet 
be sown. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JUNE. 



245 



Ranunculus. — The early beds may be taken 
up when getting yellow, and those now coming 
into bloom should be shaded and liberally 
watered. 

Roses, — Prepare for budding at the end of 
the month ; propagate the fine sorts ; they 
will strike most readily by slips, put in a 
gentle heat : syringe with tobacco water when 
green fly appears ; a dusting with snuff is 
also effectual. 

Stocks. — Now is a good time to plant out 
masses of the German sorts : sow also of the 
Brompton, &c, to be planted out in autumn. 

Tulips. — Expose as they go out of bloom ; 
and when fully ripe, that is, when the leaves 
are brown, and the stems decay, then take 
them up : continue to shade those not yet 
past ; remove the seed pods as soon as the 
flowers fade, unless seed is wanted. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

Clear away all bulbs or other plants that 
are past their prime, and advance the most 
forward of the succession plants to their places. 
The foliage of all should be kept perfectly free 
from dust. 

Begonias, as they advance towards flower- 
ing, should be shaded from the hottest sun, 
and regularly supplied with water. 

Camellias. — Keep these perfectly clean, and 
out of the mid-day sun, until they have com- 
pleted their growth ; keep them cool at the 
root by regular waterings. 

Cinerarias. — These must be watered regu- 
larly, and kept free from weeds to encourage 
their growth. 

Fuchsias will now be advancing to perfec- 
tion, and require to be neatly staked, and 
very regularly supplied with water, or they 
quickly lose their flowers ; shade those in 
bloom from the most powerful rays of the sun. 

Geraniums. — Continue shade to those in 
flower, and w r ater copiously as the heat in- 
creases ; this is now best done at night, so 
that the plant may recruit its energies before 
the heat of the day. 

Myrtles and similar evergreens should be 
copiously watered, and freely exposed to light 
and air, to prevent them from growing weakly. 

Primulas. — Shift into larger pots if requi- 
site, and keep them from the bright sunshine, 
giving them plenty of air and moisture, night 
and morning. 

Roses. — Shade those in flower, and keep 
them free from fading leaves or flowers: remove 
those out of flower to a sheltered situation, 
and do not let them suffer for want of water. 

Violets. — Keep those planted out for autumn 
potting, free from weeds, and well watered in 
dry weather ; still propagate by runners or 
cuttings if necessary. 

Wardian Cases should be placed as near 



the light as possible, and watered thoroughly 
if necessary ; replace any deaths among the 
plants, and keep all dead or decaying leaves 
picked off. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

Annuals. — As the tender annuals advance 
into flower, remove them to the greenhouse 
or conservatory, and shift such others as 
require it, giving them plenty of room and 
air as they expand ; sow again early in the 
month, so as to maintain a supply through the 
season ; and pot off those sown last month, 
keeping them close and shaded for a few days 
until they root again, and then admit air and 
light gradually. 

Half-hardy plants, as verbenas, &c, will 
be chiefly removed by this time, except new 
ones, which it maybe advisable to grow freely 
for specimens, or to supply cuttings : keep 
such plants shifted as they advance ingrowth; 
pick off all the bloom from the latter, and take 
off the cuttings as soon as they are of sufficient 
size ; insert the cuttings thinly in very sandy 
soil under bell glasses, and plunge them in a 
gentle bottom heat ; keep them shaded and 
moi?t, and in a fortnight they will be fit to 
pot off, and also to top for a fresh supply of 
cuttings. — Attend regularly to the watering of 
all plants in the frames, and guard carefully 
against the increase of green fly or other 
vermin. 

Forcing Pit. — All plants which have been 
brought forward here, require regular atten- 
tion during the heat of summer, that they 
do not suffer for want of water ; plunge those 
lately done with, such as roses, in a partially 
shaded place in the open ground, and mulch 
them with litter of any sort if the weather sets 
in very dry ; remove suckers, and cut any 
strong growing shoots, so as to enable the 
plants to form a regular head for the next 
season. Give air freely to any plants still in- 
doors, and guard against the increase of green 
fly, or other insect enemies. They generally 
multiply very rapidly in the still atmosphere 
of a pit or forcing-house. Leave air all night 
if the evenings are hot. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 60 to 65 degrees by 
day, and 50 degrees during the night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely day and night, 
but avoid heavy rains reaching the plants 
through the openings of the top lights, or too 
strong currents of air by the side lights. 

Watering. — Administer water plentifully, 
both to the root and top of the plants; syringing 
freely all plants in a growing state. Never 
allow a hard-wooded plant (such as a heath, 
epacris, &c.) to droop in the leaf; if this 
occurs it is generally fatal. Syringe lightly 
at night, but copiously in the morning, so that 



246 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JUNE. 



the plants are somewhat dry by the time the 
sun becomes powerful. 

Potting. — Continue to shift such plants as 
require it, but do not over-pot hard-wooded 
plants. They are easily injured by such a 
practice, even when great care is taken in the 
drainage. Pot or prick off all seedlings or 
cuttings as soon as they are ready, and shade 
and water regularly until they are established 
in their new positions. 

Soils. — Always be on the look out to collect 
different substances, so as to have them within 
reach at all times. Few soils deteriorate by 
laying in heaps ; even manures intended for 
composts for greenhouse plants can hardly be 
too much decomposed ; hence the advantage 
of having a good stock. 

Dressing. — Keep every part of the house, 
and every plant quite clean ; never allow one 
plant to usurp a portion of the room necessary 
for its neighbour ; stake and tie up all as they 
advance in growth. 

Insects. — Fumigate with tobacco, or syringe 
with diluted tobacco water as often as the 
green fly appears ; a day or two of neglect is 
not to be recovered. 

Agaves may be placed out of doors in their 
summer stations, and should be freely watered 
as soon as they show signs of renewed growth. 

Aloes, and similar plants, may be watered 
according to the vigour of their growth, in 
which they should be encouraged to the utmost. 

Alstromerias should be shaded if in bloom, 
and kept cool at the root : as they begin to 
decline after flowering, the quantity of water 
should be gradually reduced. 

Annuals, such as are still in a luxuriant 
condition, may be finally shifted, and may also 
be tied out, to give them the requisite shape ; 
water the more luxuriant growing sorts now 
and then, with manure water. 

Azaleas. — Grow these on freely, shifting 
all such as require it ; let them be shaded 
from the mid-day sun, and freely watered and 
syringed until their growth is complete, when 
they may be more exposed. 

Calceolarias — Keep those for late bloom- 
ing in a shad} r , cool, and airy house, carefully 
guarding against either an excess or deficiency 
of water ; shade those in bloom, and remove 
such as are past, to a cool frame. 

Camellias should be encouraged to perfect 
their growth by a regular supply of heat and 
moisture, with a sufficient admission of air to 
prevent their being weakened, or drawn, as it 
is technically called. 

Cape Bulbs. — These plants require the 
greatest amount of light which can possibly 
be given ; they should therefore be near the 
glass, and should also enjoy a free circulation 
of air, and considerable moisture, while in a 
growing state : as soon as the foliage of 



any of the species begins to wither, withhold 
water. 

Cephaloh'S follicularis (New Holland Pit- 
cher-plant) must be kept moist both at root 
and top, but a free circulation of air is also 
necessary to guard against excessive damp. 

Cinerarias. — Continue to propagate and 
pot off seedlings ; grow them in cool frames, 
and shade them from the sun, but expose them 
freely at night. 

Chrysanthemums should be grown in a free 
airy place, and not urged too much yet : those 
turned out should be kept free from weeds, 
and watered occasionally in very dry weather : 
shift a few of the earliest sorts so as to encou- 
rage them to bloom early. 

Crassidas. — Those past blooming should be 
grown on freely, in order to gain time to ripen 
them thoroughly before autumn : an occa- 
sional watering with manure water may be had 
recourse to, when they are in full growth. 

Cyclamens. — Shift those growing freely; 
or, what is better, plant them out, especially 
seedlings, in a free soil and shady situation, 
where they will grow rapidly. 

Epacris. — Water freely until they complete 
their growth, when the supply must be short- 
ened, but by no means withheld : tie them 
out regularly, and stop over-luxuriant shoots. 

Ericas. — These may still be shifted where 
necessary. Protect the pots of such as are set 
out of doors from the direct rays of the sun, 
and also from dry currents of air, either of 
which conditions is very fatal to these fine- 
rooted plants ; a good plan is to plunge them 
in coal-ashes, or moss, keeping this material in 
a rather damp state, and allowing the heads 
of the plants to be freely exposed, except to 
the mid- day sun. Attend very particularly 
to the state of the roots, and keep the tops 
well stopped back, to form neat compact heads. 

Fuchsias. — Shift the plants as they require 
it, shading them for a time afterwards : water 
abundantly, and keep them neatly trained. 

Gompholobiums, and similar creeping plants, 
should be encouraged in their growth, and 
brought into the requisite shape as they ad- 
vance ; keep the roots cool, and water carefully. 

Hatvortliias, Apicras, &c, should be en- 
couraged in growth, but not so as to commence 
a second start : as they appear to arrive at 
maturity, the supply of water should be 
reduced, but the plants should still be sub- 
mitted to intense light and heat. 

Helichrysums require careful watering, and 
their roots and pots should not be exposed to 
the direct action of the sun ; regulate such as 
are growing freely, by stopping the most lux- 
uriant shoots. 

Leschenaultias. — Shift such as require if, 
making sure of a porous soil, so that water 
may be freely administered, and may as freely 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JUNE. 



247 



pass away ; tie out the brandies so as to form 
a nice round head. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan lily). — Support 
the advancing stems, and give a final shift ; 
supply water freely, and keep the leaves free 
from dirt by frequent syringing. 

Mignonette. — Those plants which are in- 
tended to assume a tree-like habit, must be 
kept free from side shoots, and all the flower 
heads must be pinched out : plants raised from 
cuttings are most manageable in this respect, 
as they do not produce so many laterals. 

New Holland Plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiaeas, &c, if placed out of doors, should 
be secured from being blown about, and 
screened from the mid-day sun : water regu- 
larly, as long as they continue to grow. 

Orange Trees. — Towards the middle of the 
month these may be placed out. of doors : the 
situation should always be as sheltered as 
possible from harsh winds, but fully exposed 
to the sun ; syringe them well on hot even- 
ings, and give them an occasional watering 
with manure water. Those in-doors should 
be encouraged by similar appliances, and a 
free circulation of air : stop or cut back all 
strong or misplaced branches. 

Oxalis. — Where the leaves of any are 
decaying, water should be gradually withheld, 
until they are quite dried off, and the pots 
may then be put away on a shelf where they 
will get plenty of sun, but no water. 

Pelargoniums. — Cut down those that are 
out of bloom, and keep the roots rather dry 
for some time : continue to shift such as are 
approaching to bloom, and also such as are 
intended for still later use. Propagate all 
sorts, those for forcing first, by cuttings, 
under hand-glasses, in pits, or in the open 
border. Stop those previously struck, so as 
to make them branch to form a head : if these 
are sufficiently advanced to flower this season, 
keep them cool, until they show bloom, when 
they may be gradually brought forward. 

Primulas. — Keep these cool ; shift them 
when necessary, and pay great attention to 
the supply of water. Propagate the double, 
or any other approved varieties, by parting the 
plant, or by cuttings ; treated thus, they are 
very liable to damp if great care is not taken. 

Proteas, Banksias, Dryandras, &c, if 
placed out of doors this month, should be 
carefully attended to with water ; they must 
never be absolutely dry, nor yet do they 
require that superabundance of water which 
is necessary for some plants. 

Rhododendrons, — Place these out under a 
north or east shelter, and protect the roots 
and pots from sudden dryness : if they have 
finished growing, they should be very care- 
fully watered, for fear of starting them again 
into growth. 



Poses. — Keep up a good supply of the 
tender China and tea-scented varieties ; they 
are nearly always in flower : potted now from 
the open ground, or treated with a good shift, 
they will be found useful in the autumn. 

Salvias. — Continue to stop the leading 
shoots, and form the head of the plant as 
required : shift where necessary, using a light 
rich compost. 

Stapelias. — Encourage the growth of these 
by free watering, intense light, and great 
heat: shift any that require it, but these 
plants are generally kept in small pots — for 
what reason it would be difficult to say. 

Tropceolums. — Shade those in flower, and 
keep the others in the most airy part of the 
house : such as are past their prime should 
be gradually stinted of water, and eventually 
left entirely dry to "roast" in the sun for a 
month or two. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature. — From 70 to 75 degs. during 
the day, and about .55 degs. at night. 

Ventilation must be allowed to the fullest 
extent in hot weather, but avoid excessive 
winds, or falls of rain or hail coming in con- 
tact with the plants. 

Watering. — Water should be applied freely, 
both at the root and over head, especially on 
warm evenings : keep up as damp an atmo- 
sphere as possible, for this is almost the only 
check on insects in this structure. 

Arrangement. — Alter this as far as possible 
at every opportunity, so that sameness may 
never appear in the grouping either of plants, 
or colours. The transposition of a very few 
large showy plants will work a great change 
in the appearance of a house, and this may 
generally be done in many different ways, so 
as to materially alter the character of the 
grouping. 

General Directions. — Scrupulous neatness 
is so essentially a feature in the management 
of this structure, that a dead or fallen leaf is. 
not to be tolerated for an instant : all dust, 
cobwebs, or other accumulations should be 
removed as soon as formed ; all water slopped 
about should be wiped up, and every means 
taken to keep the place in equal order with the 
rooms of the mansion to which it is attached. 

Climbing Plants, attached to the pillars or 
rafters, should be regularly pruned and tied 
in, and so disposed as to display their flowers 
to the best advantage : the roots should be 
thoroughly examined, to see that they do not 
suffer for want of water. 

Sweet-scented Plants are of the first im- 
portance here, and a constant succession should, 
be provided, such as heliotrope, aloysia, mig- 
nonette, and many others : now is the time to 
secure a supply of these for autumn, by keep-

ing those of a shrubby habit shifted, and 
stopped, to prevent their blooming, and by 
making snccessional sowings of those which 
are only of annual duration. 

THE PLANT STOTE. 

Temperature. — From 80 to 85 degs. during 
the day, and 65 degs. during the night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely when the 
action of the sun raises the temperature much 
above that indicated ; but avoid cold or dry 
currents, and shut up early in the afternoon, 
or directly the thermometer indicates a mate- 
rial fall. 

Watering. — Keep the syringe in active use, 
but beware of wetting plants overhead when 
they are dry at the root : water the roots first, 
and then syringe ; an occasional syringing 
with lime water will do good. 

Potting. — Shift all plants that may require 
it before their roots get too much matted 
round the pot : give liberal room to the strong 
growing ones, according to their habits, and 
shade them for a day or two afterwards : pot 
off seedlings so as to have them well esta- 
blished by the autumn, but do not sow any 
more seeds, of shrubby plants especially, if it 
can be avoided, after the beginning of the 
month. 

Insects. — Continue the use of every avail- 
able means for the annoyance or destruction of 
injurious insects as soon as their presence is 
detected, allowing them as little time to rest 
or multiply as possible. 

Achimenes. — Remove those in flow r er to a 
cooler situation, and reduce the allowance of 
water accordingly: encourage the growth of 
those not so far advanced, and stake and tie 
them out as they progress. 

Allamandas, Beaumontias, Echites, and 
other strong-growing climbers, should be en- 
couraged to grow freely by copious waterings 
and syringings ; they should be kept from 
rambling too much by stopping the stronger 
shoots often. 

Alpinias, ffedyckiums, and their allies, 
should be grown as rapidly as possible, removing 
them to a rather cooler and more airy situation 
just before they come into flower. 

Aphelandras, Justicias, Ruellias, &c. — Pro- 
pagate these by cuttings in bottom heat, and 
grow them on ; they will many of them be 
very serviceable in autumn and winter. 

Amaryllids. — Keep these exposed to the 
full rays of the sun, and well supplied with 
water as long as the leaves exhibit signs of 
growth ; afterwards gradually withhold it. 

Begonias. — Encourage the large growing 
species by shifting and free watering, with ex- 
posure to heat and light. 

Burchellias. — Continue the previous treat- 
ment until the plants have fairly done growing, 



and then remove them to a cooler situation to 
mature their wood. 

Cacti. — The free-growing sorts should be 
encouraged to develope themselves by rich 
soil, copious waterings, and full exposure to 
heat and light. The early forced plants will 
have completed their growth ; the supply of 
water should be gradually reduced, and they 
should be placed out of doors in a hot place, 
but sheltered from heavy rains. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — Keep this 
growing freely, but shade it from hot sun, as 
the leaves are apt to blister. 

Clerodendrons. — Remove those in flower to 
other houses ; and push on the others by shift- 
ing and watering freely. Watch closely 
against the attacks of the mealy bug, which 
is very fond of all the family. 

Climbers. — Prevent any loose or straggling 
appearance in the plants by stopping and tying 
in as often as necessary. Provide a due sup- 
ply of water to the roots of such as are turned 
out. 

Daturas. — Keep up the succession of these 
by removing those sufficiently advanced to 
other houses ; and introduce or shift fresh 
plants as required. 

Erythrinas. — Attend to those which have 
been cut in for a second bloom, and take off 
all the shoots but one, two, or three at the out" 
side ; stake those left, and keep the pot 
plunged in bottom heat. "Water freely, and 
guard against the red spider. 

Euphorbias. — If the succulent ones have 
completed their growth towards the end of 
the month, gradually reduce the supply of 
water, until they receive barely enough to keep 
them from shrivelling. Propagate E. fulgens 
for winter flowering. 

Ferns. — Maintain a moist atmosphere and 
subdued light about these plants ; guard against 
stagnant water about the roots. 

Gardenias. — These should be grown freely 
on dung beds, in frames, where they receive 
plenty of light, and have a continually moist 
atmosphere about them : rest some as soon 
as they have completed their growth, for early 
forcing. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Continue the 
previous treatment, removing such as come 
into flower gradually to a drier and cooler place. 

Hippeastrums, Crinums, Pancratiums, &c. 
— Water freely until the leaves cease to en- 
large, then gradually lessen the supply of 
moisture ; but never entirely withhold it from 
such of the species as remain evergreen. 

Hydrangeas. — Keep up a good supply of 
moisture : place the plants under a north walk 
and gradually bring them into the full sun-lightj 
and reduce the amount of water as they com- 
plete their growth. 

Ipomcsas. — Train these as they advance, 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JUNE.

and stop the shoots of the stronger grow- 
ing sorts, so as to expose their flowers to the 
eye ; they soon run into a confused mass. 

Ixoras. — Remove those plants which have 
completed their growth to a cooler situation. 
Encourage the young plants by shifting and 
applying bottom heat. 

Jasminums, Rondeletias, Brunfelsias, &c. — 
Continue to treat as before, removing those in 
bloom to the greenhouse, and exciting others, 
so as to secure a succession of bloom. 

Lantanas. — Those out of flower may be 
turned out-doors into a sunny exposure for a 
few weeks, and may then be cut in, and again 
submitted to heat. 

Luculia gratissima requires to be kept 
growing, and well syringed to keep it clean. 

Lycopodiums are useful for covering out of 
the way places in stoves under other plants, 
and where nothing else will grow ; keep them 
moist. 

Malvaceous plants, as hibiscus, &c, require 
large supplies of water at the root, and great 
attention to keep them clear of the red spider. 

Manettias, and similar climbers, require 
constant attention to regulate their growth ; 
stop them occasionally, to improve their 
shape, by forming side branches. 

Melastomas require great heat and free ex- 
posure to the light, to flower them well : they 
are also very liable to the attacks of mealy bug 
and red spider. 

Melo-cacti. — Continue to grow these in 
strong light and heat, and shift such as require 
it : their roots are large and run deep, and 
require plenty of room to grow in. 

Musas will be growing freely, and should 
be assisted by strong heat and light, and 
abundance of moisture. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher-plant). — Do not let 
these plants be too much disturbed or handled, 
which injures their growth ; continue to sup- 
ply the requisite amount of heat and moisture; 
they require abundance of both. 

Nerlums. — Shift and excite such as have 
been in bad health, keeping them in a moist 
heat ; syringe often ; examine them closely for 
the brown scale. 

Nymphceas (Water lilies) can seldom be 
moved from the house in which they flower, 
as they require all the heat and sunshine that 
can be given to bring them to perfection. 
Shade them in the middle of the day when in 
flower. 

Palms. — "Water and syringe regularly; 
renew the earth about them, if necessary, but 
do not damage the roots. 

Polianthes (Tuberose). — Place those in 
flower in the conservatory, and under shade, 
so rs to preserve the flowers. 

Thuribergias.— Sow a few seeds at the com- 
mencement of the month, to succeed the older 



plants, and pot them off, and stop them as they 
advance. The red spider is very destructive 
of these. 

Vincas. — Let some of them grow away to 
bloom, and keep others stopped back ; pro- 
pagate by cuttings. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 85 to 90 degs. by day, 
and about 70 degs. at night, in the warm 
house. In the cool house, — 75 degs. is high 
enough for the day temperature, and 65 degs. 
for the night. 

Ventilation. — Air should be freely given 
in very hot weather, especially at the top 
sashes ; but do not admit a current of external 
air directly on to any of the plants. 

Watering. — Examine the plants to see that 
they are not dry at the root, before the syringe 
is used. Keep the house damp and the paths 
flooded.: 

Insects. — Never relax in the endeavour to 
keep the plants clear of their many insect 
enemies. Occasionally dip the plants in the 
cistern ; many may be thus got rid of. 

Potting. — A few may require a shift ; but 
great care should be taken of any new 
roots they may have formed; it is best not to 
shift them while in an active growing state. 

Shading. — This should be thick enough to 
cause quite a gloom in the house during the 
brightest sun-light. The few kinds that require 
more light may be set in the most open parts. 

Soils. — Collect all the requisite substances 
in dry weather, and have them at hand for use 
when required. Almost any wood that is not 
resinous will do for blocks ; that of the cork 
tree is found very suitable. 

Imported Plants. — Proceed very cautiously 
with these until they begin to grow freely. 
If newly arrived, keep them in a cooler and 
drier house until they push. 

Aerides, Saccolabiums, and Vandas, should 
still be excited to continue a vigorous growth^ 
by all the appliances within reach. 

Cymbidiums. — Encourage the new growth 
by a plentiful supply of water, and frequent 
syringings over head. 

Ccelogyne. — Rest any of these which may 
have completed their first growth, by removing 
them to a cooler house. 

Dendrobiums, if not all shifted, should 
be examined immediately, and got into a 
growing state as soon as possible. Guard against 
any check to those which are growing. 

Oncidiums. — Syringe frequently, and keep 
the roots damp ; but no water must be allowed 
to collect about the young pseudo-bulbs. 

Stanhopeas. — Continue to excite a vigorous 
growth by liberal supplies of water and great 
heat, but let them have air enough to dry 
them a little now and then.

THE PINK. 




GLENNY ON THE PINK, 

ITS PROPERTIES AND CULTURE. 



Tee Pink is one of the oldest of the ge- 
nuine florist's flowers. The conversion, as it 
were, of single into double races was a work 
of the olden time, and year after year improve- 
ments have been made upon varieties already 
in existence, until some of the modern flowers 
have become in all respects worthy of the 
raisers and of the improved taste of the floral 
public. But there are very few that deserve 
this distinction. The prevailing fault of its 
nature is a serrated edge to the petals, and, 
strange as it may appear, there is so strong a 
disposition to revert to that fault, that many 
of the varieties which have been exhibited 
with perfect rose-edged petals have frequently, 
in untoward seasons, gone back to the worst 
description of serrated petals ; but this has 
been only temporary ; the next season, per- 
haps, the variety has recovered all its better 
qualities. The properties of the perfect pink 



have been already well established. As a 
complete paper on their culture and manage- 
ment should comprise the rules by which the 
value of a flower should be tested, they are 
subjoined : — 

PROPERTIES OP THE PINK. 

The properties of the pink, so far as form, 
substance, and some other particular features 
are concerned, should be the same as those of 
the carnation and picotee. 

1. The flower should be circular, and rise like 
half a ball. 

2. The petals should be thick, broad, smooth 
at the edges, without notch or serrature, regu- 
larly disposed, and each row smaller than that 
immediately under it. 

3. The ground should be pure white ; and 
the colour, whatever it may be — from rose- 
colour to dark red, or from lilac to dark 



THE PINK. 



251 



purple, approaching black — should reach from 
the inside of the petal far enough outwards to 
show in front beyond the petals above it, and 
form a rich eye. 

4. A narrow plain even lacing or stripe of 
the colour, should appear inside the white 
edge, which should be just the same width 
outside the lacing, as the lacing itself is, and 
as even. 

5. There should be no break or vacancy in 
the lacing, and the colour inside of the petal 
ought, as well as the lacing, to be well defined, 
forming a circular coloured eye or centre to 
each row of petals. 

6. Self-coloured petals, split petals, and split 
pods, are disqualifications. Notched or saw- 
like edges, broken or imperfect lacing, specks 
or foul marks on the white, thinness or flimsi- 
ness of texture, looseness of construction, or 
deficiency of petals, are glaring faults. 

7. In a general way, in all other respects but 
the size and colouring, the properties of the 
pink should be similar to those of the carnation 
and picotee ; and no pink ought to be less than 
two inches in diameter. 

The progress of the pink — that is, the tran- 
sition from saw-edged petals to rose -leaved 
petals, as they are improperly called — has been 
slow ; and such is the disposition to a serrated 
edge, that some of the kinds which will one 
season bloom almost without a notch, will in 
other seasons be rough and serrated. But this 
disposition may be conquered by any one 
raiser of new sorts, who will uniformly throw 
away, or give away, all the varieties which 
come at all rough, or which do not exhibit a 
manifest improvement, and reserve none but 
those whose petals, many or few, are of the 
right kind. A semi-double variety with good 
petals is infinitely better to save seed from 
than the most double flowers which are de- 
ficient in that particular ; and no flower offers 
so much opportunity and so much room for 
improvement. 

These rules are now acted upon throughout 
the country, more or less. In some few places, 
however, where the marking of the flower is 
considered of higher importance than the 
form, they still treat the pink as a semidouble 
flower ; and if they can get two rows of petals, 
and two to stick up back to back, they think 
it enough, and therefore exhibit loose, flat, 
ill-looking specimens, which among the floi'ists 
more advanced in taste would be thrown away; 
and as a handsome double flower would make 
such things look very ridiculous, they actually 
pull out the petals of any that would by their 
superior form and character show the semi- 
double varieties off to a disadvantage, and 
reduce them to the miserable state of the ma- 
jority. The varieties, therefore, which will do 
well enough for some localities, would be con- 



sidered a complete take-in if sold in the south : 
but the difficulty of making a man adopt an 
improved race, when it renders all his present 
collection worthless, is by no means easily got 
over; and the facility with which he can raise 
the sorts good enough for such easily pleased 
people, increases the difficulty. In a quantity 
of seedlings raised near London, one great 
improvement in the kinds we already possess, 
in a hundred or two, would satisfy a man, and 
of the remainder which he would throw to the 
dunghill there could be a score semidouble 
varieties that would be acceptable where the 
miserable things we speak of are shown. It 
is, therefore, not likely they should adopt 
hastily a style of pink which would condemn 
their starvelings to destruction ; and that the 
public may not see the contrast they reduce 
our best varieties to two rows of petals, when 
obliged to show them. Time, however, has 
done wonders, and will continue, in spite of a 
vitiated taste and opposing interest, to make 
inroads upon the easily procured but worth- 
less kinds which, for the present, form the 
majority of collections in particular localities; 
though every year lessens the ground they 
occupy, and narrows the influence of the 
florists who obstinately defend a race of flowers 
half a century behind the improvements of the 
southern cultivators. We proceed now to the 
culture of this pleasing but somewhat neglected 
beauty. 

SOIL AND SITUATION. 

The soil best suited for pinks is similar to 
that recommended for all florists' flowers, rich 
in vegetable mould ; and if dung be used it 
should be well' decomposed. There is, per- 
haps, nothing equal to the top three inches of 
a meadow ; this takes in the turf and all its 
roots, and when rotted is of all composts the 
best. It contains sufficient loam for all pur- 
poses, a very large portion of decayed ve- 
getables, and much of the qualities of dung, 
from the feeding of cattle in the pasture. This 
laid together for a year and then turned over, 
and the wire worms, grubs, and other vermin 
carefully picked out, might be chopped to 
pieces, and used in a pink bed ; but for the 
sake of more effectually rotting the vegetable 
matter, and at the same time making a complete 
clearance of vermin, it is desirable to let it 
lie by a second year, during which time it 
should be all turned over four or five times. 
It need hardly be mentioned here, that the 
presence of wire worms is fatal to pinks ; 
there is nothing so destructive, nor so difficult 
to eradicate; salt has no effect on them ; lime- 
water is useless ; they seem to resist all kinds 
of poison, even that which would actually kill 
the plants themselves. While the compost is 
in the heap a vast number may be caught by 



2=19. 



"THE-- PINK. 



thrusting carrots into the heap at various 
places, and drawing them out and examining 
them about once a week, for the wire worms 
attack the carrot with great avidity, and eat 
their way into it ; by drawing them out once 
a week there will be a great number caught, 
and there is nothing that serves so well for a 
trap. It may be observed that almost all 
pastures have these more or less, and it would 
be very unsafe to trust any such soil without 
a thorough examination and clearing. Grubs, 
too, often abound in pasture land ; and 
though the top spit of a loamy field is the 
best of all soil for almost any thing, it requires 
the greatest care on account of the various 
kinds of vermin that are to be found among the 
roots of the grass. But as there may not be 
an opportunity of procuring new soil for a 
pink-bed, the next best thing to do is to dress 
the ordinary soil with a good three inch 
thickness of decayed dung from an old cu- 
cumber or melon bed, or well decomposed 
cow-dung; this three inches should be forked in, 
and mixed with the top spit of the ordinary 
soil, and it will be found well adapted for the 
plants. 

CHOICE OF PLANTS AND PLANTING. 

The best commencement of pink growing 
is to provide or procure plants of some suc- 
cessful cultivator in the autumn, from the 
store bed. See that they are healthy and well 
rooted, and having dug the bed and well 
mixed the dung with it — or if made entirely 
new, levelled the surface — plant the pinks out 
six inches apart all over the bed ; water them 
so as to settle the earth about the roots. With 
regard to the sorts with which to begin, the 
list appended will be of some use as a guide ; 
but as pinks bloom at different seasons, that is 
to say, some rather earlier than others, it is 
right, perhaps, to grow the whole, and they 
are not too many for a collection : —

Many of the distinctions in pinks are very 
slight, and the shades of colour blend so nearly 
into one another, that it is extremly difficult 
in many instances to decide whether it is 
nearer a purple or a red, or a rose and a red; 
but as the chief property is the form and the 
regularity of the lacing, and in the metropoli- 
tan shows the different colours are not classed, 
— the only way in which a difference is recog- 
nised is on stands, where the greater the con- 
trast and variety the better, if all other points 
are equal. 

Most of the growers for sale cultivate the 
whole of these sorts, and many more ; for 
every one is a show pink, and some being later 
than others, it enables us to get a number of 
blooms of different varieties at seasons when 
we could not do it if Ave depended on a smaller 
assortment. Besides this, there are seasons in 
which one flower is much worse than others, 
although in other seasons it would far surpass 
them ; if it were not so, we could get the best 
twelve or eighteen sorts, and grow more of 
each sort ; but we should find ourselves 
always deficient in number of good blooms, 
because they will not all bloom together ; and 
hence the advantage of a more numerous col- 
lection, including pretty nearly all the varieties 
that yield even a chance of a bloom fit to ex- 
hibit. If the plants cannot be procured in 
autumn, or if a person is determined to com- 
mence in the spring, the plants ought to be 
obtained in pots, and such as have been win- 
tered in pots, because these may be planted 
out as late as April, and not be materially 
worse than if they were autumn planted. In 
this case the balls of earth must be turned out 
whole, and should be soaked in manure water 
long enough to wet the soil throughout. This 
manure water may be made with a spade-full 
of dung well decomposed, and a pail-full of 
water, the dung being well stirred about and 
mixed ; some of this may be put in a shallow 
pan, and only enough of it to reach two-thirds 
up the balls, which may be placed in the liquid 
about five minutes, whence they are put, with- 
out being disturbed more than is necessary, 
into their places. Water the bed well, that 
the earth may be closed about the roots ; 
and if there be any danger of frost, it will be 
well to throw over the whole bed some loose 
or light stuff, such as peas-haulm or broken 



THE PINK.

straw, not to shut out the light, but sufficient 
to keep off the sun and wind for a day or two. 
They will soon establish themselves. The 
object in soaking them is this: — If the balls of 
earth, as they are turned out of the pots, are 
placed in the bed dry, it will be difficult to 
wet them all through by merely watering them 
in, because they are so much more compact 
than the bed ; and if properly established in 
the pots the roots will be completely matted. 
Next to soaking the balls is watering the pots 
well before they are turned out ; but this is 
not so well as soaking, because when they are 
watered in the pots they do not turn out so 
clean, whereas if they are soaked afterwards, 
and put in their places carefully, they set off 
growing directly, and frequently bloom equal 
to autumn planted pinks. In two or three 
days after they have been put out, the litter 
may be removed, and be only replaced when 
there is a prospect of a frost, the last thing at 
night, to be taken off in the morning. In a 
week or two they will be fully established, and 
will require no more protection. 

TREATMENT UP TO BLOOMING, 

The bed must be occasionally refreshed with 
water if there be no rain, and the ground be- 
comes dry ; but none should be given while 
the earth is moist, which will often be the 
case when the surface is very dry, and this 
may be ascertained by stirring the earth a 
little an inch or two down. Those which have 
been planted in autumn should have a top 
dressing of well rotted cow-dung ; and before 
this is laid on, the soil should be stirred with 
a hoe, and the lumps bruised. The cow-dung, 
or if it cannot be obtained, the decomposed 
dung of a common hot-bed, should be run 
through a coarse sieve, and laid on an inch 
thick all over the bed, and well round the 
plants, so that when watered, or in the event 
of rain, it may get washed in among the roots, 
and encourage the growth. 

BLOOMING. 

When the plants throw up their flowering 
spikes, the strongest of each plant should be 
saved, and all the others taken away : only 
one spike should be left to the strongest plants, 
and as these develope their buds, they should be 
reduced to two or three at the most. As these 
swell and approach the timeof bursting, eachbud 
should be tied in the middle with a piece of bass 
matting, or coarse worsted ; and as soon as they 
are ready to burst, the calyx should be carefully 
torn down to the tie, at all the divisions, that the 
petals may be developed on all sides alike. At 
this period cards should be placed on the calyx, 
to lay the petals down upon as they come out : 
the mode of fastening the card is simple enough, 
but it requires attention ; for instance, there 




should be a circle drawn in the middle, about 
as large as the pod of the bloom, and with a 
sharp knife there should be cuts made across 
the circle four times at equal distances, the 
second cut exactly crossing the first, and the 
third and fourth cuts being made exactly half 
way between them, as represented : this being 
done, the circle should be opened 
by thrusting the point of a pencil, 
or round piece of wood through 
it, and pressing the points out to 
the extent of the circle. The 
card is then cut through, to 
allow the stem to pass, and it is to be placed 
on the bud, with the points downwards, and 
brought up the bud so as to form an under 
support to the lower or guard petals. By 
placing a stick in the ground with a wire 
stuck in it, and bent at the top into a sort of 
ring like the annexed sketch, the card may be 



held up in its place ; the wire is bent thus, and 
the end of it is pointed, and thrust into the 
stick; but there is a description of soft copper 
wire, which does not require more than to be 
bent round the stick, and can be moved up and 
down it, or bent a little up or down, so as to 
hold up the card. The sticks and wires may 
be thus explained ; — the wire keeps the card 




from slipping down, even if it has a disposition 
to do so ; the card, however, when the points 
are cut properly* and the hole made of a 
right size, will almost hold itself up ; but this 
contrivance supports the bloom stalks, and 
keeps every thing steady in its place. The 
flowers must now be shaded, and frequently re- 
freshed with water. The bestshade is an ordinary 
small hand-glass,^. 1, held up by a short stake, 




Jig. 2, up and down which the glass moves, by 
means of a socket, through which the -Stake 



254 



THE PINK. 



passes ; and by a peg fixed in one of several 
holes, it is kept firm. The advantage of this 
is, that the shade can be thrown over the glass 
in a moment, and taken off morning and 




evening, leaving the glass, which protects 
the flower from wind and rain, and gives 
it the benefit of all the light. The shades 




F^3 

may be made of pasteboard, or paper, or 
may consist of a cabbage leaf, or any other 




object that will keep away the sun. A sort of 
shade is represented by the cuts 3 and 4. The 
pegs are placed about two inches higher than 
the flower, and the glass shading dropped on to

Fig. 7. 



the stick; figs. 5, 6, and 7. The shades should be 
always handy. In a cloudy day they are better 
off than on, but they should be always put on 
when the sun is out, and indeed, in light, clear 
weather, and when the bloom is advancing to- 
wards perfection there should always be a 
shade, if it be only a slight one, like part of a 
newspaper. In very hot weather the shading 



must be heavier. "We have seen shades painted 
green and lead colour, but they cannot be too 
pure a white, for dark colours absorb heat, and 
form an oven for the flower, at the same time 
that they keep off the bright rays of the sun, 
and close heat is nearly as destroying as sun- 
heat. In proof of the advantage of light 
colours, try the experiment of painting one 
tin shade white; and another black, place them 
in a hot sun, and you will hardly be able to 
hold the black one, while the white one will 
not be hot. As the petals begin to open, the 
large or ground petals should be carefully placed 
down on the card, so as to form an outer layer, 
like a dish almost, and these should in a good 
flower form a circular outline ; they will not 
all do so, and indeed, those which are very 
perfect in this particular are at present rare. 
The next in size, -as they open, should be 
brought down in a similar manner, and the 
centre of each should cover the join where 
the two outer or lower ones meet and fold 
over. In like manner, as the flower advances, 
a third row should be disposed, so as to hide 
the joins in the row below, and if a fourth or 
fifth row could be formed of good well rounded 
petals, there is no reason why it should not be 
done ; but there will mostly be some confused 
petals in the middle ; pull out such as are 
really useless, or are all of one colour, for a 
run petal, that is, a petal, however small it 
may be, without white in it, would be fatal to 
the whole stand of flowers, although only in 
one bloom. When the flower is cut, and 
wanted for the stand, the petals having been 
placed as they grew out, will require very 
little dressing — perhaps hardly want touch- 
ing ; see that a crown is formed if possible 
with a couple of petals back to back, or two 
or three small ones standing up ; and be 
careful to preserve the horns of the flower, if 
there be any, for it adds so much to the grace 
and elegance of a pink, that one might almost 
be pardoned for making it a point in the pro- 
perties : but there are exceptions ; they are 
sometimes ugly, and must come away ; they 
are at other times unnecessary, on account of 
the high and handsome crown formed by the 
petals ; and now and then the horns are dis- 
coloured, and in no wise improve the appear- 
ance of the flower. 

PIPING THE PINK FOR PROPAGATION. 

At and after blooming, the grass, as it is 
called, at the bottom of the flower stem, that 
is to say, the shoots of the plant, that would, 
if left, bloom next year, and form a large old 
plant, should be taken off and struck under a 
hand-glass, on slight bottom heat on very rich 
soil. Make up a hot-bed, with about eighteen 
inches in height after settling, of hot stable- 



THE PINK. 



255 



dung ; upon this put about three to four inches 
of good sifted soil, such as we have described 
for growing pinks in. Having collected all 
the sprigs or shoots that are large enough 
from tbe plants in flower, and tied them up in 
bunches as they are gathered, with a label to 
designate their names or sorts, prepare them 
for striking. Take hold of the upper part, but 
as low down as you want to secure them, and 
pick off the heel or bottom joint; then, if there 
be any stem below the joint, cut it off with a 
sharp knife close under the joint ; strip off a 
few of the lower leaves, that there may be a 
stem to thrust into the soil : then place your 
glasses on the soil of the hot-bed, to make a 
mark of their size ; with a very fine watering 
pot give the soil a good wetting without dis- 
turbing it, and thrust in your pipings to the 
depth of the stem you made, but do not, as has 
been the practice with those who ought to 
know better, shorten the leaves ; put them in 
two inches apart all over, or if pressed for 
room, an inch and a-half apart ; we have 
seen them only an inch, but it is not advisable 
to crowd them. As you proceed, place the 
label to each sort in such way as you will 
know how to separate them after they are 
rooted. When the space is filled, take a small 
watering pot, and give enough water to settle 
the earth about the stems, and cover them up 
with the glasses, as soon as the water has sunk 
in, and the surface has dried a little. There they 
remain till they strike root, shaded from the 
sun, and occasionally watered in dry weather ; 
but the watering may be done without for 
days together, in consequence of their being 
confined under the glasses ; and it may be 
easily seen whether there is moisture enough 
in the ground or not, because too much wet is 
mischievous : examine them therefore occa- 
sionally, to see if there be any lack of 
moisture, and only give it when required. It 
will soon be seen when the plant has struck 
root, and the glasses may then be removed, 
but not too suddenly, and they must not have 
the broiling sun. Now prepare a bed, as if it 
were for fresh planting out, and put them out 
in it three inches apart instead of six ; this 
will hold a vast additional number. From 
this bed all the intermediate plants may be 
withdrawn for other beds, or for sale, or for 
potting to protect in frames through the 
winter, or for any other purpose. 

SECOND SERIES OF PIPINGS. 

After the grass, as it is called, has been 
taken from the main plants, there is a strong 
second growth, which frequently makes better, 
and always furnishes surer plants than the first 
crop. These pipings, when they are large 
enough, may be served in the same way as the 



first, but they require more care, and are 
generally more tender than the first : these will 
strike, however, quite as readily with care, and 
when well struck, which is of course much 
later in the season than the first, they should 
be planted out as the others, three inches apart; 
but these are well adapted for pot culture 
through the winter, as they may be kept 
growing in frames without getting them too 
forward. 

POTTING FOR WINTER. 

The plants best adapted for this treatment, 
and that require it most, are the weakly and 
the late pipings. These should be put out one 
in a pot of the large sixty (three-inch) size, 
and in the same soil that is recommended for 
blooming them. These pots should be partly 
filled with the compost, cone fashion, lightly 
put in, the roots of the plants spread round 
the stem outwards a little, and other soil put 
in and pressed down a little: the object of this 
is to have the roots sloping down the side of 
the cone, and the soil put up to the collar of 
the plant, and no higher. Very few plants 
thrive when put lower than they were before 
in the soil ; the only exceptions are those plants 
which rapidly develope roots at every joint, 
and therefore make fresh demands on the soil 
at a proper depth, when their previous roots 
are lower than they have been. These pots 
should be put into a cold frame, and be covered 
up with the glasses for a day or two, close, first, 
however, being watered, to settle the earth 
about the roots, and allowed to drain. If the 
sun becomes too powerful they must be shaded. 
In a day or two they should have air by tilting 
the glasses, still being shaded ; but when once 
established in their new location they may have 
all the air and rain until the winter creeps on, 
when being in small pots, and the roots touch- 
ing the side, they ought to be matted in severe 
weather. 



DISPOSAL OF THE PLANTS FOR BLOODING. 

"We have now brought round the new plants 
to the place we set out at, chiefly to direct 
that those which have been planted only three 
inches apart must now be reduced to the 
number that stand at proper distances ; all the 
intermediate plants being removed, unless it 
has been already done. The spare plants must 
be put into fresh beds, or into the borders, or 
be otherwise disposed of; and the beds dis- 
turbed by their removal must be stirred all 
over with a small hoe, without damaging the 
roots of the plants, and, when properly regu- 
lated, have its top-dressing. All the remaining 
plants in pots must be turned out somewhere ; 
or, if there be any reason to suppose they will 



256 



THE PINK. 



-be required by those who are improving their 
collections, as indeed choice ones frequently 
are, you may repot them in rich compost, in 
large forty-eight size (five-inch) pots, or thirty- 
two (six-inch) size ; that is to say, the ordinary 
compost two-thirds, and one-third decayed 
cow dung, or thoroughly decomposed dung 
from a melon-bed, the additional richness 
-compensating for the confinement of the roots. 
These may be bloomed quite fit for- cutting, 
and some of the largest and most double 
varieties will not only bear to be bloomed in 
pots, but will carry all their buds to perfection, 
and yield flowers quite large enough to exhibit 
with ordinary sorts. 

PINKS FROM SEED. 

We need hardly say here that seed should 
be only saved from the very best varieties, 
those which are approved as approaching 
the standard — with thick petals, very round 
flowers, full, double, and rose-edged, colours 
dense, lacing good, and very regular ; such as 
these will chance to give a good progeny. 
The seed should be preserved in its pod till 
sowing time, for which the spring is best, as 
the plants get large enough in autumn to stand 
the same hardships as the pipings that are 
struck. Sow according to the quantity in pots, 
boxes, seed-pans, or in the soil itself, under a 
garden light and frame. Let the compost be 
the same as you would grow in. The seed 
must be sown evenly and not too thick, as it 
is better to have to mend the vacant places 
with seedlings taken from the thickest parts 
than to have them too much crowded any- 
where. As soon as the plants are large 
enough to prick out, prepare a bed as if for 
blooming, and plant them out four inches apart 
in the row, and six inches between the rows; 
or if room be scarce and seedlings plenty, do 
it three inches apart all over: here they may 
wait till they bloom, taking care that as fast 
as single or semidouble ones show themselves 
they are pulled up and thrown away, even 
before they can contaminate the seed of better 
ones : put sticks, shades, and cards, to any that 
are really promising, and clear off all others 
as fast as possible. Seedlings often bloom 
more vigorously than pipings, therefore it is 
rarely worth saving one with the hope of its 
improving, except the stool be large and the 
flowers numerous, in which case they will cer- 
tainly bloom larger another season. Although, 
from people being in too great a hurry to sow, 
they get large stools, and often, from the im- 
mense quantity, and the knowledge that 
ninety-nine of every hundred are not worth 
keeping, will not take the trouble to lessen the 
flowering stems or disbud them, until too 
late to keep the flowers, it is better to be 



careful of the seed, and treat the seedlings as 
if all were worth preserving. Suppose any 
one of them should be deemed worth notice, 
pipe all the grass of it as soon as it is large 
enough, and continue to pipe any other that 
grows, as fast as it arrives at a state to bear 
it ; and in all respects treat it afterwards as 
you would an approved variety. 

MONTHLY TREATMENT. 

January. — Protect the beds of pinks with 
litter, or hoops and mats, against excessive 
frosts and falls of hail or snow. Those in pots 
under glasses must be protected in like man- 
ner, as the frost easily penetrates the thickness 
of the pot, against the sides of which the roots 
lie. 

February. — Continue the treatment of last 
month, but give all the air you can in the 
mild weather. 

March. — If a fine open month, the beds 
may be hoed, the soil well bruised, and a top- 
dressing of dung, well decomposed, put all 
over it. Plants in pots ought to be now 
turned out in beds, or where they are to bloom. 
New beds may be formed with strong-rooted 
plants, removed with great care ; but they 
must not be expected to give flowers so good 
as those planted in autumn. Sow seed. 

April. — Plant beds from pots, and even 
from store beds, if neglected until now, but with 
diminished chances of bloom from the store 
beds, though good chance of success from pots. 
Hoe and top-dress, if not done before. Sow 
seed. 

May. — Weed the beds carefully, and occa- 
sionally hoe or stir the surface a little, without, 
however, injuring the fibres. If the weather 
be dry and parching, do not omit watering — 
not merely each plant, but soak the whole bed. 
Towards the end of the month, as the bloom- 
stems rise, remove all but one from each 
plant; put sticks to the remaining ones to tie 
them up to. 

June. — Weed the seed-beds as well as 
the blooming beds, and also seedlings in pots, 
for while in this state they are easily over- 
run and killed ; many small weeds, chick- 
weed in particular, twining their shoots all 
about the young plants, and killing them out- 
right for want of nourishment. Disbud all 
the flower-stems, leaving only the number you 
wish to bloom ; place the stakes ready to tie 
them up, if it was not done last month. As 
the flower-buds swell, tie them half way down 
with bass or even worsted, and tear down 
the calyx to the tie ; as the guard leaves, or 
petals, develope themselves, commence the 
dressing by placing them in their proper places; 
put on the shades, and give abundance of water 
in dry weather. Commence piping. Examine 



THE PINK. 



257 



blooming seedlings, and throw away the worth- 
less ones : prick out seedlings if too thick. 

July. — Early in the month proceed with 
piping ; continue to weed and water seedlings 
of the present year: others, blooming seedlings, 
must be treated just the same as the named 
flowers. Towards the latter end of the month 
there may be other grass ready to pipe ; con- 
tinue to prick out seedlings of the present year, 
if too thick. 

August. — Continue piping the after-grass 
as long as there is any ; and now is the best 
time to bring in plants piped in June. If 
they are carefully removed from the piping- 
bed, with plenty of root, you can do as you 
like w T ith them. The seedlings require weed- 
ing and watering as usual. Towards the end 
of the month you may plant them out in the 
store-beds, the seedlings of the present year. 

September. — There is little to do but 
plant out late pipings, and pot those intended 
for the frames. Hoop over the beds intended 
to be protected with matting or cloths, and 
continue making blooming beds, and planting 
out. 

October. — Continue to plant out late pip- 
ings, and make blooming beds: pot pipings for 
frames : protect the seedlings of this year with 
matting or litter, in case of frost or cutting 
winds. 

November. — It is not too late to make beds, 
or plant out and pot late pipings and seedlings. 
Be careful of frost ; use litter or mats, and 
never put them on in mild weather, except at 
night. 

December. — Adopt the usual precautions 
for the winter months. Be always ready to 
cover against heavy rains, hail, snow, frost, &c; 
and give all the air you can in mild weather. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

The Pink is called a monster flower, from 
the fact that although there are generally petals 
that would fall into their natural places with 
assistance, there is nothing to guide them in a 
general way, because the double flowers are, 
while in the pod, a solid mass of petals, 
crowded to the extreme, each swelling and 
growing as it may, on a base as fine as a thread, 
powerless in the direction of such a weighty 
upper portion. The flower, therefore, requires 



the aid of the florist as its petals are developed. 
In some very double kinds, the largest petals, 
that should be the first to fall down, are often 
crowded up into the centre of the bloom, among 
the small ones that should be uppermost. 
Those which have the thickest petals in a ge- 
neral way require the least aid ; and those 
which are not extravagantly double will fre- 
quently require little or no dressing. 

The cultivation of pinks in pots for exhibi- 
tion as such, has been frequently talked of as 
a desirable thing to accomplish ; but this, if 
done at all, will be done by the exhibitors of 
plants. Florists accustomed to cut off their 
blooms, and carry them in a small box with 
little or no trouble, cannot be reconciled to the 
practice of carrying a dozen, eighteen, or 
twenty-four pots, which will require a cart ; 
and if we look to the plantsmen to show 
them, they will never take the trouble to card 
and tie and dress the flowers. This has been 
considered the reason why pinks have not been 
shown in pots. 

Pink Societies generally give their new 
members a dozen pairs of pinks to begin with, 
and most of them give a prize for what are 
called maiden showers — that is, showers who 
have not exhibited before. This is to en- 
courage young beginners, whose productions 
are not expected to equal even the losing 
stands among the old ones. How much better 
is it to adopt this mode of increasing the 
number of pink growers, than it is to discourage 
any attempt, by showing them at the very first, 
that it is hopeless to compete with these who 
have the advantage of experience. 

It has been the strangest thing imaginable 
to see a perfect stand of pinks ; the very best 
we ever saw was exceedingly faulty : and such 
is the varied character in Avhich this flower will 
come occasionally, that we have known three 
or four blooms cut off the same plant and shown 
in a stand as different varieties. But although 
this was a manifest fraud upon the people who 
were competitors, it would not be so in the 
metropolitan society ; the rule there is, that the 
blooms shall be dissimilar : so that while two 
or three flowers might be cut off one variety, 
and pass because they were really unlike each 
other, two of different varieties might, by being 
too much alike, throw out the stand.

COXIFERJE. THE ABIES, OR SPRUCE FIR. 








Abies canadensis. 



COXIFERiE.— The Abies, or, Spruce Fir. 



Aeies, Don (the Spruce Fir). — The deri- 
vation of this name is from the -word abeo, to 
rise or mount, in allusion to the towering 
habit of the tree. — Evergreen trees. 

* Leaves spreading equally round the 

hranches. 
Abies excelsa, Don (lofty, or Norway 
Spruce Fir). — Leaves distributed regularly 
over the branches, mucronate, four-cornered, 
solitary, of a deep grassy-green colour, stiff, 
nearly an inch in length, wound up close to 
the branches. Cones from five inches to seven 
inches in length, cylindrical, pendulous, w r ith 
slightly-toothed scales at tip, wavy, and of a 
light brown colour. 

A long-lived, majestic tree, affecting the 
mountainous districts of the north of Europe, 
and frequently attaining to the height of 150 
feet. It is furnished with long, drooping, 
fan-like branches, which are disposed in a 
regular feathery strata from top to bottom, 
and is considered by many to be very orna- 
mental. No tree is affected more by the nature 
of the soil in which it grows. In dry exposed 
situations it becomes stunted, the branches at 
the bottom of the tree being almost devoid of 
verdure. In valleys, and on slopes of hills, 
where the soil is somewhat moist and deep, 
and in a north-east aspect, it shoots up amaz- 
ingly, and covers itself with the richest ver- 
dure to the very surface of the soil. Under 
this aspect both the poet and painter have 
taken delight in contemplating it. This 
species seems to accompany Nature in her most 
striking and picturesque places. It is common 
throughout the mountainous parts of Norway, 



Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and France. 
Russia and Siberia, too, have it in consider- 
able perfection embosomed between some of 
their highest mountains ; and it is asserted, 
that in some instances it lives in degrees of 
cold which even the Scotch pine will not 
survive. Though not indigenous to Britain, 
this tree has been common in this country 
from the earliest times. It is evident, how- 
ever, that in England it will not attain to any- 
thing like those dimensions which it assumes 
on the hills of Norway. 

As a timber tree, the spruce fir is of the 
greatest value. It produces the white deal 
or white Baltic deal and Memel log of com- 
meree ; and in Britain an immense quantity 
of the wood is used in the shape of scaffolding 
poles, ladders, masts, planks, and deals. It is 
light and elastic, less resinous than the Scotch 
pine, yet lasting longer than that of any other 
species except the larch, over which it has an 
advantage in not being so liable to warp. In 
its living state, when young, it is admirably 
adapted to shelter other trees in exposed situ- 
ations ; and certainly no tree-nurse is equal 
to it in defending tender plants from the 
effects of frost. The resinous substance ex- 
tracted from this tree, after being boiled in 
water and strained through a cloth, is the Bur- 
gundy pitch of our shops. An ordinary sized 
tree will, for the space of twenty years, yield, 
every other year, at the rate of 401bs. ; but, 
as might be expected, this process ultimately 
destroys the tree, for after that time it begins 
to decay, and is speedily taken possession of 
by myriads of insects. In a climate like that 



CONIL'ERiE. THE ABIES, OR SPRUCE FIR.

of Britain, variable and uncertain, this tree 
deserves to be propagated extensively, if it 
were only to furnish close evergreen branches, 
which are better than anything else in afford- 
ing shelter to tender crops. The first crop of 
peas which have to brave the severities of 
winter, should be always protected with spruce 
branches. Peach, nectarine, plum, and pear 
blossoms, are often brought to maturity solely 
through their aid ; and every careful and suc- 
cessful nurseryman knows how much he is 
indebted to them in protecting his laurel, 
cistus, bay, and aucuba cuttings ; his ever- 
green oak, cistus, and arbutus plants ; and a 
host of his seeds whilst vegetating during 
spring frosts. By them, therefore, a gardener 
may materially lessen his anxiety during the 
months of February, March, and April. In a 
pinetum where half-hardy plants are intro- 
duced, they must be of essential service. In 
Finmark, where nothing is lost, the tips of the 
branches are mixed with oats as food for horses. 

But let us consider it in a higher office. As 
an ornamental plant, it is regular, symmetri- 
cal, and aspiring, very beautiful on a lawn 
where the soil is deep, loamy and free, because 
in such situations it ascends from the grass a 
complete pyramid of green. So far from its 
having anything of that clipped-like browsing 
line, by far too prevalent in our parks, it lays 
down its branches unreservedly on the grass, 
so that the stem is hid amidst a profusion of 
verdure. Of course, there are many trees of 
this species which do not look well. Huddled 
up amongst others, without its favourite soil, 
it becomes a miserable stunted thing, fit only 
to be burned ; but, as already observed, in 
good damp soil, it is well entitled to be con- 
sidered an ornamental plant. There are some 
splendid specimens, well feathered to the 
ground, near Brandon in Suffolk. 

The cones of the spruce fir are ripe in 
January. They should be gathered from free 
growing trees only, and immediately placed on 
a kiln, with a moderate heat, for a day, and 
then taken and thrashed to pieces. In order 
that the seeds should be properly protected 
during this process, the floor on which they are 
laid should be formed like a causeway, with 
round stones, so as the seeds may have shelter 
between them. It is important also to keep the 
cones sufficiently thick on the floor, so that 
the flail may not reach the seeds. When sifted, 
they should be kept in a dry airy situation till 
the time of sowing, which is the third week of 
April for England, and the first week in May 
for Scotland. Light loamy soil is to be pre- 
ferred to any other, and on no account should 
any manure be given. 

The soil should be very finely raked, the 
beds made four feet and a half in width, and 
the covering only half an inch in depth. In 
these beds the plants may remain for two 



years, when they should be set out in lines 
nine inches apart, the plants in the lines being 
two inches apart from each other. In that 
state they may remain for two years more, 
when they may again be transplanted into lines 
fifteen inches apart ; and the plants in those 
lines at intervals of four inches. When two 
more years in this last situation, they will be 
quite fit to be removed to their final situation. 
One year's seedlings are Is. Qd. per thousand, 
and transplanted plants are from 6s. to 30s. per 
thousand. (1847.) 

Varieties. — These are very numerous, and 
have been greatly increased by Continental 
nurserymen, who lay hold of the slightest 
variations in order to fill up their catalogues. 
The following are the chief varieties which 
some may consider worthy of enumeration. 

A. e. nigra (black -leaved Spruce, or, as it 
is sometimes called, the red Fir). — The foliage 
is darker and more robust, and the wood is 
more resinous than the common tree. It seems 
to stand in the same relation to the species as 
the Highland pine, or Pinus sylvestris hori- 
zontalis does to the common Scotch fir, and 
is well worthy of cultivation. 

A. e. carjmtica (Carpathian Spruce Fir). 
— A vigorous growing variety, similar to the 
foregoing, but of lighter foliage. It is culti- 
vated by Mr. Knight, Nurseryman, King's 
Road ; and there is a fine specimen at Drop- 
more, about twelve feet high. 

A. e. pendula (weeping-branched Norway 
Spruce Fir). — The common tree merely. 

A. e, foliis variegatis. — A stunted plant, 
having the leaves blotched with yellow. It is 
cultivated for sale by Knight and Loddiges ; 
and a tree in the garden of the Horticultural 
Society has been planted about twenty years. 
A. e. Clanbrasiliana (Lord Clanbrasil's 
Spruce Fir). — A variety first introduced by 
Lord Clanbrasil, on whose estate it was found. 
It is of little use, except as a botanical curi- 
osity, being a low compact growing bush, 
seldom growing over a yard high. 

A. e. Clanbrasiliana stricta,, — A variety, 
according to Loudon, found at Florence Court 
by the gardener, who represents it as forming 
a beautiful little shrub for a lawn. 

A. e. tenuifolia. — A plant with slender 
shoots, and which, when grown up, will in all 
probability become more pendulous than the 
species. It is cultivated in the Exotic Nursery, 
King's Eoad. 

A. e. ]y/gm<ea, identical with A. e. nana of 
some catalogues, and in all probability the same 
as A. e. Clanbrasiliana. 

A. e. gigantea, not seen by the writer, but said 
to be more robust and stronger than the species. 
A. e. monstrosa, a mere continuation of one 
of those monstrosities frequently found among 
spruces, laburnums., brooms, and exuberant 
plants of the Scotch pine, rlius, &c.

CONIFERS. THE ABIES, Oil SPRUCE EIR. 



In Knight's Nursery, King's Road, are va- 
rieties, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, but as the plants 
are small, it is impossible as yet to speak with 
confidence, regarding them. 

Abies orientalis, Tournefort (Oriental 
Spruce Fir). — Leaves short, solitary, less than 
half the length of those of A. excelsa, imbri- 
cated, quadrangular. Cones ovate, cylindrical, 
with soft rounded scales. 

Found by Tcurnefort on the mountains 
above the Convent of St. John's, south-east of 
Trebisond ; and subsequently by Sir Gore 
Duseley, on the precipitous and sublime banks 
of the Kur at Teflis. 

Some botanists consider the plant as be- 
longing to A. alba ; and in Loudon's opinion 
it is a mere variety of A. excelsa. The tree is 
as yet uncommon in Arboretums ; but there 
are young plants in Knight's Exotic Nursery, 
King's Road. 

Abies alba, Michaux (white Spruce Fir). — 
Leaves spreading equally round the branches, 
quadrangular, three-quarter inch in length, of 
a glaucous hue. Cones of a lengthened oval 
shape, pendulous, with thin, even, undivided 
scales of a light brown colour. 

Found with A. nigra in Canada, New 
Brunswick, and the district of Maine. The 
tree assumes the general form of the last 
mentioned species, though not its loftiness, 
and the bark of the older specimens is of a 
much whiter hue. The foliage is also charac- 
terized by a silvery cast, so that in the forest 
it has a much more cheerful appearance than 
either A. excelsa, or A. nigra. It is very 
hardy, but produces inferior timber ; so that 
Mr. Lambert's recommendation to plant it ex- 
tensively on the mountains of Britain has not 
been responded to. In this country it is short- 
lived, and frequently assumes the appearance 
only of a stunted shabby-looking tree. In 
deep free soil, at the bottom of a hill, with an 
eastern exposure, it puts on a luxuriant and 
beautiful aspect, and feathers itself close to the 
surface of the ground. As a timber tree, it is 
rejected ; but the fibres of the roots, after 
being steeped in water, are split, and used in 
sewing together canoes of birch bark, the 
seams of which are coated over with its resin, in 
order to render them water-tight. This spruce 
has been in this country for nearly a century 
and a half, and it appears that even under the 
most favourable circumstances, it does not 
grow higher than sixty feet. Two years' 
seedling plants are common in the nurseries, 
and are to be had at 7s. 6cl. per thousand. Farn- 
ham Castle in Surrey, Cool in Galway, 
Ballyleady in Down, White Knights, and 
Dropmore, are the places in Britain where it 
has attained the greatest perfection. 

Variety. A. alba nana, raised in the 
Chester nursery, is a dwarf plant, a specimen 



of which is in the Chiswick arboretum. Many 
botanists and nurserymen pass it over as un- 
worthy of distinction. 

Abies nigra, Aiton (black Spruce Fir). — 
Leaves spread equally about the branches, 
or solitary, short, straight, and quadrangu- 
lar, and of a dark dull green. Cones of an 
ovate-oblong form, nearly two inches long, and 
when ripe, of a dusky red colour. Seeds 
a little larger than those of the preceding 
species. 

A straight-growing tall tree, introduced 
into this country in 1700. A native of 
swampy valleys in the most inclement parts of 
North America, growing chiefly in humid 
peat-like soil, where it is loose and deep. Not- 
withstanding what has been said to the con- 
trary, it is believed that this tree is rather nice 
in the selection of the soil in which it grows 
freely ; and that in mountainous districts where 
the ground is poor and thin, it would scarcely 
attain to a height beyond forty or fifty feet. 
Though the countries in which this tree 
abounds are diversified by hills, the finest 
forests are invariably found in valleys between 
those hills, and on the sides of mountains 
where the soil is good, and the situation some- 
what sheltered. 

This spruce forms a dense growing tree, 
perfectly pyramidal in its shape, and when 
covered with its young cones, a very beautiful 
picture. The scenery in Franklin's Polar 
Expedition affords good examples of the effect 
of this tree in landscapes ; and for living illus- 
trations, the reader is referred to Longleat, 
Pain's Hill, and Finborough. 

The timber of this tree is of the greatest 
u-e in America, being strong, light, and 
elastic, not so good for flooring as the Pinus 
Strobus, but yet extensively employed in the 
dockyards, especially for the yards and knees 
of vessels. It is also exported to England, and 
used in our manufacturing towns for making 
packing boxes. The essence of spruce is ex- 
tracted from the young branches of this tree ; 
and it is from this species that the well known 
spruce beer is made. Young plants are plen- 
tiful in the nurseries, and those which are two 
years old, are to be had at 10.*. per thousand. 
Such as are four years old, having been two 
years transplanted, are the fittest for waste 
lands. It is a mere waste of time and money 
to plant this tree on soil which has not been 
loosened (trenched) to the depth of two feet. 
Those who are in the practice of planting 
larch and Scotch firs on hard mountain land, 
which has never been prepared, may deem 
trenching an unnecessary expense. Experi- 
ence, however, will undeceive them in this 
respect. Recent experiments go to show that 
this tree is well adapted to grow in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood of the sea. 



CONIFERS. — THE ABIES, OR SrilUCE FIR. 



261 



Abies rubra, Poiret (red Spruce Fir). — 
Leaves equally distributed round the. branches, 
awl-shaped, slender, and with sharper points 
than the foregoing. Cones larger and redder 
than those of A. nigra, and more resinous, and 
having notched scales. A tree very much 
resembling A. nigra; and it is very ques- 
tionable if it is entitled to be considered dis- 
tinct. Its wood is as good as that of the 
foregoing, and its rate of growth in this 
country is the same. One of the finest speci- 
mens in England, is at Hackress, in Yorkshire, 
where it is sixty-five feet high. A variety 
called ccerulea has been originated by Mr. 
Booth, of the Flotbeck nurseries ; and along 
with it, Mr. Knight of King's Road propagates 
a variation called gracilis. These latter are 
propagated by cuttings only. 

Abies Smithiana, Wallich (Smith's Spruce 
Fir). — Leaves somewhat compressed, slender, 
straight, sharp pointed, pale green, somewhat 
glaucous, arising from a faint silvery line in 
the grooves. Cones solitary, pendulous, ovate- 
oblong, seven inches long, with round brown 
smooth scales. 

A beautiful Himalayan tree, quite as hardy 
and growing as freely in Britain as the com- 
mon spruce. It is bej^ond any question that 
this is one of those plants destined to occupy 
a prominent place in the English Arboretum, 
and in woods ; for it is not only very orna- 
mental, but it is reputed as being a tree which 
produces excellent timber. The writer has 
had cones and seeds sent direct to him from 
the Himalaya, and two years' seedlings in his 
nursery are quite equal to those of the common 
spruce of a like age. It promises to have some- 
thing of the gracefulness of the Deodar, the 
tips of the branches assuming a drooping di- 
rection ; and altogether the tree promises to 
have nothing of that stedfast gloom which is 
characteristic of several trees of the genus. 
Plants from four to six inches, are 6s. per 
dozen. (1847.) 

* * Leaves fiat, glaucous beneath, two- 
rowed, or nearly so. 

Abies Douglasii, Lindley (Douglas's 
Spruce Fir). — Leaves spreading almost 
equally round the branches, or imperfectly 
two-rowed, silvery beneath, and blunt. Cones 
terminal, ovate-oblong, bright brown, with 
round concave smooth scales. Seeds of an oval 
shape, bright brown. 

A magnificent tree, discovered by Douglas, 
in immense forests, from 43° to 52° north 
lat. in North-west America, and one with 
regard to which British Arboriculturists 
might well evince some interest. The opinion 
of Dr. Lindley, given some years since, to the 
effect that it would suit this climate, and prove 
a valuable tree, is, so far as experience goes, 
correct ; for there are already some fine trees 



scattered throughout the country, which are 
producing cones in abundance. According to 
Douglas, the trunks of this species in its native 
forests are from two feet to ten feet in dia- 
meter, and from 100 feet, to 180 feet in 
height ; and he mentions, that a stump which 
he found near Fort George, on the Columbia 
river, exclusive of the bark, and at three 
feet from the ground, measured 48 feet in 
circumference. On the banks of the Colum- 
bia, and in the other districts of North-west 
America where it prevails, the trees are to a 
great height devoid of branches, the top being 
of a conical shape, and the bark of a greyish 
brown, very rugged. In England, where it is 
yet planted only as an ornament, it is apt to 
become bushy like the Cedar of Lebanon, and 
to throw up several leaders ; but when it is 
planted in groups, at about four to five feet 
apart from each tree, it will be found to 
assume a much better character in the eye of 
the timber merchant. A tree ten years old 
grows in this country at the rate of eighteen 
inches a year. In Northumberland, at Whit- 
field Hall, which is rather an ungenial climate, 
being 750 feet above the level of the sea, it 
has reached the height of 40 feet ; the circum- 
ference at 2 feet from the ground, is 3 feet 
and 6 inches, the length of some of the 
branches near to the ground being 14 feet, 
and the circumference of the branches at 
bottom, 90 feet. It is thickly furnished with 
luxuriant branches from the ground upwards, 
and Mr. Ord, in the Gardeners' Chronicle, ob- 
serves, that " it would certainly have been 
5 or 6 feet higher, but from the misfortune of 
its having twice lost its leading shoot." Mr. 
Ord further adds that, ." three years ago, a 
shot from a gun pierced the leading shoot, and 
this year (1846) a severe hail storm broke it 
down. In one respect, I am more fortunate 
than Sir C. Lemon, at Carclew, for I have 
fifty fine young plants raised from the seed of 
last year, but which had a narrow escape from 
death by the same hail storm that broke the 
leading shoot of their parent, and were only 
saved by the gardener rushing out with a 
hand-glass ; they would otherwise all have 
perished. I have two or three fine plants 
raised from layers, which seem to be putting out 
shoots on all sides, and growing well and up- 
right. There are no cones upon the tree this 
year." A large specimen is in the garden of 
the Horticultural Society, and there is another 
fine tree at Dropmore. In the pinetum at 
Rozelle, Ayrshire, this species grows luxuri- 
antly. 

Though unquestionably producing valuable 
timber in its native country, there is no evi- 
dence as yet to establish its claim when com- 
pared with other timber trees in this country. 
Lindley has given it as his opinion, that it is 



262 



CONIEEE.E. THE ABIES, OR SPRUCE FIR. 



" likely to prove more valuable than even the 
larch itself." Plants one foot high are 
7s. 6d. each. 

Variety. Abies D. taxifolia. — A variety 
with foliage resembling the yew, raised from 
seeds received from the late Mr. Thomas 
Drumruond, after the Arctic expedition. An 
upright growing tree, both stem and side 
branches being straight. Leaves longer than 
in the species, and of a much deeper green. 
The finest tree of this variety in this country 
is in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and 
young plants of it are to be had at Knight's, 
and Loddiges'. 

Abies Menziesii, Douglas (Menzies's 
Spruce Fir). — Leaves very short, acute, 
whitish beneath, almost regularly spread round 
the branches. Cones oblong, with thin, ovate 
ragged scales ; the cone nearly three inches 
long. 

A native of the northern parts of California, 
where Douglas discovered it. In its general 
appearance it resembles A. Douglasii, but it 
does not attain the altitude of that tree. It was 
named by Douglas in honour of his friend, 
Archibald Menzies, Esq., the botanist. The 
wood of the tree is represented to be very 
valuable, probably as much so as that of 
A. Douglasii, and from the great numbers of 
it which are cultivated throughout Scotland, 
there is no doubt of its being hardy enough 
for Britain. The remarks of Mr. Locke of 
Rozelle, on this species, are particularly 
worthy of notice. " This beautiful Spruce," 
he says, "in one situation, with us, is thriving 
well, making shoots of two and three feet a 
year ; while in another situation, within a very 
short distance, it is not doing well. In the 
first case, the situation is shaded, and more 
damp, while the other is duly exposed to the 
sun, and upon a very dry bottom. I have 
remarked, that all plants belonging to the 
spruce and silver firs, delight in deep, damp, 
and shaded situations, especially when young ; 
and I conceive the reason to be this, — that on 
light soils with open exposure, the growth 
begins earlier, rendering it liable to injury 
frona spring frosts." Fine specimens may be 
seen in the Chiswick arboretum, at High- 
clere, and Hendon Rectory. 

Abies canadensis, Michaux (Canada Pine 
or Hemlock Spruce Fir). Leaves flat, soli- 
tary, two-rowed, or nearly so, downy when 
young, with rough, serrated margins, of a 
beautiful light green, with silvery lines on the 
under side. Cones small, ovate, a little longer 
than the leaves, hanging on the extremities of 
the branches. Scales round, smooth, and 
entire at the margins. 

A native of the bleakest parts of the new 
world, as far north as Hudson's Bay, in lat. 
•51°. The vast evergreen forests of Nova 



Scotia, New Brunswick, Vermont, and the 
elevated districts of New Hampshire, are 
chiefly of this tree ; but in those immense 
tracts it does not assume the graceful outline 
by which it is so easily recognised in this 
country, for when old it becomes stunted, and 
in many instances shattered and broken by 
snow lodging on its rigid branches. Towards 
the south, it becomes scarce, and is there 
found only on dark and humid exposures. 
Under. its best aspect, it forms a noble tree, 
rising to the height of 80 feet, with a trunk 
about 3 feet in diameter at the surface of the 
ground. 

American writers represent its wood to be 
indifferent ; and in that country, where so 
much wood is used for external coverings, its 
decaying so rapidly when exposed to the 
atmosphere, forms a material objection to it. 
However, when guarded from humidity, it is 
said to last as long as any other pine, so that 
large quantities of it are consumed in the shape 
of laths for the inside of walls. The bark is 
valuable for tanning, and is by many con 
sidered more valuable than that obtained from 
the oak. 

As an object on the lawn or pleasure ground, 
this tree is well entitled to be considered orna- 
mental. It is a dense grower, yet its spray 
falls about it in elegant flakes ; the colour of 
the foliage is of a cheerful silvery hue, un- 
changeable; and therefore, amongst evergreens, 
occupying that place which the birch and 
weeping willow do amongst deciduous plants. 

It is raised from seed annually imported 
from America, Germany, France, &c, and 
even in this country some old trees produce 
cones. The seeds are sown in the middle of 
April, in free loamy soil, covered to the depth 
of a quarter of an inch, and in those beds the 
plants are allowed to remain for two years 
previous to being transplanted. Two years 
seedlings are from 40s. to 50s. per 1000. 

Abies duviosa, Lambert (bushy Alpine 
Spruce Fir). — Leaves flat, solitary, turned one 
way, linear, obtuse, with a whitish bloom 
underneath. Cones solitary, ovate, erect, 
terminal, small, with ovate blunt scales. 

A fine tree, very much resembling A. cana- 
densis, attaining the height of 80 feet, and 
found in the northern parts of India, in 
Nepal, Butan, and surrounding districts. The 
trunk, to the height of 20 feet, is free from 
branches, and it is covered with an ash- 
coloured brownish bark. The leaves are so 
very deciduous, that Wallich states that the 
slightest shake of the branch is sufficient to 
detach them. The wood is bad, and is re- 
jected by the natives, chiefly on account of its 
liability to warp. This plant is not yet in the 
catalogues of the first London nurserymen, 
and the presumption is that it is not to be had 



CONIFEIUE. THE ABIES, OR SPRUCE FIR. 



263 



in England. There is little doubt of its prov- 
ing quite hardy in this country. 

Abies obovata, Don (obovate-leaved Spruce 
Fir). — Found in the Altaic Mountains, and in 
all probability a variety, or variation only, of 
Abies Smithiana. Cones drooping, cylindrical, 
with abruptly dilated scales. The tree is not 
yet to be had in England, but it is sufficiently 
hardy for this climate. 

Abies Mertensiana, Bougard (Mertens' 
Spruce Fir). — A tree mentioned by Bougard, 
in his work on the island of Sitcha, on the 
western coast of North America, but unac- 
companied by any description. 

Three other species or varieties will be found 
in Knight's Exotic Nursery, under the names 
of elegans, laxa, viminalis; and also a fourth 
species, said to be from New Holland. Mr. 
Knight himself expresses a doubt with refer- 
ence to all these ; and until they are better 
known, no certain opinion can be given con- 
cerning them. 

The four following kinds have to be added 
from books and manuscripts, being, as Lindley 
says, " almost unknown." 

Abies JCcempferi. — A native of Japan, 
found wild upon the mountains of Fako ; called 
by the natives Leosi. 

Abies Thunbergii. — A native of Japan, and 
cultivated in the city of Jeddo. 

Abies Morni. — A native of Japan, the 
wood of which is in great estimation on ac- 
count of its whiteness and fine grain. 

Abies Torano. — A native of Japan. 

Abies AraragL — Also a native of Japan, 
producing brown wood, used for various 
domestic purposes. 



The foregoing is one of the most important 
sections of Coniferse. From the regularity of 
growth assumed by most of the species it will 
at once appear that, viewed merely as orna- 
ments, pruning them is a most dangerous 
experiment ; and when it is considered that a 
few cuts will cause them to part with a great 
deal of their resinous- sap, the practice should 
by all means be discontinued. 

There are no trees perhaps which will better 
repay the exercise of a little judgment in 
selecting spots of soil most suitable for them. 
This fact is abundantly clear from the differ- 
ence of growth and appearance exhibited by 
the common spruce, which may be made either 
to exhibit the most unsightly appearance, or 
the most beautiful and luxuriant garb which 
vegetation puts on. A damp, free, loamy soil 
appears to be most suitable for all the 
individuals of the Abies family; and as recom- 
mended in other instances, the trenching of the 
soil is a great point in their favour. 
' It is but lately that attention has been 
directed to the adaptation of trees to certain 



situations. The vast and almost immeasurable 
tracts of waste land lying along the sea-shore 
were, until a few years since, considered as 
shut out from the pale of vegetation ; and 
hence we find such districts bare, treeless, and 
uninviting. The black spruce (Abies nigra) 
has been found to brave the effects of the sea 
air admirably ; and for such places it may 
be confidently recommended. It not only 
stands well itself, but from its thick evergreen 
spray, it is well fitted to shelter other less 
hardy kinds, which without such a nurse could 
not be introduced. 

It is the fashion now-a-days to propagate 
great quantities of the rarer kinds of Spruce 
Firs by cuttings; but this practice is censurable. 
The trees never assume the outline and vigour 
of seedlings ; and it is very questionable if 
they ever partake of that rigidity of fibre 
exhibited by the wood of such as have been 
raised in the natural way. If so, how is it 
that they are- so short lived ? 



According to the views of some botanists, 
the genus Abies is made to include, beside the 
Spruce Firs, three other groups known by 
the popular names of Silver Fir, Larch, and 
Cedar. The question is not a very important 
one, since the groups are on both hands held 
to be distinct ; but as they are most commonly 
recognised in this country as distinct genera, 
and are better known under the names they 
thus bear, we have thought it desirable, chiefly 
on this account, to prefer the separate arrange- 
ment. Under this plan, the Silver Firs bear 
the generic name of Picea, the Larches, that 
of Larix, and the Cedars, that of Cedrus ; 
while the genus Abies is limited to that group 
of species commonly known as the Spruce Firs. 

It may be worth while here to add some of 
the common characteristics by which these 
groups may be distinguished. It will be seen 
that they consist chiefly of features of habit 
and appearance, the real differences — those of 
structure— upon which the distinction of 
genera should rest, being very slight, if at all 
existing : — 

Abies consist of species, whose cones are 
more or less conical, and in all cases 'pendant ; 
the leaves are evergreen, and scattered in their 
insertion,, that is, they grow out singly from 
the branches — not in tufts, nor two ranked. 

Picea consists of species which bear erect 
cones, mostly long, and generally cylindrical ; 
the leaves are evergreen, and two ranlied. 

Larix consists of species with small ovate- 
conical erect cones ; the leaves are decidu- 
ous, and grow in little tufts or branches. 

Cedrus consists of species which bear large 
erect cones ; the leaves grow in little tufts, 
but they are evergreen.

SKETCHES OF CREATION. 



PICTURESQUE SKETCHES OF CREATION.* 

The difficulties which present themselves to 
the mind when we speculate on the creation of 
this vast universe, or inquire into the proba- 
ble or possible origin of the globe we inhabit, 
have given rise to numerous theories as wild 
and incomprehensive as can be imagined; and 
when we have learned all we can learn, we 
are lost in the contemplation of our own 
insignificance, and of the vast magnitude of the 
subject we would grasp, and its distance 
beyond the reach of our finite understanding. 
Geologists have endeavoured to supply a 
theory that will reconcile their facts with the 
origin of the globe. As we learn much of the 
history of the ancients by the monuments they 
have left behind them, so the geologist en- 
deavours to compass the history of the creation 
by the antediluvian remains which annually, 
nay, daily come under their notice ; but even 
the most intelligent of them are yet at an 
immeasurable distance from the truth, though, 
to uphold the science of historical geology, (if 
we may be allowed to use the expression.) a 
theory or foundation of some kind is necessary, 
and it is accordingly supplied. The author of 
the present volume has collected many valu- 
able facts, and he has endeavoured to make 
them subservient to the view which he takes 
of the earth's origin and gradual develop- 
ment. The Mosaic description of the crea- 
tion so warps the mind of many who do not 
make allowance for anything figurative or im- 
perfect in the original record or its transla- 
tions, that they recoil with horror from an 
inquiry which seems to involve a doubt as to 
the genuineness of the Bible ; — we say seems 
to involve a doubt, because in truth it does 
not raise a dispute as to the important facts 
stated in the book of Moses. "In the begin- 
ning" God created the earth, we are told, 
and this, be it remarked, is without a date ; 
the beginning might have been millions of 
years before the work of creation that con- 
cerned man. Then we are told that the earth 
was without form, and void. The geologist 
makes much use of the period in question, — 
before life or animation existed on the face of 
the earth, — before there was an animal or a 
vegetable ; and the boldest of the writers on 
the subject — (and some of them go extreme 
lengths to reconcile matters with their own 
reasoning faculties) — the boldest question not 
the fact of the creation, because it is no less 
the work of the great Creator, be the means 
employed what they may. Our author, in this 
case, speculates on the earth having been

once a ball of matter on fire and in a state of 
fusion. He says : — 

" Judging from the general appearance of 
the solar system, and combining the result of 
astronomical observations on distant bodies in 
the universe with the appearance presented by 
various rocks on the earth's surface, it seems 
not unlikely that, at a very early period of its 
history, our globe existed as an intensely 
heated body in a fluid state, (the fluidity being 
the result of igneous fusion,) and that it 
gradually cooled at the surface, perhaps by 
exposure in space, contracting in dimensions 
as it cooled and hardened. In this manner, 
it may be, a succession of thin solid crusts 
were formed, each in succession shrinking and 
cracking, until at length, when a certain 
balance was arrived at between the thickness 
of the crust, the rate of cooling, and the 
amount of internal heat, there would be left 
a rough uneven surface, having many eleva- 
tions and depressions, its temperature being 
sufficiently reduced to allow of the existence 
of seme such atmosphere as now surrounds it, 
and also permit the permanent presence of 
water in a fluid state reposing in the hollows, 
and forming seas, lakes, and oceans. During 
the whole of this time, and until the existence 
of water in the liquid state, and the establish- 
ment of a sea, and perhaps long afterwards, 
it is likely that there were no living beings on 
the earth ; because, so far as we know, nei- 
ther animal nor vegetable can exist, and per- 
form its functions, at the temperature of water 
actually boiling, — although, at a temperature 
not much short of that, some small animal- 
cules, and even some animals of higher organ- 
ization, would seem capable of enjoying life. 
Thus, therefore, according to this view,— and 
the reader will understand that it is merely 
offered as the most probable explanation of 
certain appearances observed, — the first period 
of the existence of the earth as a planet was 
marked by a chaotic state of igneous fusion, 
and characterised by frequent disturbances of 
the surface consequent upon cooling from such 
a state. Let us consider for a moment what 
kind of rocks are exhibited to us when we 
examine these earliest records of our globe, 
and let us see also how far we are able to ex- 
amine them. 

" In the first place, we often find, as the 
basis of all other rocks in mountain chains, 
and throughout some extensive tracts of 
country, a well-known rock called granite ; 
a rock whose structure is crystalline, and 
which bears strong marks of having cooled 
slowly from a state of intense heat. This 
rock is found in all parts of the world, and 
sometimes in widely extended masses." 

There are more extraordinary theories than 
this ; but to satisfy the minds of our sceptical

friends, we may say the world was not the less 
the handywork of the Creator, if thus pro- 
duced, than if called into existence in its 
present form. Besides these unquestionable 
evidences of internal fire, witness the volca- 
noes, and external evidences of fusion in the 
various metals in the state that fire alone could 
leave them : however, this is digressing;, — 
the author is quite capable of working out his 
own case without our assistance. If among 
the facts produced by geologists, we are 
shown things that are incredible unless we 
witness them, and yet they are pointed out 
that our own senses may be exercised for our 
conviction, we may give credence to much 
that they say, not so well within reach of our 
observation. For instance, when they tell us 
that enormous rocks are formed by the secre- 
tions and remains of certain minute animals, 
that mountains are raised by the mere living 
and dying of myriads of small creatures, the 
careless observer or the non-observer may 
feel indisposed to believe it ; but there is no 
more doubt of it than there is that the Pyra- 
mids of Egypt were built by men, though we 
did not see them in hand. We did not see the 
coral reefs building any more than the Pyra- 
mids of Egypt ; but there they are with the 
evidence on every inch of vast mountains ; 
and we see others now in progress, and rising 
so rapidly as to occasionally make it necessary 
to alter our navigation charts ; — a coral rock 
under water, out of all reach of vessels, 
within the memory of man, becoming so 
augmented as to cause the loss of vessels by 
striking, where, a comparatively short time 
previous, there was no danger within reach. 
Speaking of the accumulation of rock from 
the mere work of small creatures, individually 
as nothing, the writer says : — 

"The prodigious extent of the combined 
and unintermitting labours of these little 
world-architects must be witnessed, in order 
to be adequately conceived or realised. They 
have built up four hundred miles of barrier 
reef on the shores of New Caledonia ; and on 
the north-east coast of Australia their labours 
extend for one thousand miles in length ; and 
these reefs may average, perhaps, a quarter 
of a mile in breadth, and one hundred and 
fifty feet in depth, and they have been built 
amidst the waves of the ocean, and in defiance 
of its fiercest storms. The geologist, in con- 
templating these stupendous operations, learns 
to appreciate the circumstances by which were 
deposited in ancient times, and under other 
conditions than those which now characterise 
our climate, those mountain masses of lime- 
stone, for the most part entirely coralline, 
which abound in many parts of our native 
island. The most abundant remains of corals 
in these masses are similar in their general 



nature to living species, but indicate animals 
very distinct from those living polyps which 
are now actively engaged in forming similar 
deposits on the undulating and half-submerged 
crust of the earth washed by the Indian and 
Pacific oceans. The limestones, which form 
a part even of the oldest formations, offer 
distinct proof, by their organic remains, that 
they are due to the secretions of gelatinous 
polyps, the species of which perished before 
those that formed the newer strata were cre- 
ated ; and, as these polyps of the older period 
have been superseded by those of the present 
day, so these, in all probability, are destined 
to give way in their turn to new forms of 
essentially analogous animals, to which, in 
time to come, the same great office will be 
assigned, — to clothe with fertile limestone 
future rising continents." 

The theories broached by the geologists 
suppose, that, from the period when the world 
first became habitable, even to the lowest 
order of animals and reptiles, there was a 
succession of new genera and species, and a 
decay of old ones, and that the various strata 
of the earth were formed each of the 
organic remains of various families, some 
altogether extinct, totally unlike anything 
known in the present day, and only figured 
and described from their bones, teeth, scales, 
impressions of their feet, localities, and other 
evidences, complete up to a certain point, 
but after or beyond that imaginary. Some of 
those remains are of gigantic proportions and 
monstrous formations. The races of animals 
existing at the periods of the various forma- 
tions appear to have been very distinct, and 
in some geological works an attempt has been 
made to represent the periods by figures of the 
various living creatures supposed to exist at 
the time. In the work before us there is a 
frontispiece describing the vegetation of 
England during the coal period. These things 
being, in part, accomplished by analogy, 
drawn from fragments actually found, may be 
pretty nearly accurate. It is quite clear, from 
the discoveries of organic remains, that all the 
animals in the creation were not introduced 
at once, and as clear, that with the animals 
were also introduced the vegetation or other 
food and circumstances necessary for their 
existence ; it is also clear, that as whole fami- 
lies, genera, and species have become extinct, 
the circumstances necessary to their existence 
have been changed. There are those who, 
referring to the Mosaic records, find, or satisfy 
themselves that they find, a sufficient cause for 
all the effects spoken of by geologists in the 
simple but awful single occasion of the flood ; 
— the overturning of mountains, the washing 
out of vallies, the various precipitates of differ- 
ent substances, the changing of vallies into

SKETCHES OF CREATION. 



lulls, of seas into dry land, and vice versa ; 
but the geologist attributes the changes to 
time alone, and measures the different epochs 
by the various deposits. Thus, we find our 
author, in regular succession, dividing all 
time into different periods. For instance, 
the period antecedent to the introduction of 
life, and the deposits of rocks, on which there 
are no remains or evidences of a living crea- 
ture having existed : then the period of ex- I 
istence of invertebrated animals as the most j 
highly organised inhabitants of the sea ; the 
Silurian rocks : next, the introduction of j 
fishes ; the characteristic animals of the 
second fossiliferous period ; the Devonian, or 
old red sand-stone system of formations : next j 
comes the appearance of land, and the intro- j 
duction of land vegetables ; the carboniferous 
system, and the close, as it is called, of — I 
(we speak geologically) — the first epoch of! 
creation, indicated by the magnesian lime- j 
stone, or primary system of deposits. This 
epoch is the first of three great geological I 
divisions of the world's history, and the com- 
mencement of the second is distinguished by 
the formation of what is called the new red 
sand-stone. Then came the marine reptiles, 
and other animals characteristic of the lias ; 
then the gigantic land reptiles, ; the flying 
reptiles, and other animals characteristic of 
the Oolitic and "Wealden formations. From 
this the author proceeds to the consideration 
of the inhabitants of the earth during what is I 
called the cretaceous period, and a wind up of ! 
the secondary epoch, and the circumstances of ! 
its termination. All this is before the intro- 
duction of land animals, and the commence- 
ment of the so-called tertiary period, which j 
is called the third or modern epoch ; and 
herein are found the remains of extinct mon- 
sters, the skeletons and portions of which are j 
to be found in our public and private museums, 
and are ably described in the remaining chap- 
ters of the work. An account of a mammoth 
we can hardly abstain from noticing. There 
is something particularly interesting in the 
fact of bodies being preserved in ice. The 
author says : — 

" In the latter part of the summer of 1799, 
a native Tungusian fisherman, who was in the 
habit of collecting tusks for sale from among 
the blocks of ice and rubbish which had fallen 
from the cliffs, saw on the banks of Lake 
Oncoul, near the mouth of the Lena river, 
and projecting from the cliff, a mass of unu- 
sual form, but, from its shapeless appearance, 
he could make nothing of it. The year after, 
proceeding to his usual haunt, he noticed that 
this lump was somewhat disengaged and had 
two projecting parts ; and towards the end of 
the summer of 1801, when he again looked at 
it, he found it to consist of the whole side of 



a gigantic animal having large tusks, one of 
which projected from the ice. So slowly do 
changes take place in these districts, that the 
next summer being rather cold, no alteration 
was to be noted ; but in 1803 part of the ice 
between the earth and the monstrous animal 
was somewhat more melted than before, till 
the whole at length fell by its own weight on 
a bank of sand. Next year our fisherman 
came in the month of March, and cut off the 
tusks, which he soon sold for about the value 
of 50 roubles (about 7/. 10s.) Two years 
after this, in 1806, being the seventh year 
from the discovery of the carcase, these dis- 
tant and desert regions were traversed by Mr. 
Adams, an employe of the Court of Russia ; 
and his account of the rest of the history of 
this mammoth, the ancient elephant of northern 
Europe, is too interesting to be abridged, 
without the loss of much of its value as a 
vivid description of so extraordinary a phe- 
nomenon. 

" Mr. Adams states, ' At this time I found 
the mammoth still in the same place, but alto- 
gether mutilated. The prejudices being dissi- 
pated in consequence of the Tungusian (who 
had fallen sick from alarm on first hearing of 
the discovery, because it was considered a bad 
omen) having recovered his health, there was 
no obstacle to prevent approach to the carcase. 
The proprietor was contented with his profit 
for the tusks, and the Jakutski of the neigh- 
bourhood had cut off the flesh, with which 
they fed their dogs ; during the scarcity, wild 
beasts, such as white bears, wolves, wolverines, 
and foxes, also fed upon it, and the traces of 
their footsteps were seen around. The ske- 
leton, almost entirely cleared of its flesh, 
remained whole, with the exception of one 
fore-leg. The head was covered with a dry 
skin ; one of the ears, well preserved, was 
furnished with a tuft of hairs. All these parts 
have necessarily been injured in transporting 
them a distance of 7330 miles, (to St. Peters- 
burgh,) but the eyes have been preserved, 
and the pupil of one can still be distinguished. 

" ' The mammoth was a male, with a long 
mane on the neck. The tail and proboscis 
were not preserved. The skin, of which I 
possess three-fourths, is of a dark grey colour, 
covered with reddish wool and black hairs ; 
but the dampness of the spot, where it had 
lain so long, had in some degree destroyed 
the hair. The entire carcase, of which I 
collected the bones on the spot, was nine feet 
four inches high, and sixteen feet four inches 
long, without including the tusks, which 
measured nine feet six inches along the curve. 
The distance from the base or root of the tusk 
to the point is three feet seven inches. The 
two tusks together weighed three hundred and 
fixty pounds English weight,, and the head

alone four hundred and fourteen pounds. The 
skin was of such weight, that it required ten 
persons to transport it to the shore ; and after 
having cleared the ground, upwards of thirty- 
six pounds of hair was collected, which the 
white bears had trodden in while devouring 
the flesh.' 

" A part of the hair of this animal is in the 
Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of 
London. It consists of two sorts, common 
hair and bristles ; and of each there are several 
varieties, differing in length and thickness. 
That remaining fixed in the skin is thick-set 
and crisply curled ; and it is interspersed with 
a few bristles about three inches long, of a 
dark reddish colour. Among the separate 
parcels of hair, are some rather redder than 
the short hair just mentioned, about four 
inches long, and some bristles, nearly black, 
much thicker than horse-hair, and from twelve 
to eighteen inches long. 

" Thus, then, we find that the elephant of 
the north temperate and Arctic zone was in 
most respects exceedingly like the species now 
inhabiting India, and, with the exception of a 
warm woolly and hairy covering, offered but 
little modification of structure. It was said by 
the native who discovered the carcase, that it 
had been so loaded with fat, that the belly 
hung down below the joints of the knees. 
The food of the creature was probably twigs 
and the branches of trees ; and herds of these 
gigantic quadrupeds may possibly have mi- 
grated northwards in warm weather to the 
limits of arboreal vegetation, where from time 
to time individuals were buried either alive, 
or soon after death, in an icy shroud, and 
where the bones of those who died from 
natural or violent causes were also buried and 
preserved in the frozen gravel.'' 

As we have before observed, there is in 
this book nothing that is inconsistent with 
revealed religion, — nothing opposed in reality 
to the Mosaic record of the creation, if we 
make due allowance for the changes, or at 
least modifications, in the generally accepted 
meanings of words. Indeed, the concluding 
words of the volume are impressive, and 
confirmatory of the view we have taken as to 
its general tone. After a general review, the 
author says : — 

" Nor can it be understood as a less noble 
or less striking proof of creative power, that 
in this great plan, according to which our 
globe was created, everything should be fore- 
seen and provided against, that everything 
should succeed in its time and place, that each 
organized being should perform the task 
allotted to it, and retire when its work was 
done, having assisted to carry pn, without 
interruption and without interference, the 
great and uniform system. The perfect rela- 



tion of each animal and vegetable to the time 
and place allotted to it is no less marked and 
certain than that admirable adaptation of every 
part in the individual, which is* known to be 
so necessary to its comfort and even its exis- 
tence. The whole system is one, it is the 
result of one mind, of one will, of one power. 
It is governed by a few simple laws, which 
no power but that Avhich instituted them can 
possibly interfere with, and which, so far as 
we can judge, never have been interfered with. 
It is permitted to man to become acquainted 
by careful observation with some of the 
methods thus adopted, and the laws imposed ; 
and the power being given, it is surely incum- 
bent on him to employ it, humbly indeed, and 
cautiously, but earnestly and with an honest 
desire to discover truth, whatever that truth 
may be, or however it may clash with his pre- 
conceived opinions." 

The work is illustrated with well executed 
engravings, like all similar works published 
by Mr. Van Voorst, and the binding is novel, 
substantial, and elegant. 




SAXIFRAGA GERANIOIDES,. 

(Linnceus,)' 
GERANIUM-LIKE SAXIFRAGE. 

Saxifraga. is a very extensive group of 
small hardy herbaceous plants, of which nearly 
or quite all are worth cultivating in gardens. 
There are at least two hundred reputed 
species, of which some are small tufted plants, 
with finely cut leaves, well adapted for cover- 
ing rock-work, producing short flower stems, 
and always neat and interesting, even when 
not in bloom, from their close habit of growth, 
and lively green colour ; others have broader 
leaves, more or less notched at the edges, and 
grow up with an erect branching flower stem 
from one to two feet high, with numerous, 
though small, and exceedingly pretty flowers; 
of these the London pride — one of the best of 
all for thriving in the smoky atmosphere of 
towns and cities — is a familiar example. 



268 



THE DROSERA, OR SUNDEW. 



Saxifraga geranioides belongs to the for- 
mer of these groups. It is a small tufted 
plant, having stiff reddish suckers, a red stem, 
growing six inches high, covered with glandu- 
liferous hairs, and bearing a compact branch- 
ing panicle of white blossoms ; the leaves are 
on footstalks, reniform in outline, with from 
three to five lobes, the segments wedge-shaped, 
and deeply toothed ; they are pubescent. The 
flowers consist of five oblong flat petals, of a 
white colour, arranged in something like a 
bell-shaped figure ; the filaments are yellow- 
ish ; the little stalks which support them, and 
the calices, are covered with clammy down ; 
they are produced in profusion during the 
months of April and May. This plant is a 
native of the Pyrenees, and was introduced to 
our gardens in 1770. It is the same as the S. 
paniculata (Schleicher), and the S. quinque- 
fida (Lamarck). 

A variety which bears the name of ob- 
tusiloba, differs in having its leaves some- 
what less toothed, and in being altogether 
less hairy ; its flowers also are borne some- 
what in an umbellate manner. This is a 
native of Switzerland, and is the same as 
the S. geranioides (Schleicher). Both are 
hardy perennials. 

These saxifrages require no protection, 
and are among the best plants for furnishing 
a rockery ; they are also very suitable for 
planting as edgings to walks, especially in 
shrubberies, and in cool, somewhat shaded, 
situations. They grow freely in any common 
garden soil, and should be planted early in 
autumn or in spring ; in the former case they 
get well established before severe weather 
sets in. Spring planting, however, is perhaps 
the most certain, although unless very strong 
plants are used, and they are well watered, 
should the weather prove dry, they will not 
bloom well the first season, when planted late 
in spring. 

When collections of these plants are put 
together in beds, it is desirable that each plant 
should have three or four largish lumps of 
stone placed around it, close to its branches, 
forming a rude embankment round it ; within 
these stones the soil may be slightly elevated 
above the general level, so that the plants 
when so planted are less liable to suffer from 
excess of moisture. The same mode of plant- 
ing is desirable for these and other small 
plants, when planted into a mixed border. 
Another advantage of this mode of planting is 
that the hoe and the rake are less likely to 
inflict injury on the plant when they are being 
used about it. 

They are very readily propagated to any 
extent by dividing the plant, each little crown 
of leaves being capable of becoming a separate 
individual. 



THE DROSERA, OR SUNDEW. 

The Droseras are singular and interesting 
bog- plants, of which several are known to 
botanists, and three species inhabit our own 
country. The trivial name, Sundew, most 
probably originated in the peculiar appearance 
of the plants ; the leaves are fringed or set 
with glandular hairs which exude, and each 
support a small drop or globule of a pellucid 
liquid like dew, which continues even in the 
hottest part of the day, and in the fullest ex- 
posure to the sun ; hence, no doubt, the name 
of Sundew. It is called in Latin Ros-Solis, 
which is the same as the English Sundew. 
They are among the most curious of plants, 
and as such deserve attention, but not being 
at all showy, either in or out of blossom, it is 
chiefly for their curiosity that their cultivation 
can be recommended. Associated, however, 
with the fly-trap (Dio?uea muscipida), the 
side-saddle flower (Sarracenia purpurea, and 
others) and plants of this character, a very 
interesting group is brought together. 

The Droseras belong to a small natural 
order called Droseraceaa, nearly related in its 
botanical characters to the Fumitories, and 
the Berberries. From Fuinariaceas they differ 
in having regular and symmetrical flowers, in 
which the stamens alternate with the petals, 
and from Berberidaceas they are distinguished 
(among other differences) by having regular 
and symmetrical flowers, in which the stamens 
are opposite the petals. These three orders 
form part of a group which Dr. Lindley calls 
the " Berberal alliance." 

The character of the genus Drosera is thus 
defined : — Calyx, deeply five-cleft ; 'petals, 
five ; stamens, five ; styles, three to five, 
deeply bifid ; capsule, one celled, with three 
to five valves, many seeded. Small herbaceous 
plants, having leaves covered with beautiful 
glandular hairs. We shall chiefly confine our 
remarks to the British species. 

Drosera rotundifolia, Linnaeus (round- 
leaved Sundew). — A small herbaceous peren- 
nial, forming when out of blossom a roundish 
tuft three or four inches in diameter of orbi- 
cular depressed or spreading leaves, of a green 
or sometimes purplish colour, beautifully 
covered with red hairs, terminating in large 
glands, which secrete a viscid fluid, which 
retains insects which settle on them ; the hairs 
on or near the margin of the leaves are 
usually longer than the others ; the underside 
is smooth, and the stalks slightly clothed with 
simple hairs. From the centre of this tuft of 
leaves rises the erect flower-scape from two 
to six inches high, which is of a reddish 
colour and leafless, curved at the top, and 
there producing a one-sided raceme of 
small white flowers, each of which, as it

successively occupies the apex of the perpen- 
dicular part of the scape, expanding, but if 
the day be not sunny it never expands at all, 
but the next above it does when it arrives at 
the apex ; the flowers consist of five oblong 
petals, when expanded forming a little star. 
It is common in mossy bogs, and wet heathy 
ground. Flowers in July and August. 

Drosera longifolia, Linnaeus (spathulate- 
leaved Sundew). — A small herbaceous peren- 
nial, in size and habit much resembling D. 
rotundifolia. In this species however the 
leaves are spathulate, very obtuse, and grow 
erect on long glabrous petioles ; they are 
greenish-purple, and furnished as in the others 
with pink glandular hairs. The flowers are 
small and white, and grow in a curved one- 
sided raceme, at the top of the scape, which in 
this species, instead of rising perfectly erect 
from the root, is curved or decumbent at the 
base, erect in the upper part. It is found in 
mossy bogs, and wet heathy ground, not un- 
common, but more frequent in the south than 
in the north. It flowers in July and August. 
A variety having shorter leaves, and the 
flower-scapes shorter than the leaves, has been 
found in Ireland. Also called D. intermedia, 
(Reiehenbaeh). 

Drosera anglica, Hudson (great Sundew). 
— A small herbaceous perennial, but growing 
twice the size of the last. The leaves are 
numerous, obovate-lanceolate, obtuse, erect, 
on long glabrous petioles, of a pale purplish 
green, clothed with red glandular hairs. The 
scape grows erect from the root, and is curved 
at the apex, bearing there a one-sided raceme 
of small white flowers, which are produced in 
July and August. It is found in similar situa- 
tions with the others, but less frequent ; it 
is more common in Ireland. A variety with 
broader leaves, and affording some minute dif- 
ference in the blossoms is met with in Scot- 
land. It is also called D. obovata, and D. 
longifolia (Heyne). 

The Droseras possess an acrid principle, 
which, according to Withering, is, in our na- 
tive species, " sufficiently caustic to erode the 
skin ;" but he observes, " some ladies know 
how to mix the leaves with milk, so as to make 
it an innocent and safe application to remove 
freckles and sunburn." He also adds, that the 
juice which exudes, unmixed, will destroy 
warts and corns. The Droseras also possess 
an acid property, and, according to some, are 
poisonous to cattle ; they have been charged 
with having the power of causing the rot in 
sheep. It was at one time supposed that the 
leaves possessed the same irritable property as 
those of the fly-trap : but their mode of en- 
tangling the flies seems altogether different. 
Instead of collapsing as do the lobes of the 
leaves of Dionsea, and in this way enclosing 



the captive insect, the Droseras appear rather 
to hold them by the viscid property of their 
dew-like secretion. When an insect settles on 
any part of the leaf, it finds itself gummed 
down as it were by contact with this secreted 
fluid, and unless it be large and powerful, its 
struggles to escape serve but to fix it the more 
firmly, from bringing in into contact with a 
greater amount of the viscid matter, until at 
length, it becomes so surrounded by the curved 
hairs, which are fastened to its body by the 
sticky fluid, that its escape is entirely pre- 
vented, and it is accordingly held in that po- 
sition till it perishes. Withering, however, re- 
lated some instances in which the leaves had 
been observed to collapse or fold up, and thus 
enclose the insects. 

Another property possessed by these plants 
is that of staining paper. In fact, some exotic 
species it is believed might be turned to ac- 
count in this way. All our wild species have 
this property ; but it is less powerful in D. 
rotundifolia than in D. longifolia, and D. 
anglica. Specimens collected for herbariums, 
after having been dried, still possess the same 
property, even to the extent of penetrating 
several contiguous sheets of the paper among 
which they are laid. Sir W. Hooker observes, 
that with him D. rotundifolia, and D. anglica 
retained this property for a number of years, so 
that the form of the leaves, scapes and flowers 
is distinctly represented through to the back 
of the sheets on which they are fastened, and 
also upon the backs of others which may at 
any time have been lain above them ; and 
this, though the specimens are perfectly dry. 

Respecting the special properties of par- 
ticular exotic species, we find a record of the 
following : — D. communis of Brazil is said by 
Augustede St. Hilaire to be poisonous to sheep. 
D. lunata has viscid leaves with glandular 
fringes, which close upon flies and other insects 
that happen to alight upon them ; it is pro- 
bable it would yield a valuable dye. It is also 
believed that some of the Swan River species 
of Drosera might be turned to account in that 
way, for every part of D. gigantea stains paper 
of a brilliant deep purple, and when fragments 
are treated with ammonia they yield a clear 
yellow. The bulbs of D. erythrorhiza and 
D. stolonifera have similar dyeing qualities. 

The most convenient mode of cultivating 
them is to plant them in wide shallow pots, 
about three parts filled up with broken pot- 
sherds, and rough peat soil, on which a layer 
of living sphagnum moss is to be planted, and 
the Droseras planted among the sphagnum ; the 
pots should be kept standing in pans or feeders of 
water. They may be kept in a frame, which 
should occupy a shady cool situation. In 
winter the plants may be slightly covered over 
during severe weather with a layer of loose

litter ; they do not require glass sashes ; and 
during the remainder of the year they may be 
exposed to the free atmosphere, except during 
the summer, -when during the middle of hot 
days they are the better for being shaded for 
a few hours. They will very seldom require 
re-potting, but occasionally a little fresh sphag- 
num may be put about them ; or if at any 
time it should get displaced by any means, it 
should immediately be renewed. The pots 
ought constantly to stand in pans of water, and 
at least during eight months, including the 
summer half-year, the pans of water into 
which these pots are set should be deep enough 
for the water to reach two-thirds up the sides 
of the pots. They increase by seeds, which 
sow themselves ; but the commoner of the 
British species may be obtained wild in almost 
any quantity witli but little trouble. 

The few exotic species which have been i 
introduced may be grown in precisely a similar 
mannex*. the Xorth American species being 
placed with the British ones in the frame, and 
the Cape and New Holland species set under 
a hand-light, in a shady part of the green- 
house. 

THE DISGUISING OF FLOWERS. 

Theee is a certain set of florists who 
inherit from the old professors a degree of 
ingenuity which we should be glad to see 
banished altogether from the science. It was 
at one time considered a clever feat to cheat a 
judge, and no sooner was an award made 
known, than a man who had done something 
clever in the way of fraud would boast of it, 
and taunt his competing friends with their 
want of judgment for not detecting the trick. 
As long ago as we can remember, a man made 
himself famous for glueing the centre petals of 
the ranunculus together so as not to expose 
the seed vessel ; and there were not wanting 
those who followed the example on other 
flowers. The dexterity of some in dressing 
flowers gives them a decided advantage over 
such as know nothing about it, but it is diffi- 
cult to draw the line between fair dressing 
and distortion, between legitimately placing 
the beauties of a flower in the best position, 
and altogether changing the features. Like 
all other evils that are permitted to grow, the 
dressing of flowers is occasionally carried to 
extremes ; and this lias induced us to take up 
the subject in earnest. 

If the mutilation of a flower be permitted, 
great changes could be made for the better, 
even in a very bad one. If the application of 
artificial means to bloom a flower were 
objected to, there would be no stopping nny- 
where, for in truth three parts of the horti- 
cultural and floral skill mav be said to be 



expended in the application of such means. 
The very shading of a flower from the sun, or 
defending it from the rain, is to a degree the 
application of artificial means. 

There is no better test, then, to be applied, 
than the condition of a flower when shown. 
If one man could show a carnation without 
dressing, and another man mauled it about a 
good deal, the application of a glass to that 
flower which had received no dressing would 
show a beautiful enamel, or velvet surface of 
the most beautiful texture, while the bloom 
that had been pulled about and disturbed a 
good deal would show bruizes all over the 
surface, where the dresser had squeezed the 
petals and the texture of the surface. TVe 
have frequently seen fine stands of well-grown 
carnations and picotees, all laid very mechani- 
cally, but as dull as so many rags, while others 
that have hardly been touched were less 
formal, but brighter and better in all respects. 
Pinks are much of the same nature, and un- 
dergo, under some hands, much the same 
torture. But this family of subjects require 
dressing, and those who can dress best with 
the least handling, will assuredly exhibit best. 
The laws of dressing, as originally laid down 
and acted upon, were, that you may take as 
much as you like away, but must add nothing; 
and this latter restriction became very neces- 
sary when there were persons ingenious 
enough to remove faulty petals and replace 
them with fine ones from another flower. It 
must however be taken into consideration that 
if flowers are damaged materially by dressing, 
they tell greatly against the claims they 
might otherwise possess from their superior 
growth. 

There are flowers which not only do not 
require dressing, but which in the eyes of a 
good judge would be altogether condemned for 
it. We have seen pansies ridiculously spoiled 
by the attempt to give them a property which 
they did not possess ; for instance, flatness. 
The flowers have naturally been crumpled or 
puckered, and there has been an attempt to 
press them flat. TTe have seen the boxes of 
pansies brought to exhibitions with flat pieces 
of glass laid on them, and the glass loaded 
with weights of some kind ; in some cases a 
few pennyworth of halfpence, in other cases, 
stones ; but, although this continued pressure 
flattened the flower, it only laid the puckers 
into doubles or plaits, and exhibited all the 
deformities which told against the flower 
more offensively than if they had been per- 
mitted to show all the original defects. 

The dahlia is a flower so rapidly increased, 
so high in price while new, and so eagerly 
sought by amateurs, that any thing like a 
disguise in them was a serious evil. In an 
early day it was a common practice to cut out 



DISGUISING OF FLOWERS. 



271 



the centres of those flowers which did not close 
up well, so that as the petals towards the 
centre were developed, they filled up the 
vacancy artificially made ; whereas, had that 
part not been cut out, the hard scaly centre 
would have kept the opening petals from 
closing in. This was detected, and we may 
say punished, in early days ; for flowers were 
shown as seedlings, that nobody could grow in 
the same state again, one of the fatal blemishes 
being a hard unbloomed, or a seedy, eye ; and 
to use any contrivance by which a flower of 
this description could be shown at all perfect, 
was to make a flower not worth a sixpence, 
look worth half-a-guinea : the practice was 
repudiated, and if it be done now at all, it is a 
very rare occurrence ; but there is another 
species of disguise which is quite as bad, al- 
though not yet so entirely exposed as to make 
it a fatal transaction. One of the worst faults 
of a dahlia is that of quilling too much, as it is 
called, which is, that the petals not unrolling 
themselves enough to develope the proper form 
of flowers, they are like so many pipes, and 
show only the outside surface. The kind of 
dressing to which we have now such an utter 
objection, is effected by means of a tapering 
piece of ivory, bone, tortoise-shell, or wood, 
which is thrust into the half-bloomed petals, 
and by degrees forced into them sufficiently to 
open the outer ends of the petal. This is done 
slowly, and by degrees ; perhaps the dresser 
is thrust in a dozen times, and a little gentle 
violence used every time this is done, to open 
a reluctant petal. In a general way, the man 
who prides himself upon his dressing, thrusts 
the dresser into every petal ; even the outside 
ones that are most open can be made more 
regular in an irregular flower than they will 
come of themselves. It is a prevailing fault 
with those flowers which have cupped petals, 
that those towards the centre do not open freely, 
and nothing looks worse than to see the backs 
of the petals turned over in front. The only 
question then is this, is it right or proper that 
a man, whose time is comparatively valueless, 
or whose pursuits will enable him to spend the 
time, should, by means of coaxing, and twist- 
ing, and pressing this petal one way, and that 
petal another, so alter the appearance of a 
flower, as to induce people to buy it when it is 
not worth the room it occupies ? Now, last 
summer there were several flowers which 
were exhibited, very pretty as seedlings, and 
passed as fairish, indeed, as very nice flowers, 
among many amateurs, that when they were 
grown, were not even the same form. Miss 
Prettiman was a very taking variety, and 
would have sold by hundreds, but that a cer- 
tain writer who is looked up to, condemned it 
by faint praise. He admitted it was " a beau- 
tiful tipped flower, but showed the backs of 



the petals ;" and said it was " not a compact 
double flower, but fills up ;" as much as to say, 
the flower looks pretty, but cannot do to show; 
but there were those present who thought it 
very beautiful as a show flower. Where is it 
now ? who grows it ? who is there that would 
not sell the dry root for sixpence if he could 
find a customer ? There was a Mrs. Caudle, 
and Magician, much the same ; shown pretty 
well opened, but in the hands of the public not 
worth a turnip paring ; and, unless the dress- 
ing of these things is looked after by judges, 
and some penalty inflicted by rejecting them, 
we shall be always subject to this kind of im- 
position. In short, there is constant evidence 
that, unless the degree of manufacturing a 
flower has undergone be taken into considera- 
tion, at the same time as the appearance of it, the 
flower trade will be as fraudulent as ever, for 
it is lamentable to contemplate, that the very 
worst and most worthless things have been 
sent out by the best judges. 

Let us therefore impress upon the minds of 
judges for the present season, the necessity 
there is to examine very closely the state of the 
flowers presented to them for their decision ; 
to observe narrowly the general character ; 
and to satisfy themselves that no artificial 
means have been applied to give them the ap- 
pearance of being better than they are. There 
are circumstances which ought especially to 
awaken their suspicion ; such for instance as 
meeting with a flower of a particular variety 
better grown, or in better condition than they 
usually see it, or a flower that they do not know 
among a general collection : both of these cir- 
cumstances are suspicious, and require strict 
investigation. If a variety which usually has 
a particular fault is shown without it, there is 
a good reason for close examination. The 
other day a pansy, which usually has the 
under petal too long and indented, was ob- 
served in excellent condition and form ; on 
taking a strong magnifier to it, we found the 
lower petal had been clipped, by which the 
fault was entirely removed. Last season a 
dahlia was shown whose disposition was to 
quill so much as to be hardly showable ; but 
it was shown in a very pretty foi'm, and hardly 
quilled at all ; this had been poked about in 
every petal to force them open, and on taking 
a glass to it, it was seen that many of the 
petals had been split in the operation. Many 
other things equally absurd, but, nevertheless, 
equally fraudulent, call for the especial atten- 
tion of judges ; and as exhibitors who depend 
on these artificial means for their success are 
sure to object to judges who can and will 
detect and disqualify them, we should like to 
see every judge act upon the same principles, 
by which the over cunning people would be 
detected.

THE RHUS, OR SUMACH. 



THE RHUS, OR SUMACH. 

The generic name Ebus, by which, this 
family of plants is known, owes its derivation 
to the Greek rhoos, or rhous, which comes from 
the Celtic rhudd, or red, apparently in refe- 
rence to the colour of the fruit and leaves of some 
of the species in the autumn. Sumach comes 
from Simaq, the Arabic name of the plant. 
Rhus belongs to the natural order Anacardia- 
ceae, and both to the Linnasan Pentandria 
Trigynia, and Dioecia Pentandria. It consists 
of deciduous small trees, shrubs, and climbing 
plants. There are a great number of species, 
of which those noticed are the most interesting. 

Rhus Amela (Amela Sumach) is a Nepal 
deciduous shrub, growing four feet in height. 

Rhus aromatica (aromatic Sumach) is a 
deciduous shrub, attaining the height of six 
feet; the leaves consist of three rhomboid- 
ovate leaflets; the flowers are small, yellow, 
in dense terminal spikes. It is a native of 
several parts of North America. 

Rhus copaUina (Gum Copal Sumach) has 
large pinnated leaves of from five to seven 
pairs of lanceolate entire leaflets, which are 
used as tobacco by the Indians of the Missouri 
and Mississippi. It forms a deciduous shrub, 
with stolon iferous, or creeping roots, and 
grows four or five feet high, bearing its yellow- 
green flowers in August. A variety called 
leucantha, has whitish flowers, and its roots 
are not stoloniferous. 

Rhus Coriaria (hide-tanning Sumach) 
has pinnate leaves, of five or seven pairs of 
elliptical, toothed leaflets ; the flowers are 
whitish green, in loose terminal panicles, and 
appear in July. It forms a small deciduous 
tree, of eight or ten feet in height, and is 
found in sunny rocky spots in the south of 
Europe. The seeds are used at Aleppo to 
provoke appetite, as those of mustard are in 
England. 

Rhus Cotinus (Venetian Sumach) is a 
very desirable shrub, with obovate, entire, 
stiff, lucid leaves, which remain on till killed 
•by frost, and render the plant almost sub- 
evergreen. It usually grows from six to eight 
feet high, and is exceedingly ornamental when 
covered with large loose panicles of elongated 
hairy pedicels of a reddish green tinge, which 
are produced at the end of nearly every shoot, 
forming a thready interwoven mass, often as 
much as six inches through ; very few of 
these, which are properly flower stalks, pro- 
duce any flowers ; the flowers become abortive, 
and the pedicels, after the flowering time, 
lengthen and become hairy ; the flowers are 
small, and of a pale purple or flesh colour. 
It inhabits the south of Europe, and Asia. 
The whole plant is used for tanning, and for 
dyeing wool, silk and leather of a yellow 



colour. About Venice it is used for dyeing 
black. Sometimes this plant attains a much 
larger size than has been named ; a plant at 
Enville, in Staffordshire, several years ago, 
was upwards of forty feet in diameter. 

Mhus glabra (glabrous, or Scarlet Sumach) 
is a deciduous shrub of nine or ten feet high, 
with pinnate leaves, of from eight to ten pairs 
of lanceolate glabrous leaflets ; the flowers are 
greenish yellow. It is common in the woods 
throughout the greater part of North America. 
One variety of this, called coccinea, (or elegans 
by some,) has red flowers. The branches of 
R. glabra, boiled with the berries, afford an 
ink-like tincture. R. viridiflora is nearly 
allied to this. 

Rhus pentaphylla (five-leafleted Sumach) 
is a deciduous shrub, growing to the height of 
ten feet ; the leaves are pinnate, with three to 
five linear-lanceolate, and entire leaflets. The 
fruit is acidulous, and edible; and the bark 
dyes red, and is used in tanning leather. 

Rhus pumila (dwarf Sumach) grows only 
about a foot in height, with leaves of many 
pairs of oval leaflets, and bearing greenish 
flowers in July. It is very venomous. 

Rhus radicans (rooting branched Sumach 
or Poison Oak) is an exceeding poisonous 
plant, but which acts differently on different 
persons ; some dare not even approach it. It 
is a deciduous plant, with a low shrubby stem, 
rising two feet or more in height, and ex- 
tending twenty or thirty feet over the surface 
of the ground, rooting at the joints; the 
leaves consist of three large ovate, entire 
leaflets. It is found in many parts of North 
America, sometimes spreading on the ground; 
at other times climbing to the tops of the 
highest trees, its roots penetrating their bark. 
A pale brown sap, obtained from the stem, is 
of a disagreeable smell, and makes an indelible 
mark upon linen. There are two or three 
varieties : — vulgaris, volubilis, and micro- 
carpa, all of which are climbing plants. 

Rhus Toxicodendron (Poison tree Sumach) 
has leaves of three large, nearly oval leaflets. 
The plant approaches R. radicans so closely, 
that probably they are not distinct as species. 
It yields a yellow milky sap, which also forms 
an indelible ink for linen. It is a native of 
North America. There are one or two va- 
rieties of this. 

Rhus typhina (fever or stag's-horn Sumach) 
is a deciduous tree growing from twelve to 
fifteen feet or more high, with irregular 
crooked forked branches, covered with soft 
velvety down, resembling that of a young 
stag's horn, both in colour and texture. The 
leaves are large, pinnate, of from eight to ten 
pairs of lanceolate leaflets. It occurs in most 
parts of North America, in some parts of 
which the wood is used for tanning leather ; 



THE RHUS, OR SUMACH.

and the roots prescribed as a febrifugal medi- 
cine. There are three varieties : — arborescens, 
assuming the tree form, and growing from ten 
to twenty-five feet ; frutescens, of more shrub- 
by habit, generally between two feet and ten 
in height ; and viridijiora, which has green 
flowers. 

Rhus venenata (poisonous, or swamp Su- 
mach) is a deciduous shrub, or low tree, with 
pinnate, glabrous leaves, of five or six pairs 
of oval-lanceolate, entire leaflets. It is found 
in swamps in various parts of North America ; 
there it attains twenty feet in height, but in 
cultivation it has not reached that size. It is 
very poisonous, both when touched and 
smelled to. The milky juice stains linen. 
The leaves are very ornamental in the autumn, 
as they die off, of an intense red or purple 
colour. 

Rhus vernicif era (varnish yielding Sumach) 
is a small deciduous tree, with much the habit 
of the stag's-horn sumach, but having large 
leaves, the five or six pairs of leaflets forming 
which, are ovate and entire. It is a native of 
Japan and Nepal, and is of robust growth. 
Thunberg affirms that the best Japan varnish 
is procured from this species, which grows in 
abundance in many parts of that country, and 
is also cultivated for profit. The varnish, 
which oozes out of the tree on its being 
wounded, is procured from stems that are three 
years old, and is received into some proper 
vessel ; when first collected it is whitish, and 
of the consistence of cream, but on exposure 
to the air it thickens and becomes black. 
This varnish is very transparent, and hardens 
very much, but will not endure any blows, as 
it cracks almost like glass, though it will 
bear boiling water without injury. With this 
substance the natives of Japan varnish their 
door posts and window frames, their drawers, 
chests, boxes, scimitars, bows, teacups, soup 
dishes, portable stools, and, in fact, most of 
their articles of domestic furniture which are 
made of wood. 

None of the species of Rhus are adapted to 
produce any striking effect in masses ; indeed, 
the only two species which are worthy of 
being at all generally introduced are the 
R. Cotinus, and the R. typhina : the others 
are interesting merely where a collection of 
different kinds of trees is attempted, or where 
they may happen to be required for any special 
purpose. R. Cotinus, or the Venetian Su- 
mach, is a very ornamental shrub, both in 
its habit of growth, and when adorned with 
its hair-like masses of flower stalks ; and it 
may be introduced with advantage and effect 
in shrubberies near the front, where it may be 
within the range of the eye. When planted 
out singly on the lawn, it is also a very beauti- 
ful object, forming a dense mass, and extend- 
ing, as it increases in age, to a goodly size and 
48 



proportion. R. typliina (the stag's-horn 
Sumach) on the other hand is interesting from 
its singularity, both in the summer, when its 
large pinnated leaves are in all their freshness 
and vigour ; in autumn, when they are chang- 
ing to a warmer tint ; and in the winter, when 
entirely destitute of these appendages, and 
exhibiting only its few large crooked stag's- 
horn-like branches. It may be planted either 
singly on the lawn, where it will be found to 
be a very interesting looking object, or it may 
be sparingly introduced in low shrubberies, 
where its stem would be hidden by the sur- 
rounding foliage, and its branches alone would 
appear above the tops of the shrubs. All or 
any of the other species, being suitable only to 
form part of a collection illustrating the nature 
and habits of trees and shrubs generally, may 
be planted out singly in the space set apart 
for that purpose. In any such collections 
formed for that particular object, the plants 
ought by no means to be dotted evenly over 
the surface of the ground devoted to them ; 
but each particular family of larger or smaller 
extent, should be grouped together (not 
crowded) so as to afford opportunities both 
for studying and observing their particular 
forms, and also for the sake of affording faci- 
lity for botanical investigation, if that should 
happen to be the gist of the proprietor. If 
this rule is observed, and a considerable space 
can be afforded between the particular groups, 
a considerable amount of pictorial effect may 
be produced, where otherwise the idea of an 
apple orchard would only be suggested. It is 
by no means essential, however, that each 
particular family of plants should be alto- 
gether isolated ; while the members of one 
family or genus of plants are kept in conti- 
guity with each other, several of these groups 
forming a " natural order," or even several 
smaller orders, having special affinity, may 
with strict propriety be congregated together 
into a larger group ; and even the groups them- 
selves, which form a particular main subdi- 
vision of the whole vegetable kingdom, may 
be so far connected as to show at once the 
degree of relationship which exists generally 
between them. 

All the species of Rhus will grow in or- 
dinary garden soil, though for the most part 
they prefer a dry loamy soil, or at least one 
in which there is no superabundance of mois- 
ture. Rhus venenata is an exception to this 
rule ; it naturally inhabits swampy ground, 
and probably requires a similar situation to 
attain its full perfection ; it does not usually 
grow in English gardens to the perfection in 
which it is naturally found, which is pro- 
bably owing to this circumstance. The shrub- 
by kinds may be increased by layering, some 
of them from suckers, and all the others from 
seeds.

An Abstract of Reports, Papers, and 
Proceedings of the Horticultural 
Society of London, with Notes by a 
Practical Gardener. 
The Advantage of Saddle grafting. — 
In pointing out the advantage of saddle graft- 
ing, which is not new, hut which, I believe, 
.has rarely been properly executed, it will be 
necessary that I describe the motion of the 
sap, as I conceive it to be, at the period when 
grafts are most advantageously inserted. The 
graft first begins its efforts to unite itself to 
the stock j ust at the period when the formation 
of a new internal layer of bark commences in 
the spring; and the fluid, which generates 
this layer of bark, and which also feeds the 
inserted graft, radiates in every direction from 
the vicinity of the medulla [pith] to the ex- 
ternal surface of the alburnum [sap wood]. 
The graft is of course most advantageously 
placed when it presents the largest surface to 
receive such fluid, and when the fluid itself is 
made to deviate least from its natural course. 
This takes place most efficiently when a graft 
of nearly equal size with the stock is divided 
at its base and made to stand astride the stock, 
and when the two divisions of the graft are 
pared extremely thin, at and near their lower 
extremities, so that they may be brought into 
close contact with the stock (from which but 
little bark or wood should be pared off) by 
the ligature. I have adopted this mode chiefly 
in grafting cherry trees, and I have rarely 
ever seen a graft fail, even where the wood 
has been so succulent and immature as to pre- 
clude every hope of success by any other 
mode. — From a Letter by T. A. Knight, 
Esq. 

Reverse grafting Pear Trees. — The 
following is the substance of a letter from 
Mr. "W. Balfour, gardener at Howick, to the 
Horticultural Society, as published in their 
Transactions : — This mode of grafting is in- 
tended for trained trees. The stock is trained 
according to the usual form of horizontal 
training ; that is, with an upright stem, and 
simple horizontal branches right and left at 
regular distances, and trained parallel to each 
other. The reverse grafting consists in graft- 
ing on to these horizontal branches on the 
lower side, and in a reverse way, that is, with 
the shoots pointing at an angle of about 45 
degrees towards the principal stem. These 
grafts furnish the bearing wood. The scions 
for this method are inserted in the same 
manner as in rind grafting, and by cutting off 
the greater part of the spurs of the branch 
intended to be grafted, the scions take readily, 
and shoot freely. The branches which are 
grafted must be wide enough apart to allow 
room for the growth of the grafts ; and if they 
are too close together for this, every alternate 



or third one must be grafted and the others 
removed. The grafts may be of the same 
kind as the stock, or different kinds ; they 
may be all of one kind or various. The usual 
defect observed in horizontally trained trees, 
viz. barrenness to some distance on either side 
of the main stem, while the extremities of the 
branches are fruitful, was the principal cause 
which led to the idea of reverse grafting. It 
promises to remedy this, and it also affords 
the advantage of growing a number of kinds 
of pear upon the same space of wall, for any 
desired kinds may be put upon the same tree. 
A full grown pear tree, bearing a moderate 
crop, in many kinds yields more fruit than 
sufficient to supply the dessert for a family, 
while the kind is in season ; hence the ad- 
vantage of growing more than one sort on a 
tree. The succession of pears is rendered 
more complete, where the same sort is worked 
on branches in different aspects. 

The use of Charcoal Dust. — The gar- 
den I superintend is a very wet, stiff soil, 
upon a strong clay, and without any declivity. 
For several years my crops of onions were 
nearly all destroyed by a grub, and by mouldi- 
ness coming on about their roots, at various 
stages of their growth ; sometimes when they 
were about the size of what we call scallions, 
at other times when they were beginning to 
form a bulb, and even when the bulb was 
formed. I also tried several experiments to 
prevent the disease taking place, but none 
had the desired effect, until I made use of 
charcoal dust, (which is the refuse that is left 
at the bottom of a charcoal pit after the char- 
coal for use is taken out,) spread upon the top 
of the ground, about half an inch thick, before 
the seed is sown, (the ground being previously 
well dug and manured,) and merely scuffled 
in with the point of a spade, so as to mix the 
top soil and charcoal dust together. This 
secured excellent crops of onions, with not 
the least appearance of any infection. My 
first experiment was upon a bed fifty feefi 
long, and five feet wide, prepared in the 
usual way ; one half the bed was dressed with 
charcoal dust, the other half without it ; the 
part on which the dust was laid had an excel- 
lent crop of onions, it remained quite clean 
and free from any disease, whilst the part to 
which the dust was not applied, was entirely 
destroyed by the grub and by mouldiness. 
The next year I determined to try the effects 
of the dust upon a larger scale; I therefore 
had the whole of the quarter prepared for 
onions, and divided it into eight beds of the 
same size as before ; four of the beds were 
treated with dust, the other four remained 
without it. The result was the same as before ; 
the beds where the dust was applied bore 
a good clean crop, whilst the others were

affected. The charcoal dust ought to be kept 
quite dry. I have also found that the appli- 
cation of charcoal dust effectually prevents 
the clubbing in the roots of cabbages, &c. 
I had been accustomed to use lime fresh from 
the kiln for that purpose, and always with 
considerable advantage; but since I have 
made use of the charcoal dust upon different 
quarters of the garden, and any of the Bras- 
sica tribe has been subsequently planted there, 
the clubbing has entirely disappeared. I once 
planted a quarter with cauliflower plants, 
which never arrived at maturity, being very 
much injured with the club. The following 
summer I had the same quarter prepared for 
onions, with charcoal dust upon it ; as soon 
as the onions were cleared off in October, 
I had it well dug over, and planted it imme- 
diately with early cabbages, which all arrived 
at maturity early, without the least appear- 
ance of clubbing. — Letter by Mr. T. Smith. 

[Charcoal is a very powerful agent in 
horticulture. Of its efficiency in striking 
cuttings, there can be no doubt; and as an 
absorbent, it has been found of the greatest 
use, even in preserving potatoes supposed to 
be affected by the disease. It is also of much 
utility in the cultivation of potted plants ; 
and the refuse of every kind incidental to a 
garden, when charred, forms a most valuable 
dressing for every kind of vegetable crop.] 

Covering the Naked Branches of 
Fruit Trees with New Wood. — It is a 
fact well known to horticulturalists, that the 
branches of fruit trees trained against walls 
and espaliers, after eight or ten years become 
naked for about a foot or two nearest the 
stem, which gives an unsightly appearance to 
the tree, especially when the branches are 
trained horizontally ; and it is in general diffi- 
cult to procure blossom spurs, or even wood 
shoots, in those situations, unless by training 
a new shoot from the main stem, which can- 
not always be procured. The idea struck 
me, that, if I interrupted the sap at a dis- 
tance from the main stem by ringing the 
branches, shoots might be produced between 
the ring and the stem. In spring, when 
the blossom buds were about to burst, I made 
a ring to the extent of one-fifth of an inch, 
in the usual way, at the distance of two feet 
from the main stem, round a branch of a 
Jargonelle pear tree, trained horizontally, 
which branch had for several years been 
entirely bare both of fruit spurs and wood 
shoots ; nor was there the smallest appear- 
ance of an embryo bud at the time of ringing. 
I soon found that a space to the extent of 
seven inches nearest the ring began to break 
into buds. The part of the branch nearest 
the stem, about seventeen inches, was without 
a bud ; I therefore concluded that six or eight 



inches should be substituted in future ring- 
ings instead of two feet. Another experi- 
ment has confirmed this opinion. About the 
same time I made that on the Jargonelle, 
I also ringed a branch of a Bergamot pear 
tree, at six inches from the stem, which 
produced me several prominent buds. The 
space which formed the ring is grown over in 
both branches. — Letter by Mr. Street. 

[The ringing of the bark to induce fruit 
bearing, has been a common though not 
always a successful practice ; but this opei - a- 
tion to produce young wood below it has not 
been so common. It will no doubt have the 
effect in some cases. Recourse to ringing 
fruit trees, either to produce wood or fruit, 
can however be only regarded as a barbarous 
evasion of a radical error in their manage- 
ment. Healthy trees, planted in proper soil 
and properly managed, will not require this 
speciesof mutilation toinducefruitfulness.] 

Peach Borders and Walls. — The peach 
borders should be carefully prepared, by form- 
ing them of a sweet fresh soil ; where the 
ground is not naturally such, the best pos- 
sible is the upper spit of an old upland 
pasture. The bottom should be drained, 
where requisite, to free it from stagnant mois- 
ture, and should be rendered impervious to 
the roots, especially if the subsoil be at all wet. 
The border should also, where that sacri- 
fice can be made, be left in possession of the 
peach-tree alone, and worked with forks only, 
to avoid injuring the roots ; but as devoting 
so valuable a portion of the garden as the 
south borders to no other purpose, may not in 
many cases be expedient, it would be advisa- 
ble to leave apertures at the bottom of the 
wall, through which the roots of the peach- 
tree may penetrate to the outside, and be 
there suffered to range unmolested. Brick 
walls are preferable to those formed of any 
other materials, as they are not only drier 
and possess a more equal temperature, but in 
consequence of their colour absorb and retain 
a greater portion of heat than most others. 
Copings proportioned to the height of the 
wall should always be laid on its top, as they 
not only protect the bloom, but keep the wall 
dry and warm, and so facilitate the ripening 
of the fruit and wood. Little or no manure 
should be given to the peach-tree while vigor- 
ous, or until weakened by age or bearing, and 
the object in pruning should not be to pro- 
duce strong luxuriant shoots, but such as may 
be kind and fertile, which, completing their 
growth early in the season, will be well 
ripened. Such course of treatment, steadily 
pursued, will rarely fail to render the peach- 
tree healthy and productive.

NOTES ON FLOWERS. 



native wild potato of South America (Sola- 
tium tuberosum) is found growing in con- 
siderable quantities in ravines in the imme- 
diate neighbourhood of Valparaiso, on the 
western side of South America, in lat. 34^° S. 
The leaves and flowers of the plant are similar 
in every respect to those cultivated in Eng- 
land, and elsewhere. It begins to flower in 
the month of October, the spring of that 
climate, and is not very prolific. The roots 
are small and of a bitterish taste, some with 
red and others with yellowish skins. Two 
tubers of these from Mr. Caldcleugh, who 
received them from South America, were 
exhibited to the Horticultural Society in 
1822. They were planted separately in small 
pots, and speedily vegetated ; they grew 
rapidly, and were subsequently turned out 
into a border at about two feet distance from 
each other, when they became very strong 
and luxuriant. The blossoms at first were 
but sparingly produced, but as the plants 
were earthed up they increased in vigour, and 
then bore flowers abundantly ; but these 
were not succeeded by fruit. ' The leaves, 
compared with specimens of several varieties 
of the cultivated potato, were generally rather 
of a more rugose and uneven surface above, 
with the veins stronger and more conspicuous 
below, but in other respects there was no dif- 
ference between them. 

The earth with which the plants had been j 
moulded up had been applied in considerable 
quantity, so as to form a ridge, the sides of 
which were full two feet high ; and about the j 
month of August runners from the roots and 
joints of the covered stems protruded them- 
selves towards the surface of the ridge in 
great numbers, and when they reached the 
light, formed considerable stems, bearing 
leaves and blossoms, so that at length the two 
plants became one mass of many apparently 
different plants issuing from all sides of the 
ridge. The appearance of these runners in 
such quantities induced a doubt as to the 
identity of the plant with our common potato, 
which doubt was increased when it was ascer- 
tained, that so late as the month of August 
no tubers had been formed by the roots ; but 
all doubt respecting them was afterwards 
removed ; they are unquestionably the So- 
larium tuberosum. The principal stems, w r hen 
extended, measured more than seven feet in 
length ; the produce was most abundant, 
above six hundred tubers were gathered from 
the two plants ; they were of various sizes, a 
few as large or larger than a pigeon's egg, 
others small, rather angular, but more globular 
than oblong ; some white, others marked with 
blotches of pale red or white. The flavour 
of them when boiled was exactly that of a 
young potato. 



The tubers lost all the bitterness of flavour 
which is attributed to them in the natural 
state, and their size increased remarkably ; 
from which circumstances I am disposed to 
infer, that the original cultivators of this vege- 
table did not exercise either much art or 
patience in the production of their garden 
potatoes. — Letter by J. Sabine, Esq. 

[The wild form of the potato plant is not 
unfrequently imported as a botanical curi- 
osity j it does not widely differ from some of 
our cultivated varieties. Both white and 
purple flowered kinds have been thus im- 
ported. It is, however, not very certain that 
all the varieties now cultivated have sprung 
from one original form.]

wild forms, he observes : " When we look at 
the species with single or semi-double flowers, 
which are the types of the present garden 
varieties, and compare them with those va- 
rieties, the contrast may well make us in- 
quire — Have the latter really descended from 
these species ? so greatly are they improved 
in form and texture of petal — increased also 
in size — changed from single to double — and 
varied in colour to a remarkable degree, that 
I do not wonder at persons unacquainted with 
the effects of cultivation on the wild species 
wishing to know the process of development 
before they accredit statements such as these. 
We may fairly presume, however, that such is 
their origin. But if so, how has such a change 
been wrought ? we reply, simply by a long 
course of careful and systematic culture. 
What was the rose comparatively speaking, 
fifty, or even thirty years since ? There are 
doubtless some admirers of the genus who 
can glance retrospectively to the former 
period, and trace the gradual alteration from 
flimsy semi-double varieties, few blooming in 
the autumn, to the full bold flowers of the 
present day, so exquisite in colour, so sym- 
metrical in form. In order to trace their 
descent, it is necessary to revert to the species 
which we must suppose existing in a wild 
state. We know little of cultivation as pur- 
sued in remote ages, but may be justified in 
presuming that seeds of the rose were sown, 
as well as those of other trees and plants. It 
is recorded that the Romans did this, but we 
now allude to times anterior to these. Now, 
supposing the seeds of the wild species to have 
been gathered and sown, Nature's stores thus 
opened, she would yield forth her treasures, 
here as elsewhere, in rich abundance ; the 
plants raised would produce flowers varying 
in colour, size, and degree of fulness. We 
may suppose the handsomest of these would 
be cherished most, and the probability is, that 
seeds would be saved from such ; hence we 
might expect to obtain a variety as before, 
and a further advance in beauty. So on from 
time to time, the improvement taking place 
so gradually as to fix the attention only of the 
curious in such matters. Ages might thus 
roll away, and the species be not marvellously 
changed from their primitive form. But 
following the stream of time, we reach the 
period when the raising of plants became a 
settled occupation ; soon men turned their 
attention to the improvement of races ; then 
the sexes of plants were generally acknow- 
ledged ; and finally, the effects of artificial 
fertilization were made known, and the art 
practised. The latter was indeed a grand 
stride in the path of improvement ; by its 
pursuance man stepped in to the aid of Nature, 
and the results are strikingly visible." 



The description of the varieties — each group 
of which is discussed separately — is given on 
a very complete and excellent plan, embracing 
not only the commonly observed points of 
colour, size, form, &c, but also such points as 
habit and rate of growth, considerations of 
great importance in the judicious and satis- 
factory arrangement of a rose garden. The 
historical portion of the work will form very 
interesting reading. — M. 

HUMEA ELEGANS. 

The Humea elegans is a very graceful 
plant when well cultivated. Its habit is erect, 
with a few very subordinate side branches, 
and it reaches from five to eight feet in height. 
The stem is clothed thickly with large lance- 
shaped downy leaves, which, under good treat- 
ment, should be preserved nearly down to the 
base of the stem, as much of the beauty of the 
plant depends on its being furnished with 
perfect foliage ; the foliage has an agreeable 
scent. The flowers are not individually con- 
spicuous ; they are small, and look not unlike 
brownish shining scales, but they are produced 
in a very large and most gracefully drooping 
plume-like panicle, from the top of the plant, 
and from the points of the side shoots. It is 
a biennial, belonging to the senecious division 
of composite plants (Compositas-Senecionideaa). 
The seeds of the humea should be sown in the 
month of Ap'ril or May, (they do not succeed 
well later,) in pots of light sandy soil, plunged 
in any pit or frame where there may be a 
gentle bottom heat ; this is necessary on ac- 
count of the seeds being oftentimes shy of 
germinating. After they have sprung up they 
are very liable to damp off if great care is not 
observed in watering. As soon as the plants 
are of sufficient strength to admit of it being 
done, they must be potted singly into small 
pots, using any sort of rich, light, vegetable 
earth or mould, with a good mixture of sand. 
They are then to be set in a pit or frame 
near to the glass, and if there be a gentle bot- 
tom heat so much the better. After a few 
days, abundance of air ought to be given them, 
otherwise they will be drawn up weak and 
spindly. As soon as they have filled the pots 
with roots, they must be re-potted in larger 
pots, using at this shifting much stronger soil 
in order to encourage the plants to grow sturdy 
during the summer months, so that they may 
rest awhile during the short dull days in 
winter. The kind of soil which suits the 
humea consists of equal parts of fresh fibry 
loam, and decomposed vegetable mould, with 
a sufficient quantity of sand to render the 
whole porous. They require at all times 
abundance of pot room and a liberal drainage 
of potsherds and small charcoal, which seems

to suit them admirably well. Pots of eighteen ; 
inches in diameter are not too large for the I 
full-grown plants. Plants thus treated the J 
one season, generally commence flowering in j 
June or July the following season, when they 
become a very graceful ornament in the 
greenhouse. They may also be planted out 
in any warm sheltered spot in the flower 
garden previous to their coming into flower, 
and will there produce a fine effect. 

PANSIES AND THEIR EAULTS. 

The prevailing fault with the pansy is 
the small portion of ground-colour — yellow 
or white — as compared with the size of the 
flower, and the consequent breaking through 
of the eye into the deep margin. It may be 
very convenient for dealers to uphold varieties 
so faulty, but the judges ought to look sharply 
after a fault which spoils the brilliancy. A 
fine eye is a great point in a variety, if other 
portions of the flower are in perfection ; but 
if there be not ground-colour enough to show 
it off to advantage, the eye had better be small 
than large, for it is a fatal blemish if the rays 
join the margin. It appears to us a strange 
fancy to select from a bed of seedlings varieties 
with striking faults, but the mischief arises 
out of the determination of certain dealers to 
send out some new ones every season, and 
they can do no more than take their best. 
There is no real blemish in a small centre, 
supposing the eye were small in proportion, 
and this shows at once the propriety of decid- 
ing that the mere quantity of ground-colour 
should form no part of the set properties ; it 
were far better to determine that the eye 
should never break through to the margin, 
for it is the disproportion of the eye to the 
white or yellow surrounding it, that creates 
the defect, and causes the entire centre to be 
a confused, ill-defined, ungainly feature. If 
the grower would but attend to the details of 
the properties, instead of just two or three 
main features, which they think alone essen- 
tial, they would show better taste. "We know 
there are persons who hold themselves very 
high as individual authorities, who like round, 
thick, and smooth petals, but who fancy other 
points mentioned in the properties of no con- 
sequence. It betrays great ignorance of effect, 
and an abuse of order and taste ; for if they 
would take the pains to place beside each other 
two moderately pretty flowers, one with the 
eye breaking through the margin, and one in 
which there is no such fault, they would see 
at once the importance of attending to those 
points which they considered of small conse- 
quence. If the eye is distinct, and there is a 
clear white or yellow beyond it all round, that 
is all that is required, for the size of the yel- 



low or white centre is determined more by the 
eye than by the margin ; that is to say, its 
size in proportion to the eye is more important 
than its size in proportion to the border or 
margin. It must be obvious that, where 
variety is required, any restriction as to the 
quantity of colour would be wrong. Upon 
the size and form of the yellow or white 
centre many of the variegations would naturally 
depend ; therefore it is only necessary to make 
some condition which shall be easier defined, 
and infallible as a test ; and this is done in the 
rule laid down, that the eye and its rays shall 
not break into the margin. The more this is 
attended to on the part of raisers the better, for 
it is a sad fault, and much too general among 
those we are obliged to admit in stands for 
want of better. There is another blemish, 
of which we have said so much that very few 
now venture to put forth a new flower that 
possesses it, — we mean the two colours on the 
ground, the two side petals a paler yellow 
than the bottom one, or, as in some flowers, 
the two side petals white ground and the 
bottom one yellow, or straw, or an undefined 
mixture of both. This is so serious a fault 
that it ought to banish them from every stand; 
or rather, it ought to disqualify a stand alto- 
gether, and put it out of competition. It is 
becoming rare among good fanciers, and will, 
we hope, soon be as unknown in competition 
as a foul-bottomed tulip or a run petal in a 
pink or carnation. 



WARDIAN CASES FOR AQUATICS. 

Oxe of the most beautiful and curious 
adaptations of the principle of the TVardian 
case, is that of growing small aquatic plants 
in bell glasses, so contrived as to exclude the 
external air. In this way a very elegant 
ornament for the window-sill or drawing-room 
table may be produced. In an ordinary War- 
dian case, the upper parts of the plants only 
— the stems, leaves, and flowers — are pre- 
sented to view, but the aquatic plants admit 
of a much more complete inspection ; the 
growth and development of the roots is pe- 
culiarly interesting and instructive, and this 
is readily observed when the plants are grow- 
ing in clear water contained in a clear glass 
vessel. 

The mode of constructing these TVardian 
cases is both neat and simple ; it is effected 
thus : — A piece of ornamental wood is 
" turned" into the shape of a v^ry dwarf 
pedestal, of a saucer-like or shallow cup-like 
form, into which the knob of an inverted glass 
dome is adjusted, so that it stands secure. 
The glass is then filled with water, and soma 
floating plants placed upon the surface ; 



2S4 



GROWING PINE APPLES WITHOUT POTS. 



pieces of thin copper or zinc, a quarter of an 
inch in breadth, are bent into the shape of the 
letter S, and hooked upon the edge of the in- 
verted glass ; then, a second glass just so much 
smaller than the first as to fit within its rim, 
is placed with its mouth downwards, its edge 
merely covered by the water ; it is of course 
sustained in this position by the S shaped 
pieces of copper. In this way aquatic plants 
may be grown on the table of a living room, 
the leaves being protected from the dry air by 
the upper bell-glass, made air tight by its 
edge dipping into the water. The water, as 
often as necessary, is withdrawn by a few 
inches of small lead pipe bent into the form of 
a syphon. These globes might of course he 
made of large size, and ornamental, and the 
water might be withdrawn by the use of a 
small tap ; while gold fish might be intro- 
duced into the glass amongst the roots of the 
plants. 

Any of the small growing aquatic plants 
will be suitable for these glasses. To those 
who would find amusement in examining the 
development of botanical curiosities, the dif- 
ferent species of Lemna might be recom- 
mended. Even the fresh water Algae, such as 
confervas, might be introduced. These might 
be placed in glasses of small size. The fol- 
lowing plants would require more space, but 
would also have more general interest : — 
Aponageton distachyon, white flowers ; Byblis 
liniflora, blue ; Oxrdis ?iatans, white ; Pistia 
Stratiotes, white ; Pontedera crassipes, blue ; 
Vallisneria spiralis, small greenish ; Alisma 
natans, white tinged with purple ; Hoftonia 
palustris, pale purplish ; Hydrocharis Morsus- 
rance, white ; Utrictdaria vulgaris. 

The chief recommendations of this simple 
contrivance, are its small cost, and facility of 
application. Any person could contrive to 
manufacture one such as is here described, 
and the whole cost would be but a few shillings. 



GROWING PINE APPLES WITHOUT POTS. 

The plan of growing pine-apples without 
pots, which has recently attracted much notice, 
under the name of the Hamiltonian system, 
was described many years ago, in the Gar- 
deners' Magazine, by Mr. Joseph Lang, kitchen 
gardener to the King of Bavaria. About the 
end of March he formed a pit, and the mould 
having reached a certain temperature, he 
placed such plants in it, from the pine stove, as 
already showed fruit, and were in vigorous 
growth. He then proceeds to say-—" Holes 
being made in the mould, which consists of two 
parts of rich black soil, and one part of turfy 
loam, with a little sheep'3 dung, the plants are 
turned out of the pots, without the ball being 
disturbed, placed in the holes, and the soil ( 



I made firm about them. "When the row is 
I planted (twenty-four plants contained under 
I one sash, forming six rows in the width of the 
pit), I place on the top of the soil, round the 
roots, some cow-dung, several years old, and 
therefore thoroughly rotten, and not too wet. 
The coldness of our climate renders it neces- 
sary, when the heat of the manure subsides, 
or when there is a deficiency of solar heat, to 
light fires in the stoves, and to keep up a heat 
of from sixty-three to sixty-eight degrees, 
Fahr. In summer I allow the plants from 99 
to 113 degrees, Fahr. of solar heat, and only, 
when the sun is too hot, a few hours' shade is 
given by fir branches, or reed mats placed on 
the sashes. In July, or the beginning of 
August, the plants are watered, when neces- 
sary, with cow's urine, diluted with one half 
water ; and subsequently, I only sprinkle them 
with fine river water. When the day has 
been very hot, in the height of summer, the 
plants are rather freely sprinkled, in the 
evening, before the sashes are covered up, 
with river water ; which producing a vapour 
during the night, is very beneficial to the fruit, 
and also gives the plant a clean look. "When 
the plants have done bearing, which is in 
August or September, I let them stand with- 
out doing anything to them, except shortening 
the leaves of the main stem where the fruit 
has been growing, for the purpose of procur- 
ing more air and light for the new shoots or 
suckers. I have frequently taken from thirty 
to forty suckers from one old stock. About 
April the suckers are thinned, the finest being 
left standing ; the others are put into pots, 
although never smaller than of the appearance 
of two or three years' growth. Then the 
ground is loosened (an operation which is 
rather difficult), and fresh cow or sheep's dung 
put round the plants. During the summer 
months they are watered and treated as before. 
If I find in autumn that the plants, after 
having done bearing, do not look so promising 
as might be wished, I transfer them carefully, 
with the ball, to a new bed, made like the 
former, except that it is advisable to put some 
sand round the plants ; and here I treat them 
as before. During the winter a heat is kept 
up of from forty- six to fifty degrees, Fahr. 
There is no fear of their suffering, even though 
the coverings cannot be opened for several 
days ; for the plants do not begin to grow till 
the month of February. The fruit-bearing 
plants may remain for three years in the same 
place ; and I have seen them, in several in- 
stances, producing from three to six fruit 
every year of that period, of from one to two 
pounds weight each. I call this the wild mode 
of pine culture, because one sees on the same 
plant fruits large and small, ripe, half ripe, 
green, and in blossom."

CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS, 

AND ORIGINAL NOTES, CONNECTED WITH HORTICULTURE 
AND NATURAL HISTORY. 

The Scale Insects. — One of the most 
troublesome classes of pests to the gardener is 
that formed by the numerous species of the 
scale insect, which comprise the scientific 
family of Coccus. These take their common 
name from their appearance — that of a broad, 
flat, shield-like scale, which so securely shelters 
them from almost every attack, that when once 
established, they are with difficulty removed ; 
and, even if they are dislodged, it is ten to one 
but some of their numerous progeny are left 
behind. One of the best means of clearing 
plants of these pests is to ply them with hot 
water. Water of the temperature of 140 
degrees will annihilate the scale, young ones 
and eggs included, and will not do material 
injury to the plants. To the bark of leafless 
plants it will do no injury, nor will it affect 
stout and hard leaves ; and if it becomes ne- 
cessary to apply it in the case of plants having 
more tender foliage, though it may damage 
these, the injury to the plants will be far less 
than that which would result from the con- 
tinued attacks of the insects. Thus by apply- 
ing the remedy at proper periods the scale may 
be cleared off without at all damaging the 
plants. All deciduous plants should be cleared 
while they are leafless — they will not be in- 
jured then. Evergreens with thick leathery 
leaves may be operated on at any time, except 
when they are pushing their young and tender 
shoots, and under these circumstances they 
will not be inj ured. Those evergreen plants 
whose mature leaves are of delicate structure 
must be done during their resting season ; in 
most cases the plant may be cut in, and per- 
haps little but the old bare stem left to cleanse j 
— these will offer no obstruction ; if this cannot 
be, as much care as possible should be used, 
and if a few leaves are damaged, why, they 
will soon be replaced by the younger growth. 
The water may in most cases be most readily 
applied by the syringe ; sometimes it may be 
desirable to use a sponge. The principal 
condition of its application is, that it must 
reach every part to which the insect can have 
access. 

Gooseberry Caterpillar. — Various means 
are employed to destroy these destructive crea- 
tures. One very good plan is this : — About 
the end of March remove the surface soil about 
the trees for a diameter of a yard or so, that is, 
immediately under the bushes. This is to be 
taken out full two inches, or say three inches, 
and replaced by some fresh maiden soil ; and 
then, when the leaves break out, a light cover- 
ing of quicklime and soot is spread on the new 
soil in case there should be any stragglers. 
The old soil so removed should be taken away 



and burnt, and may then be used as a dressing 
elsewhere. The efficacy of this plan as regards 
the larvae of the Phalcena grossularidta, or 
magpie moth, may be easily accounted for. 
The eggs are hatched in September, and the 
young larvae take shelter during winter in the 
soil about the plants. By removing this be- 
fore they become active, we are obviously re- 
moving the cause of the evil, and as they 
will not occur in fresh maiden soil, the trees, 
it may be expected, will be in a great measure 
free from attacks. So the chrysalids of the 
Tenthredo grassidaria? — or gooseberry saw-fly, 
which also devastates these trees — which are 
deposited in the soil in autumn, are likewise 
removed with the old soil, and thus their at- 
tacks are prevented. The remedy is a simple 
one compared with the injury inflicted by the 
insects when left unmolested ; and those who 
have to protect their trees may choose between 
this plan and that of hand-picking as soon as 
the larvae appear, or dusting and washing the 
trees with the various powders and lotions 
which are held to be efficacious. 

Wild Vegetables. — Many kinds of wild 
plants afford acceptable vegetables in the early 
spring. Among these may be mentioned the 
young shoots of the nettle (Urtica dioica), 
which form an excellent spinach-like vegetable, 
and are exceedingly wholesome ; the young 
top, when quite crisp and tender, is the part 
employed ; they are boiled in the usual way. 
Another of these wild vegetables consists of 
the tops of the young shoots of the hop ( Hu- 
mulus Lupulus) before the leaves are expanded. 
These are dressed and eaten like asparagus, 
which they in some measure resemble. They 
are very wholesome and good. The succulent 
runners or under-ground stems of the marsh 
Woundwort ( ' Stachys palustrisj are used in 
the same way, and have somewhat the flavour 
of asparagus. In damp cultivated fields it 
often becomes a troublesome weed from the 
number of these suckers which it produces. 
The young leaves of the common cruciferous 
plant ( Alliaria officinalis), which bears the 
trivial names of Jack by the Hedge or Sauce 
Alone, form, when boiled, an excellent substi- 
tute for spinach. They are said to be excel- 
lent when boiled with mutton, or with any 
kind of salt meat ; in a fresh state they have 
rather an unpleasant garlic-like scent. 

Kohl Rabi. — The bulbs, or bulgy stems, 
of the kohl rabi form a useful vegetable, and 
are very hardy. The bulbs, when about three 
or four inches in diameter, are in a proper 
state for use. They are cut into quarters and 
well boiled, and have a flavour " between the 
artichoke and parsnip." The tops of the green 
variety form a very good substitute for brocoli 
in the spring, when the latter is all destroyed 
by the winter.

Mexican Plnuses. — The following results 
have been observed in the garden of the Horti- 
cultural Society at Chiswick, during the winter 
of 1846-7 ; in reference to the hardiness of 
some of the species of Pinus introduced from 
Mexico, chiefly by the agency of Mr. Hart- 
weg : — Pinus tenuifolia under glass, where 
however the internal and external temperature 
only showed one degree of difference, has 
been to all appearance killed. Planted out 
on the lawn, on the south side of the large 
conservatory, the following species are appa- 
rently killed : — P. apulcensis. P. Jilifolia, 
P. Russelliana, and P. Hartivegii. The 
same effect was produced on Juniper us fiac- 
cida, and J. tetragona. This situation must, 
however, have been a very cold one, as the 
Juniperusflaccida has stood unhurt in another 
part of the garden ; Pinus Russelliana is 
uninjured where it has been growing for some 
years ; P. apulcensis has its leaves turned 
brown at the points ; and P. Hartivegii 
under similar circumstances proves rather more 
tender. Under all circumstances, Pinus jili- 
folia, and P. pseudo-Strobus, are killed. At 
Cork, the leaves of Pmuspatula were slightly 
browned ; and at the same place, Cupressus 
thurifera planted out about two years, is to 
all appearance dead. 

Cooking Jerusalem Artichokes. — The 
fullowing mode of cooking this vegetable, 
which has the general character of being 
watery and insipid, has been strongly recom- 
mended : — Boil the tubers so that the outside 
feels rather crisp when eaten ; then it is not 
watery, but has a delicious flavour : if, how- 
ever, it is boiled till it begins to break, it is 
watery and insipid. To cook them in this way, 
throw a handful of salt into the saucepan so 
as to make a strong brine : when it toils put 
in the artichokes, washed but not pared, and 
in eight or ten minutes they will be done. 
Then peel and serve up as may be preferred. 

TO PROPAGATE SCARCE AmARYLLIDS. 

The following plan may be adopted with suc- 
cess, when any scarce kinds are required to 
be propagated : and also in the case of such 
as do not readily produce offsets : — Cut off 
the bottom of the bulb, and lay it in the sun 
for an hour or two, in order to dry up the 
juices a little ; then select a pot a little larger 
than the bulb, fill it half full of compost 
suitable for the particular species, and the 
other half with damp silver sand, into which 
the cut bulb is to be gently pressed : place 
the pot on a shady shelf in the stove or green- 
house, and give the bulb just water enough 
to prevent its shrinking. A single bulb will 
thus sometimes yield an increase of twenty. 
Other bulbs of the same structure — that is, 
tunicated bulbs, like the onion — may be pro- 
pagated in the same way. 



Germination of Seeds. — The germina- 
tion or development of seeds, is said to be 
accelerated by steeping them in water, acidu- 
lated with oxalic acid in the proportion of 
sixteen drops to the pint, or one drop to the 
ounce by measure of water. This statement 
is made by Mr. Hamilton, in the Gardeners' 
Magazine. It is, however, recommended to 
wash off any adhering acid from the seeds so 
steeped. In the case of seeds having a hard 
bony covering, steeping in hot water greatly 
assists their germination, causing them to 
spring up very much earlier than otherwise 
they would do, and sometimes enables them 
to germinate when otherwise their feeble 
powers would prevent them from bursting 
their prison shell. The seed of many leguminous 
plants are among those which are greatly 
benefited by this practice. Soft coated seeds 
need nothing of the kind. The hard seeds to 
be operated on should be laid, each kind in a 
separate pan or vessel, and on the larger 
ones, boiling hot water enough to cover them 
is to be poured, and allowed to stand till it 
cools, and then the same process is to be re- 
peated. Smaller seeds must not have the 
water quite boiling, and one application will 
suffice. The seeds are afterwards sown in 
the usual way. 

Cropping Fruit Tree Borders. — There 
is a difference of opinion amongst gardeners 
as to the propriety of planting crops of culi- 
nary vegetables on the borders prepared for 
the roots of such of the choicer fruits as are 
planted against the garden walls. On the one 
hand it is contended, and probably rightly so, 
that this cropping is injurious to the trees — 
which, by the way, are reckoned to bring the 
most valuable of garden produce ; at any 
rate, the digging of the border for such crops 
either disturbs the roots of the trees, or com- 
pels them to extend themselves at a greater 
distance from the surface, which is an ad- 
mitted evil. On the other hand, it is mainly 
contended that the crops do not much affect 
the trees, and that the early produce which 
is raised in such situations, is too valuable to 
allow of a relinquishment of the plan. Again, 
on the other side, it is maintained that the 
constant cropping and manuring of the bor- 
ders for culinary crops has the effect, in a 
short time, of rendering the former healthy 
maiden soil much grosser and richer, by 
which means instead of moderate growth well 
matured, rank growth is excited, and this 
growth is not properly matured, and is con- 
sequently unfruitful. To avoid all this, the 
following plan has been suggested : — Pre- 
mising that the best means of inducing fruit- 
fulness, is to check over-luxuriance, and that 
this is best effected by using a healthy com- 
post from which stimulants are to a great

extent absent, it is recommended that fruit 
borders should be made in the first place the 
full width of fifteen feet, and that this fifteen 
feet should for the sake of elucidation be 
divided into three imaginary strips of five 
feet wide each, numbered 1, 2, and 3, be- 
ginning with that nearest the wall. Then 
No. 1, or that part where the trees are 
planted, must never be cropped, but kept 
occasionally forked up and pulverized ; Nos. 
2 and 3 are to be cropped at first ; but in 
the course of a few years, when it is seen that 
the soil is becoming altered, and the trees are 
too much stimulated, the soil of No. 2 is to 
be entirely removed, down to the bottom of 
the border, and replaced by fresh maiden soil ; 
No. 3 is to be trenched ; and the opportunity 
embraced of cutting back any large coarse 
roots that may have formed. In a few years, 
when the symptoms return, remove the soil 
from the space No. 3 entirely as before ; 
turn the soil of No. 2 over into No. 3, and 
fill up No. 2 again with fresh soil. Between 
the trees, spaces of No. 1, five feet or 
more in extent, may be taken out in the same 
way, and filled up again with fresh soil. In 
this way the advantages of root pruning are 
combined with securing the presence of healthy 
fresh soil for the roots to a very great extent ; 
while the ordinary cropping of the border is 
but little interfered with. 

Fuchsia corymbiflora. — This species may 
be grown so as to form very handsome standard 
plants ; and the following course of treatment 
is recommended for this end : — Sow the seeds 
at the end of February or beginning of March, 
and place them in a hot-bed. When the 
seedlings have grown two inches high, pot 
them singly into small three-inch pots, and 
plunge them in a gentle bottom heat. Repot 
them several times during their growth, so 
that tbey do not get pot-bound ; and finally 
put them into eleven or twelve-inch pots, 
using a rough open compost of two parts 
fibrous peat soil, two parts coarse mellow 
loam, one part lumps of charcoal, one part 
silver sand ; when finally potted, plunge them 
in a forcing pit to cause them to grow rapidly. 
All the lateral shoots must be removed until 
the desired height is attained ; they must then 
be topped to induce them to form a head : 
when the lateral shoots resulting from the 
stopping are a few inches long, they must be 
topped, to produce other shoots, so as to form 
a profusely branched standard. After this 
they must be removed to a warm greenhouse, 
or stove conservatory, where they will bloom 
luxuriantly for a long time, and assume quite 
a pendulous habit. By this treatment, they 
become fine blooming plants by August, from 
seeds sown in February. They make fine 
standards the second year, if the branches 



forming the head are shortened back to an eye 
or two after the first year's growth, and the 
plants are provided with fresh compost, and 
grown in a warm greenhouse, without bottom 
heat. 

Scarlet Pelargoniums for winter 
flowering. — Some of the dwarf free flower- 
ing scarlet pelargoniums, such as the Huntsman, 
General Tom Thumb, &c, form objects of 
great beauty for ornamenting the greenhouse 
or conservatory during winter. Good plants 
for this purpose may be had by taking off 
cuttings in March or the beginning of April, 
or selecting at that time some of the best 
dwarf plants rooted in autumn, and kept 
through the winter in store pots. In either 
case, get them potted as soon as possible in 
three-inch pots, in rich loamy soil. When 
they are well rooted in these pots, shift them 
into eight-inch pots, in similar compost, well 
drained : then plunge the pots in an open 
place, either in the soil, or in beds of coal- 
ashes, which are preferable. During summer, 
give the pots an occasional turn to prevent the 
roots from getting fixed and strong outside the 
pots, and top the shoots to produce bushy 
plants ; this latter must be done frequently at 
the early part of the season, but less fre- 
quently towards the end of summer ; the bloom 
buds, however, are to be constantly removed 
if they appear, until about the end of August 
or beginning of September. In October, 
before they are injured by frost, they must be 
taken up, the pots washed and cleaned, and 
the plants then removed to the greenhouse or 
conservatory : they will then be more or less 
in bloom, and a supply of flowers will come 
on in rotation. 

Trop^eolums, mixed. — Some account has 
recently been given of an accidental mixture 
of two kinds of tropasolum in one pot. This 
mixture consisted of T. brachyceras, and T. 
tricolor, which were growing and producing 
these blossoms intermingled. The writer 
adds: — "I could not help entertaining the 
idea, that if a combination of colours in the 
flower garden is so pleasing to the eye, there 
would be much wisdom in obtaining this plea- 
sure from plants in pots. A fine specimen of 
a tropasolum, combining the rich colour of 
Troyxzolum tricolor, with the yellow of T. 
brachyceras, and the soft coelestial blue of T. 
coeruleum, would have a very pleasing effect." 
This hint is worth bearing in mind. 

Epig^ea repens. — This beautiful little 
plant, the May-flower of the Nova Scotians, 
is generally found to be difficult of cultivation. 
This arises, in most cases, from ignorance or 
forgetfulness of its habits. The secret of 
cultivating it successfully consists in keeping 
within the range of its roots a constant supply 
of water, for it is a swamp plant. Potted in

rough, peaty soil, and placed in a cool situa- 
tion, where it can be kept constantly and 
moderately moistened, they will grow and 
flower profusely, with the shelter of a frame 
in winter. The flowers of this plant are 
Avhite, tinted with rose — one variety bright 
pink— and deliciously scented ; in shape they 
are like inverted pitchers. 

Turfing Fruit Tree Borders. — This 
plan is recommended by some — where the 
cropping of the borders can be dispensed with 
— as a substitute for mulching, or at least as 
securing all the advantages of mulching, the 
turf in addition giving the borders a neat 
and agreeable appearance, and the roots of the 
grass keeping the soil in the state of porous- 
ness and texture which is suitable for the 
roots of the trees. The arguments by which 
this plan is chiefly recommended, are these : — 
" look at our hardy trees growing in meadows, 
and consider the fruitfulness of our orchards, 
where the roots are never disturbed at all." 
It has been suggested, instead of allowing 
the border to remain entirely open as a grass 
plat, to introduce low trees — of the finer kinds 
of pears for example — along the border, at a 
proper distance from the wall, in which situ- 
ation they would derive benefit from the 
reflected heat and shelter of the wall. The 
dwarf standard pendulous trained pear trees 
would be very suitable for such situations, and 
would also have a very ornamental effect, if 
kept neatly trained. This plan is, of course, 
only practicable where the borders are not 
required to be cropped ; and in that case, we 
consider it to be the best means of disposing 
of the surface of the borders, not only as 
regards appearance, but also the well-being of 
the trees. Besides, an advantageous situation 
is gained for the other trees. 

Lycopodiums. — Tiie cultivation of lycopo- 
diums is by no means difficult. The hardy 
kinds succeed perfectly when planted out in 
moist peaty soil. A piece of flat rock work, 
constructed in a damp situation, and so that 
the spaces for the plants may be made to re- 
semble a morass, would no doubt be found to 
be more than any other situation adapted to 
these. The tender kinds grown in pots, suc- 
ceed well in turfy peat soil, and are best set 
into pans or feeders of water. They however 
grow freely when suspended in baskets, and 
also suspended, with their roots merely en- 
veloped with damp moss. In short, wher- 
ever moisture is abundant, and there exists a 
sufficiently elevated temperature to meet the 
wants of the several species, there need be no 
apprehension cf their success. Some of the 
slender trailing kinds may be very aptly ap- 
plied to cover the baskets, pots, and other con- 
trivances in which Orchidaceous plants are sus- 
pended ; and the more liardv of these trailing 



species form interesting objects, as edgings to 
vases, in which ornamental plants are set. Lyco- 
podium denticulatum, a species of this habit 
is well suited for a greenhouse temperature ; 
L. cesium is perhaps the most handsome of 
any, from its blue-green hue ; L. stoloniferum 
is stronger growing ; and some of the smaller 
kinds, as L. apodum, L. cordifoUum, L. bra- 
siliensis, &c. are well suited for planting 
among orchids. — M. 

Red Spider. — The red spider is often found 
very troublesome in frames. To destroy them, 
it is a good plan to wash the frames — round 
the front especially — with some clay mixed up 
with soapsuds to a paint, adding a handful of 
sulphur to a gallon of the mixture. A com- 
mon painter's brush will apply it. If the 
frame smells very strongly during hot sun- 
shine, air should be speedily given ; for in 
extremes, it may possibly cause damage to 
the plants. 

Dwarf Dahlias. — What a pity it is that 
those who make it their business to raise new 
varieties of these favourite autumnal flowers, 
do not avail themselves of the most desirable 
properties of that kind known in gardens as 
Dahlia glabrata — the D. Merkii of Leh- 
mann. Cross impregnation with this dwarf 
species could hardly fail to give rise to a class 
of varieties both dwarfer and smaller in their 
structure than those we now possess, and 
such varieties would be specially desirable in 
flower gardens, even if they were no boon to 
the florist. Probably the cross would tend to 
decrease the size of the blossoms a little, and 
if so, florists would not think it worth their 
while to encourage such a race. Under these 
circumstances, gardeners should attend to it 
for themselves. D. glabrata grows about 
two feet high, and is altogether of lighter 
and more elegant habit than the varieties 
of D. variabilis. A race of varieties em- 
bracing these characters would be very 
desirable. — M. 

The Daisy. — How few persons even know 
the variety which distinguishes this humble 
class of flowers. Their cheapness is some- 
what against them, it is true ; but if any gar- 
dener would take the trouble to get all the 
leading varieties, and plant them about in 
patches in the common borders, they would be 
found objects of much greater interest than 
many give them credit for. The flowers 
come out among the earliest of the spring, 
and the colours, which vary from pure white 
to very deep crimson, render a border, planted 
with daisies, in good proportion to the crocus, 
snowdrop, daffodil, primrose, and similar early 
flowers, much more effective than any body 
who has not seen it can imagine. The quilled 
white, quilled crimson, and double pink, are 
very distinct and beautiful varieties. 



STEPHANOTIS FLORIBUNDA.

STEPHANOTIS FLORIBUNDA. 

(Adolphe Brongniart.) 
MANY-FLOWERED STEPHANOTIS. 

Beautiful in the extreme, and possessing 
a most delicious fragrance, this fine climbing 
plant is admired by all who know it. Its 
beauty is derived from the contrast presented 
between the pearly whiteness of its large, 
profuse, and handsomely formed blossoms, and 
the deep green hue of its ample and enduring 
leaves ; and this beauty, supported as it is by 
a most exquisite fragrance, gives it an indis- 
putable claim to the high estimation in which 
it is held. One drawback alone is attached 
to its high recommendations — it is a tropical 
plant, and must be cultivated in a hothouse. 

But there are hundreds of hothouses in this 
" land of flowers," and in every one of these 
the Stephanotis should find a place ; and not 
only may it claim admission there,— it should 
also claim a participation of those privileges 
which are inseparable from perfection in the 
art of cultivation, and which in this country 
are certainly not " hid under a bushel," but 
are made manifest to all who will " read, mark, 
and learn" them. In no country has the art 
of cultivation been so far perfected as in this ; 
in n other country do there exist such faci- 
lities for acquiring a knowledge of its princi- 
ples and their application. 

To come more closely to our subject. The 
general appearance of Stephanotis Jloribunda 
will be perceived from the accompanying 
sketch. It is a vigorous growing and per- 
manent climbing plant, with evergreen foliage ; 
adapted in its habit, when grown in a pot, to 
cover — say a flat trellis of two yards diameter, 
48 



or a cylindrical one of the same height, and 
two feet or upwards in diameter ; or if planted 
out in a larger bulk of soil, and its branches 
trained, as is sometimes the case, under the 
roof of a hothouse, a healthy plant would ere 
long cover a space of at least five or six square 
yards ; it is also suitable for training on 
pillars. A plant well furnished, of the size 
specified in pots, might be grown in the course 
of two or three seasons ; and in the other case, 
the size of the plant would go on increasing, 
as long as health and vigour were maintained. 
The leaves, it will be seen, are bluntly ellip- 
tical, opposite each other on the branches ; they 
are rather large, thick or leathery, smooth, 
and shining, especially on the upper surface. 
The flowers grow in bunches, or umbels — that 
is, in bunches of six or eight, all issuing from 
the same point at the extremity of the peduncle 
or general stalk, which is attached to the 
branch at the sides, between the bases of the 
leaf-stalks ; they are what are called hypo- 
crateriform, or salver-shaped, that is, with a 
longish almost cylindrical tube, spread out at 
the extremity into five flat segments, which 
in this case are oval and somewhat oblique ; 
the tube is upwards of an inch long, and the 
expanded segments form a spreading " limb" 
as it is termed, more than an inch in diameter ; 
they are pure white. 

It is a native of Madagascar, where some 
other species are also met with. It was raised 
in the Botanic Garden in the Isle of Bourbon, 
from Madagascar seeds, and thence brought 
to the Jardin du Roi, at Paris, where it first 
flowered in 1834. Probably it thence found 
its way to the garden establishments of this 
country about 1835. 

There is nothing very peculiar in the culti- 
vation it requires, for although to secure 
healthy specimens good management is essen- 
tial, the particulars of treatment accord gene- 
rally with those required by other plants. 
Being a permanent plant, and also one which 
attains a considerable size, it requires when 
kept in a pot, to be well potted, and will re- 
quire to be transferred, as its size increases, to 
a larger pot, ultimately requiring a pot of 
considerable size. The permanent nature of 

u

BOTANICAL TERMS. 



the plant, and, in its maturer stages, the mass 
of soil in which it requh*es to be placed, re- 
quires the utmost care in the arrangement of 
the materials forming the compost, and the 
application of the usual forms of drainage. 
Besides a large potsherd formed of a piece of 
broken flower pot, which will be a little 
rounded, and should be laid the convex side 
downwards, a good layer of roundish pieces of 
potsherd, or of broken charcoal, should be laid 
in the bottom ; this layer may occupy about 
one part in six of the depth of the pot, and on 
it should be placed another layer of about the 
same thickness of rough turfy soil, broken 
into lumps of greater or less size according to 
the size of the pot. Then the compost em- 
ployed should consist of rough turfy soil- 
about equal parts of turfy loam and turfy 
heath soil being used, and lightened by the 
addition of silver sand ; the soil should not be 
sifted but broken, so that the largest lumps 
may bear some proportion to the size of the 
pot employed ; thus for a pot six inches deep, 
these lumps may be an inch in diameter, and 
for one two feet deep they may be as much as 
three inches, a fair proportion of the soil being 
broken up finer, and used along with these 
lumps. In potting, the old ball of earth and 
roots must be set so that the fresh soil, when 
the new pot is properly filled up — to within 
about an inch of the top if large — may just 
cover the old. If the plants are not kept in 
pots, but planted out for the purpose of cover- 
ing pillars or trellis work in the hothouse, a 
compartment of at least two feet in diameter 
and the same in depth should be provided for 
the roots, and this is best formed of brickwork, 
so as to prevent the entrance of the roots of 
other more rapid growing plants, to the soil 
provided for the Stephanotis ; if it is conve- 
nient, the size of these compartments may be 
increased as the plants gain size. The com- 
post and its arrangement should be the same 
as in the case of the pots; only here, in propor- 
tion to the difficulty of applying a remedy, the 
necessity of making due provision for the 
drainage of superfluous water is, if possible, 
more peremptory. 

The growing temperature and atmosphere 
of a plant stove suits this plant during its 
period of active growth ; and when at rest in 
winter, the coolness which should ever mark 
the artificial temperature of a plant house at 
that period, will be properly conducive to its 
repose ; then again, in the height of summer, 
when the plant has arrived at a flowering state, 
a warm greenhouse will be suitable for the 
preservation of its blossoms. In short, as 
regards atmosphere and temperature, it may 
be treated exactly as other stove plants of 
a woody character. 

The training of the branches .requires some 



attention. The branches are permanent, and 
require to be managed with this fact in view. 
Pot plants are better trained round cylin- 
drical-shaped trellises, in preference to flat 
ones, which some prefer, but which are found 
not to range well with other plants. Cylin- 
drical trellises are covered by training the 
branches spirally round them, care being taken 
to lead a supply of young shoots to cover every 
part in due proportion. Where they grow too 
thick, the weakest must be removed, and if 
more shoots are wanted than are produced, 
the young ones are to be " topped" as they 
progress, to cause them to produce others. It 
is generally necessary to attend most parti- 
cularly to training a supply of the branches 
downwards, the lower parts being generally 
the worst furnished, unless this is constantly 
attended to. 

Propagation is effected by cuttings planted 
in sand, placed in a gentle hot-bed, covered 
with a bell glass. The young plants when 
rooted require to be very carefully transferred 
to small separate pots, and are the better for 
being grown on for a period with the assist- 
ance of bottom heat. They ought also to be 
grown in rather lighter compost than the 
older plants.

CUT FLOWERS. 
From' Her Majesty to the humblest of her 
humble subjects, the love of flowers seems 
engrafted on our very nature, and young as 
well as old imbibe it rapidly. The infant will 
stretch forth its hand for a daisy or a butter- 
cup, and children of every growth gather them 
with a delight scarcely describable. Of late 
years the taste has been indulged in to such 
an extent by all classes, that there is no fete 
of any importance can take place without 
flowers forming the principal decorations, nor 
is it usual for ladies of any standing to appear 
at the theatre or at balls without their nose- 
gays. Her Majesty on her journeys has been 
again and again presented with flowers. Every 
gentleman who would pay a compliment to a 
lady will, if he be wise, present her with a 
nosegay. Every lady who would have it ap- 
pear that she is not absolutely neglected must 
procure a bouquet ; hopeless is that maiden 
considered who appears in public assemblies 
without a few blossoms of some kind. The 
time of year is no longer admitted as an excuse 
for the absence of nature's favourite gifts ; for 
now flowers can be obtained at all seasons ; 
and despite biting frosts, knee-deep snows, 
and north-east winds, abundance may be pro- 
cured as easily (though not so cheaply) in 
winter months as in the palmy days of summer, 
and hence it becomes merely a question of 
expense. In this country and in Paris a few 
sprigs of bloom is as much as is required, and 
even for that any gentleman disposed to be 
liberal may sometimes spend a guinea. In 
some places the nosegays are too large to carry. 
Flowers, flowers, flowers are the gifts, the 
only really complimentary offerings that can 
be made, without the possibility of offending 
the highest lady in the land. Let us, how- 
ever, admonish the sellers of cut flowers that 
there is yet room for improvement in the 
quality of those offered in general, and those 
who grow for the purpose of supplying them 
should recollect that common, ordinary flowers, 
are not suited to the present day. There are 
plenty of good things that can be grown, and 
they ought to be grown. For even those who 
are unacquainted with flowers begin to see the 
difference between good and bad subjects ; 
and there is as much difference in their use 
fulness for a bouquet, as there is in tinsel and 
gold. Let us observe one property alone — 
the capacity for keeping. The geranium is 
in this particular exceedingly deficient, how- 
ever much it may be tolerated for its beauty 
the short time it does last ; but compare it 
with others of a more permanent character, 
and it becomes almost beneath notice. Wall- 
flowers and stocks are soft flabby subjects, 
though in this case the perfume redeems them. 
Lupins of all kinds are short-lived, and have

no scent to help them out. Sweet peas are 
generally used, but the smell of them, and not 
their appearance, makes them popular. In 
making up large bouquets, all things are used, 
very much to the disadvantage of the nosegay. 
The flowers to use in hand bouquets should be 
of a very superior description to those which 
are now made up. Some of the best flowers 
for cutting and lasting, and for beauty while 
they do last, or for their admirable perfume, 
or their brilliancy, or some very desirable 
property, are the Hoveas, Ericas, Daphnes ; 
the thick petaled Azaleas, Gardenias, Camel- 
lia japonica, especially Sasanqua rosea (the 
smallest), Myrtifolia, Tricolor, and the smaller 
sized ones ; some of the Chorozemas, and the 
Epacrises. The Laurustinus and Andro- 
meda floribunda will help out ; and for bril- 
liance there is not a more beautiful subject 
than the Euphorbia jacquiniflora. Of the 
annuals there are but few that do well for 
small bouquets ; of those that will, Collinsia 
bicolor and Nemophila insignis are the best. 
Convolvulus minor is very beautiful, but can 
rarely be kept open, so that it deteriorates 
after a short time. All the flowers of the 
orange, lemon, and citron tribe are splendid 
subjects. These are the kind of things to 
place in a lady's hand. The ordinary flowers 
at balls and theatres look miserably dull to- 
wards the end of the evening ; but the sorts 
we have mentioned would keep for days were 
they returned to water on being carried home, 
and be better the third night than one of ordi- 
nary flowers would the last half of the first 
evening. But the bouquets of the markets and 
of half the fancy shops are patched up almost 
any how ; odd blooms without stems, stale 
flowers, fastened with all manner of contri- 
vances, and supported altogether with a rim 
of paper, make up what is called a bouquet ; 
whereas if a lady would take the trouble to 
pull it to pieces, and see the sort of rubbish 
it comprises, it would set them against such 
common trash. Let us remind the purchasers 
of nosegays to have no rubbishing paper 
round them, but to order a few good flowers, 
tied simply together by their proper stems 
only, and that in a way not to conceal that 
they are real sprigs of what they profess to 
be, instead of a lot of things adjusted on the 
surface, and huddled together so that not two 
flowers can assume their proper shape, but all 
are alike squeezed, and jammed, and bound so 
that they cannot look well a whole evening. 
Flowers never look so well as when they 
assume their natural position. We know that 
this will force the vendors to have better 
flowers ; and if a lady choose to untie her bou- 
quet afterwards, and put the flowers in water, 
she may use them again and again 5 whereas 
a buncb of the ordinary stuff, with a clipped 



paper round it, would, if untied, be unfit for 
anything. Why, it was the fashion at one 
west-end house to fasten individual flowers on 
wires for stilts, so that in a very short period 
they fade for want of nourishment, even the 
nourishment of a stem. It is true that a few 
flowers, by these means, are made to go a 
great way, but they are of no value as flowers, 
nor are they of any use as a bouquet. Accord- 
ing to our ideas, a bouquet ought to . be com- 
posed of a number of sprigs of such plants as 
we have named in bloom, handsome in them- 
selves separately, as well as in a bunch, and 
some taste should be displayed by the tying 
them together, so as to contrast the colours 
well ; and the first person that puts out bou- 
quets after this fashion will, we have no doubt, 
secure a good trade, for the difference will be 
seen in an instant, and duly appreciated by 
the purchasers of cut flowers. We mean, first, 
substituting good sprigs, with bloom on them, 
for mutilated rubbish that wants manufac- 
turing ; and we mean also, flowers of the 
description we have mentioned, instead of the 
common, soft, flabby subjects, which droop 
directly. Flowers have suffered a good deal 
of odium through the careless — we were going 
to say fraudulent — mode of making up nose- 
gays ; and if the imposition be not promptly 
stopped, ladies will go to the theatre and balls 
without any, rather than such as they have 
hitherto been put off with.

salmon-orange coloured flowers, which are 
large and well formed, and quite distinct. A 
native of Java, on Mount Salak, at an altitude 
of 4,000 feet. Introduced in 1846 by Messrs. 
Veitch. Flowers in May and June. Also called 
Vireyajavanica (Blume) and Azalea javanica

tings in sand in a moderate heat, and by bud- 
ding and grafting. (169) 

Epidendrum plicatum, Lindley (plaited- 
lipped Epidendrum). — Orchidaceas § Epiden- 
dreas-Lasliadas. — A handsome epiphyte, with

which issues the raceme of flowers ; the latter 
are large and showy, the sepals greenish, 
stained with dull purple on both sides, the 
petals green inside, with a few purple stain3 
near the point, and deep rich violet on the 
outside, and the lip rich purple, the central 
lobe beautifully plaited and deeply cordate.

Flowers in January. Culture. — Requires a 
moist stove ; potted in turfy peat; propagated 
by division of the plant. (170) 

Solanum jasminoides, Paxton (jasmine- 
leaved Bitter-sweet). — Solanaceas § Curvem- 
bryas. — An elegant climbing plant, smooth 
both in its stems and leaves. Its leaves are 
sometimes pinnatifid, sometimes ternate, some- 
times quite undivided. The flowers grow 
in cymose panicles at the ends of the shoots ; 
they are shaped like those of the common 
bitter-sweet, and vary from pale bluish lilac 
to nearly white. It is a very pretty climber, 
but probably not really distinct from the old 
S. Seaforthianum. Its native country is not 
certainly known, but it is " considered to be 
South American." Introduced about 1839.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY. 







THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 

Sow beans, borage, cabbages, carrots, cori- 
ander, chervil, cress, endive, kidney-beans, 
lettuce, onions, parsley, peas, radishes, rape, 
rampion, scurvy-grass, salads, spinach, and 
turnip. 

Plant and Transplant borecole, brocoli, 
cauliflowers, cabbage, celery, celeriac, endive, 
leeks, lettuce, mint, potato, and savoy. 

General Directions Continue to sow and 

plant successional autumn and winter crops. 
Attend to hoeing and weeding. Prick out 
and thin out seedlings : gather ripening seeds 
and herbs. Clear the ground as the crops are 
used up. Water where required, especially 
crops that are now planting. 

Asparagus. — Follow up the operation of 
watering, if the weather is dry, and discon- 
tinue the cutting from the established beds ; 
make them perfectly clean by hand-weeding. 

Beans. — If the early crops were broken 
over last month, another sowing now would 
be superfluous. 

Borage. — A sowing of this may be made 
in any common soil and place ; they do not 
require much care. 

Borecole. — Plant these out on the potato 
ground, or where any spare place can be [ 
obtained, for use in spring. 

Brocoli. — Make full plantings at the be- 
ginning and end of the month ; they will 



follow other crops as the latter are cleared 
off. 

Cabbage. — Plant late for coleworts ; and 
prick out and sow a few more early, to plant 
in autumn for winter and spring use. 

Carrots. — A few may be sown on good 
ground, if a supply of j oung ones is wanted ; 
thin out and hoe the advancing crops. 

Cauliflowers. — Plant a full crop at the end 
of the month, and prepare or reserve ground 
for sowing on next month. 

Celeriac. — Plant out early in a plain bed, 
in rows fifteen inches apart, and ten inches 
between. 

Celery. — A main planting may be made 
early this month ; and prepare to make another 
at the end. 

Chervil. — Unless a sufficient number of 
self-sown plants have sprung up, it will be 
well to scatter a few seeds in any spare 
corner. 

Coriander. — Sow on a bed of good fresh 
earth, in an open situation. 

Cress. — Make a considerable sowing of the 
common kind for succession ; and sow also, at 
the end of the month, the Normandy, for 
autumn use. 

Endive. — For a winter and spring crop, 
sow at the end of the month : plant out a few, 
watering them well. 

Garlic. — Lift the bulbs when the leaves 
turn yellow, dry them carefully, and put away 
the sound ones for winter use. 

Herbs of all sorts should be gathered and 
dried when about to bloom ; they may be 
propagated now, as required. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY. 



301 



Kidney Beans. — The last planting should 
now be made in a warm spot, and the earlier 
the better. Water the drills before sowing, 
if the soil is dry. 

Leeks. — A few may still be planted out ; hoe 
and earth up the crops beginning to grow freely. 

Lettuce. — Plant again for succession ; also 
sow every three weeks : if they are thinned in 
the bed, they will come into use earlier, and 
the thinnings if planted out will form a suc- 
cession. 

Mint. — Cut, and dry in a shady place 
when coming in flower : if required, the roots 
can easily be divided now, and increased. 

Onions. — The winter crop should be ripe ; 
gather them and store away carefully : make 
a small sowing to draw young for salads ; pre- 
pare ground to sow next month. 

Parsley. — Thin out the early sowings ; to 
secure a fresh and vigorous supply through 
the winter, sow on a warm spot, where a frame 
could be placed over it in autumn and winter. 

Peas. — Stake advancing crops : put in the 
last sowing about the middle of the month, 
and let it be an early sort ; also make a sow- 
ing immediately, and see that the spot is 
warm : top the late sorts when about four 
feet high, and water all with a weak solution 
of nitrate of soda. 

Potatoes. — Dig between the rows previous 
to earthing up. Chapman's kidneys, planted 
now, will supply new potatoes in winter. 

Radishes. — Continue to sow for succession 
in a cool moist situation ; if they are much 
in demand, sow a few once a fortnight ; the 
turnip-rooted kinds do best at this season. 

Rampion. — Gather the seed, and sow at 
once, on a light, rich, and moist soil ; rake the 
seed lightly in. 

Rape. — Sow at the end of the month ; it is 
hardy, and not particular as to soil. 

Salads. — Continue to sow nearly every two 
weeks the small things, as mustard and cress ; 
half as much seed of the former as of the latter 
will suffice ; grow all fast so as to be tender. 

Savoys. — Plant out more where there is 
room ; hoe amongst the others. 

Scarlet-runners must have branched stakes 
put to them at once, if not already done ; they 
should be from five to eight feet high ; they 
are all the better for being sometimes topped. 

Scurvy-grass may be sown now, or the roots 
of the established plants may be parted ; it is 
used as a salad, and medicinally. 

Shallots will be ready, or nearly so, for 
taking up and getting dried in an airy place, 
previous to storing. 

Spinach. — Prepare ground for the August 
sowing : sow early this month for succession ; 
thin out the previous crops. 

TurnijJS. — Make a full sowing now ; hoe 
and thin the others to six inches apart. 



THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General directions. — Persevere in thinning, 
pruning and nailing, shortening the young 
shoots only where more wood is required. 
Commence budding. Protect the fruit against 
the ravages of birds, wasps, &c. ; and gather it 
as it ripens. Have the fruit-room thoroughly 
washed and cleaned, before any of the kinds are 
put into it. Hoe as much as ever, and destroy 
insects : transplanted and heavily-laden trees 
are bettered for mulching and watering, if the 
weather is dry. Sometimes it is desirable to 
prop up the branches of trees heavily laden. 

Apples. — Remove the breast wood from 
espaliers and wall trees ; also partially thin 
the standards, and tolerate no overloading 
deformed fruit. 

Apricots. — Secure and nail in the young 
shoots ; slight thinnings may also be effected : 
have all the fruit exposed as much as possible 
to the sun. In good seasons, early sorts may 
be gathered at the end of the month, they will 
preserve for a few days if laid in a cool place. 
Bud choice sorts on plum stocks. 

Cherries. — Protect and gather carefully ; 
also prepare the later sorts for being netted. 
Bud on the wild black cherry stock. 

Currants may now be much improved by 
judicious thinning, both of wood and fruit, yet it 
is seldom attended to, unless when they are 
grown for competition. 

Figs. — Give all possible light and air to the 
fruit, yet do not take off a leaf if it can be 
avoided ; remove any late and crude growth. 

Gooseberries. — Thin out those to be used 
for dessert ; also, thin out the young wood 
where necessary. Cuttings of the young shoots 
planted now will be rooted by autumn ; and 
this plan is useful where it is desired to in- 
crease any choice variety. 

Nectarines may now be budded upon the in- 
ferior peach and nectarine trees ; the branches 
of which may be afterwards lopped off as the 
buds succeed. The best stock, however, is the 
muscle plum : hasten on the ripening of the 
wood and fruit, which thinning and nailing 
assists materially. 

Peaches require the same treatment. Mulch 
and water the transplanted trees, also those 
with heavy crops ; do not let the young trees 
bear too many fruit. 

Pears. — The breast wood must now be 
broken down, and the leaders tied and nailed in, 
whether in walls or espaliers. Look over stand- 
ards also, and thin where necessary ; regulate 
the growth of grafts and young trees. Make 
provision for young bearing wood on the old 
wall trees, by laying in plenty of young shoots. 
Bud on pear or quince stocks : those budded 
as standards, say from four to six feet high, 
bear soonest ; but low budding about six 
inches from the erround is most commendable 



302 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY. 



Plums. — Many kinds bear best on the 
young wood ; provide accordingly : give a 
final thinning to the fruit. 

Raspberries, if not ripe, will be much bene- 
fited by a good watering of clear liquid 
manure. Do not damage the suckers which 
are to form next year's bearing shoots. 

Strawberries. — Special attention is requi- 
site now to get a stock prepared for forcing ; 
indeed, upon attending to this early, much of 
the success depends : lay the runner into three 
inch pots, and on the runner place a stone to 
keep it steady ; use a soil of rich loam, with a 
little leaf mould, or very rotten manure : they 
may be laid into larger pots at once. Cover 
up the ripening fruit from birds ; and those 
to be used for preserving must be gathered 
perfectly dry. 

Vines. — Forward, by exposing the fruit as 
much as can be to the influence of the sun ; 
and take away all the after growth, in the 
form of laterals, &c. 

THE FORCE\G-GARDEN. 

General Directions. — The late crops will 
be at their utmost luxuriance, and a gradual, 
not sudden pruning must be attended to. 
Those houses and places where the crops are 
being cleared, must have continued drought, 
until all the fruit is gone ; when in some I 
cases, a thorough syringing, and a throwing 
open must take place ; in others, a cutting 
back to force for another crop. In all cases, I 
take the outline of treatment from what nature !, 
gives ; and if possible, assist and improve I 
upon it ; and, although, in a certain sense, we | 
cannot surpass nature, yet, from certain arti- ! 
ficial adaptations, we can aid her, and we may 
be sure she will amply repay all our toils. 

Apricots. — Temperature, from 60 to 80 \ 
degrees by day, and 55 degrees at night. ' 
They should be ripe ; gather them in the 
morning : hang up Avide-mouthed bottles half 
full of sugared beer, to entrap wasps, ants, &c. ; 
they require to be cleaned occasionally. When 
the fruit is cleared, expose the trees, and give 
them a thorough syringing. 

Cherries. — Temperature ranging from 45 
to 70 degrees. Give air very freely, and, if 
practicable, strip the house ; or if the plants 
are moveable, they should be set out doors. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature from 60 to 90 
degrees. Go over those lately planted, and ; 
thin gradually ; avoid impregnation, except ! 
for seed ; cut back the early plants and start ! 
anew, if not already done. Water all with I 
liquid manure, and shut up with a brisk heat, ! 
even so early as two, p.m., after watering. [ 
The fruit should be cut whenever ready, and 
their stalks placed in water : they also keep ! 
well if laid on a sward of green turf in a cool ! 
shed, and covered with a hand-glass. 



Figs. — Temperature from 50 to 80 degrees. 
The ripe fruit is readily distinguished by a 
pearly drop seen at the eye of the fruit, or by 
the decay of the stalk ; it must be gently 
handled, and used as soon as gathered. 

Melons. — Temperature from 65 to 90 
degrees. Some of the more hardy sorts will 
do in a very warm place out of doors, but not 
without trouble and uncertainty. The early 
plants which were cut back for another crop, 
should have liquid manure in addition to some 
fresh soil, and should be kept rather close ; 
give air night and day when the ripening fruit 
is cut ; and when cut, lay it in a cool place, 
for a day or two. Thin and regulate in good 
time — almost daily, at certain stages. If can- 
ker appear, apply more heat, less moisture, 
and dust the affected .parts with lime. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature from 55 to 60 
degrees. Beds are successfully formed and 
treated out of doors ; still this can be done 
with equal facility in a house appropriated to 
them, if insufficiency of room is no objection : 
slight waterings all over the house are 
beneficial. 

Musas. — Temperature from 60 to 90 de- 
grees. Still treat lavishly, withholding sti- 
mulants, in some measure, from those which 
are ripening off their fruit. 

Nectarines. — Temperature from 55 to 80 
degrees. Give air night and day ; also to the 
late houses. Entrap the wasps, &c, with 
bottles of beer and sugar. 

Peaches. — Temperature from 55 to 80 
degrees. The early houses should be thrown 
open ; those in which the fruit is in a forward 
state, should be sparingly watered ; and the 
latest ones kept with a moist steady heat, and 
plenty of air. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature from 65 to 90 
degrees. Maintain a lively moist heat in all 
the departments, but keep the fruiting pit 
driest. Sprinkle over the leaves in the morn- 
ing and early in the afternoon, at the latter 
period using clear liquid manure. Turn out 
one or two of the succession plants, and by 
their state decide about the time of shifting 
them ; have the requisite soils, as strong loam 
and peat, and charcoal and other drainage, 
always in readiness. Give a little air at night 
to prevent weakness ; and a slight shading for 
an hour or two in very scorching weather is 
commendable, especially to the shifted plants, 
and those near the glass. Keep the path- 
ways, flues, &c, in a damp state. 

Vinery. — Temperature from 60 to 80 de- 
grees. Where the ripening and ripe grapes 
are, the atmosphere must be kept dry, and air 
given abundantly. In the later houses thin 
the shoots and fruit with freedom, and repeat 
the operation ; maintain a steady moisture, 
and syringe gently. Syringing (where a moist

303 



atmosphere can be attained and kept up) is 
almost unnecessary, the more so that fire-heat 
can now almost be done without. 

FLOWER GARDEN AND SHRUBBERY. 

Sow early a few more annuals to bloom 
late in the season ; also a few biennials and 
perennials. 

Plant and Transplant all hardy and half- 
hardy annuals ; also greenhouse plants, 
wherever required to fill up vacancies in the 
beds or borders; such as are planted out of 
pots, should have the balls of earth a little 
loosened ; give them all thorough waterings. 

General Directions. — Get up, without 
delay, all tuberous roots, as anemones and 
ranunculus, also tulips, &c, and have their 
places immediately filled with annuals brought 
on in pots, such as stocks, &c. ; greenhouse 
plants will also come in. Attend to staking 
and tying up every plant that requires it. Go 
on with the mowing and its accompaniments. 
Persevere with the propagating of herbaceous 
and shrubbery plants by layers, cuttings, slips, 
and budding. Have everything that is to be 
planted out done as soon as possible. 

Alpines. — Go over and cut away the dead 
flower stalks, and free them from weeds ; 
make the drainage perfect ; of course they are 
kept in a shady situation. Foster and increase 
the most interesting, whether from rarity, 
beauty, or curiosity ; keep those dryish that 
have died down ; and the whole would be 
bettered by a slight top dressing. Some skill 
must be exercised here as to the watering of 
those which are growing, and those which are 
matured ; the former, of course, require the 
largest supplies. 

Anemones. — Those lifted last month may 
now be stored away carefully, and the late 
tubers should be taken up, where in beds, and 
laid out to dry. 

Annuals sown now, must have good situa- 
tions to flower this season. This is a good 
time to sow stocks, mignonette, &c, to flower 
in pots through the early part of the winter. 
Remove those past a flowering state, and if 
not before, refill their vacancies with others, 
or something ready to flower. 

Auriculas. — Continued attention to stirring 
the soil, drainage, and picking off the dead 
leaves, is necessary. Those whose leaves, as 
it were, roof over the soil in the pots, must be 
carefully watered. 

Brugmansias, or Daturas. — These are fine 
objects in the flower-garden, either planted 
out or plunged ; give them a sheltered spot, 
and apply liquid manure largely. 

Carnations. — Tie loosely, and so as the tie 
may slip up a little with the increasing growth. 
As the buds indicate bursting, open the calyx 
gently at each division, doAvn to the bass or 



worsted tie around the middle, and as the 
large petals develope, draw them down care- 
fully to the card ; those show flowers with 
faulty petals must have them withdrawn : 
apply now a little liquid manure, and at other 
times use pure rain or river water : go on 
with the propagating. 

Chrysanthemums. — Now is an excellent 
time to strike a number, by taking off the 
strongest tops of the shoots three inches 
long, and potting them in small single pots, 
and putting them in a little heat ; when 
struck, harden them off, shift them, and place 
them in a warm and sunny situation, plunging 
the pots, if possible. Prepare to lay a quan- 
tity early next month. 

Dahlias. — See that the supports for the 
plants are sufficient, as a gust of wind may in 
a moment render all previous care, as well as 
the plant for the future, useless : remove the 
weak and over-crowded laterals, and those 
only; propagate the fine sorts ; the roots so 
formed, and allowed to ripen and remain in 
the cutting pots, are the most valuable ; it 
may also be well to bear in mind, that those 
roots much stimulated by liquid manure, are 
not to be depended upon. Untiringly attend 
to keep down insects, and water profusely. 

Erythrina cristagalli forms a most noble 
plant as a single specimen ; plant or plunge in 
rich turfy loam and dung. In the south and 
west of England it will stand as a hardy peren- 
nial under favourable circumstances. 

Fuchsias. — Hasten them on with liquid 
manure ; few things grow quicker under this 
treatment : starve them a little towards the 
end of the month. 

Hollyhocks must be thinned, and have long 
and strong stakes put to them ; their grandeur 
will be enhanced by giving them clear liquid 
manure once a week. 

Jasmines, Honeysuckles, and all fast grow- 
ing climbing plants, should be now looked 
over, pruned, and nailed in, or tied up, as the 
case may be. 

Lobelias. — Encourage these by watering the 
strong growing sorts with liquid manure ; keep 
them at all times well supplied with water. 

Mignonette luxuriates in liquid manure, 
whether prepared from guano, pigeons' dung, 
or the stable-yard : water only at the roots, 
and sow in pots for winter. 

Pansies. — Plant out the seedlings in a rich 
soil of loam and leaf mould, or rotten dung and 
sand ; propagate from the old and good sorts ; 
they will strike readily under a hand-light in a 
shady situation, amongst sand and leaf mould. 

Picotees. — Remove the self or run petals 
from the show flowers as soon as they appear; 
they must have cards, the same as carnations, 
upon which the guard petals are to be evenly 
laid back ; it matters not whether the card 



304 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY. 



has a hole in it or not, if a small space in the 
centre is cut across three times, making six 
angular points : propagate by layers, and 
treat every way as carnations. 

Rinks. — Cut off the dead flower stalks ; 
propagate quickly ; the pipings strike readily 
under a hand-light, keeping the sand moist ; 
they will also strike without sand, and some 
prefer it. 

Moses. — Strike the China varieties in a 
slight heat ; indeed we have seen every sort, 
even the moss, so struck, but it is uncertain; 
the Hybrid Chinas succeed in this way admi- 
rably. All may be, and should be budded 
this month, if to be done at all ; and the 
quicker the operation is gone through the 
better. Take off all the faded and fading 
flowers, syringe with tobacco water to destroy 
aphides ; follow it up until they are over- 
come. 

Ranunculus. — Take up as soon as the 
leaves fade, otherwise they are subject to the 
attacks of vermin. Treat them as those lifted 
last month, and mark them carefully before 
putting them away. 

Stocks. — It is not too late to make another 
planting ; they are hardier than most other 
things, and equal in beauty. 

Tulips. — Take up, dry, and store away ; and 
so with other spring bulbs. The hyacinth 
may be considered an exception, for without 
extra care they are seldom so good the second 
season, and it is generally considered more 
economical to purchase the imported bulbs 
annually. 

Violets. — Encourage the plants by stirring, 
and in some cases renewing the surface soil ; 
look often at them, and many things will sug- 
gest themselves, as being not only beneficial, 
but necessary, for which no directions could 
have been given ; they must not be suffered to 
become dry, and rather prefer shady and 
moist treatment. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

The point of first importance is, never to 
allow any of the plants to suffer from dryness 
at the root. Keep them regularly watered, 
and syringed over the foliage, so as to render 
them perfectly clear of dust. Use manure 
water of any description occasionally, to any 
of the strong growing plants ; but do not use 
it in too great quantities, or too strong, as in 
either case the plants will grow away to leaf 
and branches, and comparatively few flowers 
would be produced. Remove the fading flow- 
ers or foliage, and regularly train the plants to 
the particular object in view, especially the 
climbers, which, if neglected for any length 
of time, will become unmanageable. 

Bulbs, as hyacinths, &c, should have the 
supply of water gradually reduced, as the foli- 



age attains its full growth, and begins to 
wither, so as to enable the roots to become 
thoroughly ripened. 

Begonias will require a considerable supply 
of moisture in dry weather, but it should drain 
freely away from the pot ; stake and train out 
as necessary. 

Camellias. — Encourage a vigorous growth 
by regular waterings, and keep the foliage 
clean by copious syringing, and even by hand 
washing when necessary. Lessen the supply 
of water to such as have completed their 
growth. , 

Cinerarias should be shaded from fierce 
sunlight, and kept cool at the root by liberal 
waterings. 

Fuchsias. — Regulate as they advance in 
growth, and water copiously, as, if they get 
too dry, they will shed the greater part of their 
leaves and flowers. Use manure water occa- 
sionally. Shift them when the pots get full 
of roots. 

Geraniums. — Those out of bloom should be 
cut down to within a few eyes of the old wood, 
and placed in a hot situation fully exposed to 
the sun. Water sparingly, so as not to excite 
them into renewed growth, but to enable them 
to thoroughly ripen the wood previous to pre- 
paring them for the next season. 

Myrtles, and other evergreens, should be 
freely watered, especially if much exposed to 
the sun : syringe often, so as to keep the 
leaves free from dust. 

Roses. — Keep the old flowers cut off as 
they decay, and prune back the old flowering 
branches to the new shoot or bud from which 
the next flowers will proceed in the Chinese 
and allied sorts. Water these copiously, using 
manure water occasionally. 

Primulas. — Shift as the plants require it, 
keeping them in a cool place, shaded from the 
direct rays of the sun ; w r ater freely. 

Violets. — Those planted out for potting up 
in autumn, should be well watered in dry 
weather, and the ground kept well stirred 
amongst them to encourage a vigorous growth ; 
keep them clear of weeds. 

IVardian Cases. — Replace any deaths by 
introducing new plants, and regulate the esta- 
blished ones, so as to prevent their interfering 
too much with one another. The dw T arf grow- 
ing cacti do very well in these cases, and, if 
planted on a piece of rockwork, are very in- 
teresting, from the great number of dissimilar 
forms which may be grown in very limited 
space. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

The principal operations will consist in 
forwarding the growth of such plants as are 
placed in these structures for that purpose. In 
nearly all cases a great quantity of air must 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOE, JULY. 



305 



be given, and sometimes the lights should be 
wholly removed at night. 

Annuals. — If any are still left, they should 
be shifted as they require it, and occasionally 
supplied with liquid manure. About the end 
of the month some ten-week stock seed should 
be sown, to produce plants to bloom early in 
spring. 

Half-hardy 2Jlants, as petunias, verbenas, 
&c, should be propagated as fast as cuttings 
can be procured, especially any new sorts, or 
such as may be particularly desirable. Those 
which are intended for forcing, as pelargoni- 
ums, heliotropes, calceolarias, &c, should be 
grown away, and be kept regularly stopped 
so as to form bushy heads, and also to prevent 
their flowering. Keep them regularly shifted 
until they are in the required size pot, and 
shade them as soon as the sun acts power- 
fully on the glass, especially when fresh 
shifted. 

Green-house plants placed in these struc- 
tures to make their summer growth, must 
be regularly and copiously supplied with water, 
both at the root and over head!, Shift when 
necessary, especially the stronger growing 
sorts : shade in bright weather, but remove 
the lights entirely at night, in fierce weather, 
and protect them from heavy rains. Stop, 
thin, and tie out the shoots as they advance in 
growth. 

Forcing Pit. — Many bulbs will have per- 
fected their growth, and as the leaves be- 
gin to decay, gradually reduce the quantity 
of water until they are perfectly dry, keeping 
them near the glass, and thoroughly exposed 
to the sun to ripen. Keep all growing plants 
regularly watered and syringed, night and 
morning, and maintain a moist atmosphere by 
evaporating pans, and by constantly watering 
the walks. Shade such plants as soon as the 
sun-heat becomes powerful, and give air 
freely. 

THE GREEN-HOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 60 degrees to 70 de- 
grees by day ; and from 50 to 60 degrees by 
night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely, so as to keep 
the temperature nearly as indicated above. 
Air should be left on all night, except in wet 
or windy weather, when all should be made 
secure before the house is left. 

Watering. — Never allow any plant to flag 
or droop its leaves for want of moisture ; and 
be sure those in pots are thoroughly soaked 
through the ball : syringe freely, especially in 
the evening in bright weathei*, so as to allow 
the plants to recruit their strength before 
morning. 

Potting. — Continue to shift such plants as 
require it as they advance in growth ; in doing 
48. 



so, loosen the old ball of earth so as to make 
sure that it will not remain as a lump in the 
centre of the new soil, into which water cannot 
penetrate. Keep the plants close and shaded 
until they recommence their growth, when 
they will also need a more liberal supply of 
water than immediately after being shifted. 

Soils, $'c. — Take all opportunities to in- 
crease the store of materials for different com- 
posts, and keep them in large heaps at present, 
so that they may not get too dry for use. The 
pots in which the summer bedding plants were 
grown, should be washed, sorted, and stacked, 
ready for use again ; if in a shed or other dry 
place, they will be handier for use at any time. 

Dressing. — Keep every thing neat and 
clean ; tie up climbers, and stop such as re- 
quire it. See that the leaves of the plants 
are perfectly clean, and free from dirt and 
dust. 

Insects. — Destroy all of an injurious cha- 
racter as soon as they make their appearance. 
Guard in particular in the hot dry weather 
against thrip and red spider, especially on the 
climbers and taller plants, where they some- 
times escape notice until considerable damage 
is done. 

Aloes and succulents generally should be 
kept growing by a good supply of moisture 
and free exposure to light, heat, and air. 

Agaves and large succulents should be 
grown fast, by placing them in a hot exposure, 
and watering them freely. An occasional dose 
of manure water will be serviceable. 

Alstromerias. — Such as have done flowering 
should have the supply of water gradually 
reduced as the foliage decays and the seed- 
vessels ripen. They should be placed in a hot 
sunny exposure, but where they may be sheltered 
from heavy rains. 

Annuals. — Remove those in a shabby state, 
and replace them with some of the later sown 
crops. Supply them abundantly with water, 
and keep them near the light, and give them 
air freely to prevent their drawing up weakly. 

Azaleas. — Place such as have perfected their 
growth out of doors in a sheltered situation, 
where they can be protected from heavy rains. 
Forward the growth of the later plants, so 
that they may begin their rest before the heat 
of the autumn is passed. 

Calceolarias. — Cut down the old plants, 
and propagate from the best of the cuttings. 
Keep the plants in a cool frame facing the 
north, and shade in bright weather. Water 
freely, and guard against green fly, whose 
attacks are peculiarly hurtful to these plants. 

Camellia s.— Place such as have completed 
their growth out of doors, in a situation where 
they will be shaded from the mid-day sun, and 
also protected from too much moisture. Keep 
the smaller plants in pits, giving plenty of air, 



306 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY 



shading during bright sunshine, and taking 
the lights off on warm nights. Such as have 
not completed their growth should be kept 
moderately close and warm, and in a shady 
part of the house. 

Cape Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c, should 
be gradually dried off, and kept exposed to the 
full light and heat of the sun, in any situation 
where they can be protected from heavy rains. 
Cephalotus follicidaris (New Holland 
pitcher-plant). — Keep in a shady but airy 
situation, and do not let it suffer for want of 
moisture. 

Cinerarias. — Shift such as require it, and 
grow them in cold frames or pits facing the 
north ; water freely, occasionally with manure 
water ; shade during bright weather, and 
remove the lights at night. Pot off a succes- 
sional batch of suckers, and treat them like 
the others, keeping the frames rather close 
until they are well rooted. 

Chrysanthemums. — Layer those turned out, 
into small pots filled with rich sandy soil, and 
fix them by using pegs long enough to pene- 
trate four or five inches through the pot into 
the ground beneath. Water regularly. Shift 
such as require it, and stop the shoots so as to 
make them branch : keep them in a rather 
shady place, and water freely, occasionally with 
manure water. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, as semper- 
vivum, should be sparingly watered, if they 
have stopped growing j if otherwise, water 
abundantly, and expose them to the greatest 
amount of light and heat attainable with a 
free circulation of air. 

Cyclamens should be kept so dry as not to 
shrivel up too much ; place them in an airy 
situation. 

Epacris. — Grow away in the house or in 
pits, shading in bright weather, and maintain- 
ing a free circulation of air about the pots and 
plants. Be very attentive in watering, that 
the balls be thoroughly soaked. 

Ericas. — Shift such as require it, and stop 
those that are growing in a straggling manner ; 
place the coarser growing sorts in a sheltered 
situation under an awning, by which they can 
be protected from the sun and rain, but roll it 
up on every fine night, so as to expose the 
plants to the action of the dew or light 
showers. In potting use plenty of drainage, 
so as to ensure the rapid passage of the 
superfluous moisture when the plants are 
watered. They now require water often, and 
in considerable quantity, so as to ensure the 
earth being kept in a regular moist state. 
The smaller plants and more tender species 
should be grown in pits, where they should be 
kept near the glass, and freely ventilated ; 
they should also be exposed at night in very 
fine weather. 



Fuchsias. — Shift such as require it, especially 
if large specimens are wanted: water copiously, 
occasionally using manure water. Cut back 
some, to form a fresh growth to bloom late in 
autumn, and propagate any desirable sorts. 
Fumigate if the green fly makes its appear- 
ance, and syringe to check red spider. 

Gompholobiums and slender creepers should 
be regularly trained to their trellises, so that 
every part may be equally furnished with 
young wood, avoiding too upright a direction, 
in order to prevent the young shoots from 
bunching at the top of the trellis, and thus 
leaving the bottom bare. 

Haworthias, Apicras, &c. — Keep them in 
a warm situation, and water freely if they are 
in a growing state. Expose them fully to the 
sun, and maintain a free circulation of air 
about the pots and plants. 

Helichrysums. — Grow these in a light airy 
situation, and water freely as long as they are 
growing, guarding against stagnant water about 
the roots at all times. 

Leschenaultias. — Shift if necessary, and 
keep the plants in a light airy situation, 
shading in the middle of the day ; such as 
have completed their growth may be put 
on an airy stage in the house, and the sup- 
ply of water may be gradually lessened for a 
time. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan Lily). — Keep in 
an airy and rather cool place, and water freely 
as they advance towards flowering, using 
manure water occasionally. 

Mignonette. — Sow in pots out of doors, to 
introduce when in a flowering state; stop and 
train the plants intended for trees or bushes 
to a single stem, cutting out all the flower buds 
entirely. 

New Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, bos- 
sia?as, &c. — Water regularly, and stop luxuriant 
shoots so as to form a neat_ head : shade the 
more delicate sorts, and guard against worms 
in the pots. 

Orange Trees. — Water and syringe copiously, 
using manure water about once a week while 
plants are growing. Regulate the heads, and 
protect those out of doors from damage by 
strong winds. 

Oxalis. — Withhold water from those whose 
foliage is dead, and place the pots in a dry, hot, 
and airy situation. 

Pelargoniums. — Cut down those out of 
flower, and place them out in a hot dry ex- 
posure, giving very little water, and protecting 
them from heavy rains. Those which were 
earlier treated thus should now be potted : 
shake the old earth entirely away from the 
roots, and prune them well in ; pot them in 
small pots, using a sandy, rather poor com- 
post ; place them in rather close frames, and 
water very sparingly. Sow seed as soon as it 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY. 



307 



ripens, and pot off the plants as soon as they 
have formed about three rough leaves. 

Primulas. — Sow the seeds now for a main 
supply ; use a compost of free loam and peat, 
with a sufficiency of sand to keep it porous ; 
sow thinly and cover lightly. Propagate the 
double varieties by parting the old plants into 
separate crowns or shoots, and pot them, or 
make cuttings of them, as they may have roots 
or not ; keep them close in a pit, and rather 
dry until they commence to grow again. 

Protects, Banksias, Dryandras, &c. — Water 
carefully, and regulate their growth so as to 
form neat plants ; if placed out of doors, pro- 
tect from high winds and heavy rains. 

Rhododendrons. — Plunge the pots in earth 
or ashes, and mulch the surface with moss or 
other material, to prevent the action of the. sun 
on the young roots at the side of the pot. 
Water regularly and copiously, and keep the 
leaves clean by syringing. 

Roses. — Young plants of the Chinese and 
related sorts should be shifted as they require 
it, and the shoots should be shortened so as to 
produce a regular head : protect the pots of 
those placed out of doors in a similar way to 
that recommended for Rhododendrons. Use 
manure water occasionally, and syringe with 
dilute tobacco water whenever the green fly 
appears. 

Salvias. — Shift, stop, and regulate the 
plants as they advance, and remove the flowers 
from such as are wanted for late bloom. 
Propagate by cuttings in a slight bottom heat. 

Stapelias. — Continue to water freely as they 
advance, keeping them in a wai'm airy place, 
and strong light ; watch the drainage, that no 
stagnant water may lodge about the roots. 

Tropceolums. — Dry off the bulbs as the 
foliage decays, and keep them dry until they 
break naturally. Care should be taken that 
after being dry some time, they do not get 
accidentally wetted, as they are liable to start 
off into a weak spindling growth. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature. — From 60 to 70 degrees by 
day, and from 55 to GO degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Maintain a free circulation, 
and leave considerable air on all night in hot 
weather : allow no openings on the sides 
affected by strong winds. 

Watering. — Water should be applied freely 
to all plants in bloom, or making their growth; 
such as are planted out should be carefully 
examined at the root, and well soaked : 
syringe night and morning, cleaning up all 
water from the paths in the morning, that they 
may be early dry. 

Arrangement. — As a great portion of the 
plants now in flower here, consist of annuals, 
great variety may be obtained by continually 



altering, contrasting, and harmonizing the 
various colours, placing them sometimes in 
masses of one colour or sort, at others, blend- 
ing all together, of course avoiding as far as 
possible all straight lines. 

General Directions, — Gontinue to maintain 
the most scrupulous neatness in every respect. 
Watch for insects, especially the red spider, 
and apply immediate remedies. Constantly 
tie up, stop, and regulate the climbing-plants, 
taking care that they are properly thinned, so 
as not to present a heavy appearance in the 
house. Remove all plants as soon as they look 
at all past their prime, especially annuals, 
which soon present a shabby appearance at 
this season. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature. — From 70 to 85 degrees by 
day, and from 60 to 70 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely, as far as the 
weather permits, closing the house early in the 
afternoon. Open very little on the windy 
side, not at all in high winds. 

Watering. — Use water abundantly to the 
roots and leaves, by the syringe and as steam. 
Keep the floors flooded, and the evaporating 
pans full. Syringe night and morning, and 
fill the house with steam at the same times. 

Potting. — Continue to shift all such as re- 
quire it, apportioning the size of the pots to 
the strength of the growth. . Stake, stop, and 
otherwise regulate the plant at the same time. 
Keep them close and shaded until they make 
fresh root. 

Insects. — Use every exertion to keep these 
under, as soon as they show themselves ; plants 
very foul with scale or mealy bug should be 
destroyed, or kept apart from the others, and 
not admitted to the collection until perfectly 
clean. 

Achimenes. — Pot any bulbs which may be 
left, or shift such as have been grown in a low 
temperature, and exrfte them to increased 
growth ; they will be useful in autumn and 
winter. Shift such as require it, and remove 
those in bloom to the conservatory. 

Allamanda, Beaumontia, Eckites, and other 
strong growing climbers, must be regularly 
stopped and trained as they advance. Water 
liberally, and syringe as often as possible. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, should be shifted as they require it, and 
any in bloom should be removed to a warm 
part of the conservatory ; abundance of water 
should be given until the leaves begin to 
decay. 

Aflielandras, Justicias, Ruellias, &c. — Shift 
and regulate as they advance in growth ; 
water copiously, and syringe often, as they are 
very subject to red spider. 

Amaryllids. — Diminish the supply of water

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR JULY. 



as the leaves decay, and remove the pots to a 
dry and hot exposure ; place them on their 
sides to avoid accidental wettings. 

Begonias. — Encourage as they advance, 
and remove the flowering ones to the con- 
servatory ; pot any intended for winter flower- 
ing, or such as flower naturally then and in the 
spring. 

Burchellia. — Propagate hy cuttings of the 
half-ripened wood, in sand, under a bell glass, 
in bottom heat. 

Cacti. — Pinch the ends of the shoots of 
such as have nearly completed their growth, 
and reduce the allowance of water. Set out 
such as are intended to be forced in a hot dry 
place where they can be protected from rain. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — Water 
regularly and carefully as it advances, and 
keep the foliage very clean. 

Clerodendrons. — Remove the flowering 
plants to cooler quarters : increase desirable 
sorts by cuttings of the young wood in heat. 

Climbers. — Continue to stop, tie up, and 
regulate as requisite ; water freely, especially 
those turned out in the borders. 

Daturas. — Shift as necessaiy, and train to 
a single stem ; water freely, using manure 
water often. 

Erythrinas. — Cut down any out of flower, 
and put them out in the sun without water 
for a fortnight ; then repot them, and grow 
away again for another bloom. 

Euphorbias. — Reduce the water to any 
wdrich appear to have set their growth. 

Ferns. — Keep very damp and shady. They 
may be propagated by division at almost any 
period ; keep them close until they root. 

Gardenias. — Propagate by cuttings of the 
young wood, in sand, in a strong bottom heat ; 
keep them moist and close. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Water the 
growing plants freely; those out of bloom 
sparingly. Pot roots of Gesnera zebrina for 
winter flowering. 

Hippeastrum, Crinums, Pancratiums, &c. 
— Reduce the supply of moisture as the leaves 
decay, and withhold it altogether from such 
as entirely lose the foliage ; the others should 
be watered more sparingly as their leaves 
attain their full size. 

Ipom&as. — Shift as necessary, water freely, 
and guard against red spider, which soon 
injures the foliage of these plants. 

Ixoras. — Propagate by cuttings of half- 
ripened wood, taken off witli a heel and in- 
serted in sand under a bell-glass in bottom 
heat. 

Jasrninums, Rondeletias, Brunfelsias, &c, 
may also be propagated in a similar manner 
to the Ixoras. 

Lantanas. — Shift as requisite, and pro- 
pagate by cuttings ; water freely. 



I/uculia gratissima may now be removed 
to the conservatory to rest, previous to the 
production of its flowers. 

Lycopodivms do best under similar treat- 
ment with their near allies the ferns. 

Malvaceous plants, as hibiscus, must be 
copiously watered and syringed. The red 
spider is a terrible scourge to these plants, 
and should therefore be treated accordingly. 

Manettias, and other tender climbers, should 
be constantly trained to the desired forms, and 
may be freely watered ; shift as necessary. 

Melastomas. — Remove flowering plants to 
the conservatory, and water those advancing 
freely ; keep them in a warm part of the 
house. 

31elo- Cacti. — Keep them near the light, 
and water them freely as long as they show 
symptoms of growth. 

Musas. — Grow away by keeping them hot 
and giving an abundance of moisture, occa- 
sionally using manure water ; syringe often 
and keep the foliage very clean. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher plant). — Keep it in the 
hottest part of the house, and guard against 
its ever wanting water. 

Neriums. — Such as have made their growth 
may be exposed out of doors to ripen their 
wood ; lessen their supply of water. 

Nymph&as (Water Lilies). — Keep them 
near the light, and change the water about 
them so often that no scum or dirt may collect 
about the leaves or stalks. 

Palms. — Be particular that the roots are 
in a healthy state, and syringe often and copi- 
ously. 

Thunbergias. — Shift where necessary, and 
remove those in bloom to the conservatory ; 
syringe often ; they are very liable to suffer 
from attacks of the red spider. 

Vincas. — Those which have got straggling 
in habit, may be cut in, rested for a while, 
and then started by the application of in- 
creased heat and moisture to flower again. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm or Indian house 
from 85 to 90 degrees by day ; 70 degrees by 
night. The cool or Mexican house 75 to 80 
degrees by day ; 60 to 65 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Admit air as far as consistent 
with maintaining the required temperature, 
but avoid all draughts or rapid transitions. 

Watering — Apply moisture freely to grow- 
ing plants, but gradually withhold it from 
those which have completed their growth, 
and remove them to a dry part of the cool 
house. 

Insects. — Examine the growing plants care- 
fully, for their tender leaves, bulbs, and more 
especially their young roots, are favourite food 
for several insects as well as slu^s and snails. 



GAYLUSSACIA PSEUDO-VACCINIUM. 



309 



Potting. — Continue wherever requisite ; be 
careful not to use too much sphagnum or other 
moss about the roots or pseudo-bulbs. 

Shading. — Increase the thickness of this, if 
the sun is very bright and powerful, especially 
over the growing plants. 

Soils. — Collect various soils during the long 
fine days, and stack them up for use. 

Imported plants. — Water more freely as 
they advance in growth, and give them in- 
creased heat also. The best method of 
watering these, is to syringe them copiously. 

Aerides, Saccolabiwn, and Vanda. — Any 
of these that have completed their growth 
should be gradually removed to cooler quarters, 
where they will have more light and less water. 

JEschynanilius. — As these plants come into 



flower, remove them to a warm greenhouse, or 
a cool part of the orchid house, and keep them 
regularly watered. 

Cattleyas. — Pot such as show signs of 
growth, and place them in a hot, moist, and 
shady place. 

Cynibidiums. — Encourage as long as they 
continue to grow ; when they stop, rest them 
in a cooler house. 

Dendrob'mms. — Such as have made their 
growth should be exposed to powerful sun- 
light, and have very little water. 

Oncidiums. — Remove these to the coolest 
part of the house as they show signs of com- 
pleting their grow r th. 

Stanhopeas. — Treat as the last, giving very 
little water after they are at rest. 




GAYLUSSACIA PSEUDO-V ACCINIUM. 

(Chamisso.) 
BILBERRY-LLKE GAYLUSSACIA. 

Those who are at all familiar with plants j shrubs — chiefly evergreen ones — which in our 
will recognise in the engraving which accom- ' gardens bear the old-fashioned name of 
panies this notice, a near relation of those j Andromedas, or. at least are most familiarly

THE ANDROMEDA. 



known under that title ; for modern botanical 
science has assigned to many of them other 
titles, which are not very familiar with any 
but those who have a scientific knowledge of 
plants. Closely allied to this group is an- 
other, of which a familiar example is found in 
the common Bilberry ( Vaccinivm Myrtillus), 
which covers extensive tracts of waste land 
in various parts of our own country. A great 
many of the Vacciniums that are cultivated in 
gardens are, however, deciduous plants ; as 
also are some of those which formerly bore 
the name of Andromeda. It is with this 
latter group — that of Vacciniums — that the 
plant here represented is most closely related ; 
and we shall now direct our notice more 
exclusively to it. The relationship briefly 
sketched above, will be evident from the names 
the plant has borne, viz : — Andromeda cocci- 
nea, and Vaccinium brasiliense, given it by 
the olden writers. 

This species of Gaylussacia is an evergreen 
shrub, of spreading habit, growing from two 
to three feet high, clothed with fine glossy 
green oval leaves, an inch or rather more in 
length, and which give to the plant a very 
interesting appearance, even during the winter 
months when devoid of flowers. On the 
approach of summer, its flowers are produced, 
and these possess much beauty : they are 
what is termed pitcher-shaped, that is to say, 
cup-shaped, and contracted at the mouth, and 
their coluur is a most delicate and beautiful 
light rosy red. April, May, and June, are 
the particular months in which it is found to 
blossom ; and this it does not sparingly but 
profusely, for the branches throw out nume- 
rous axillary racemes, and these bear from 
eight to twelve flowers. There is a peculiar 
gracefulness in the distribution of these 
racemes ; they stand out laterally from the 
branches which support them, and being 
somewhat slender, the weight of the flowers 
gives them a graceful curve, and the flowers 
too are all turned as it were downwards, so 
that the flowers hang in a gracefully pendant 
curve. This arrangement of the flowers, so 
that they all point one way, is expressed by 
the botanical term secund. 



The plant is a native of Brazil, where it 
grows in open sandy plains. St. Hilaire, a 
Brazilian traveller, found it near the town of 
Caravellos, in the province of Porto Seguro, 
and extending along the coast as far as the 
island of Santa Catherina. The first recorded 
plants raised in England, were obtained by 
Messrs. Loddiges, of Hackney, who obtained 
the seeds from a friend residing in Brazil ; 
and from these seeds plants were raised about 
the year 1840. 

It is found to be a greenhouse plant, well 
adapted from its handsome glossy foliage, in 
company with other evergreens, for purposes 
of ornament and effect, even when it has no 
flowers upon it. Peat soil is most proper for 
it ; and it should have fibry turfy peat, con- 
taining a good sprinkling of particles of sand 
throughout its mass. To have fine plants, 
the roots must have the range of a consider- 
able bulk of healthy soil, but it is better not 
to put them into pots which look inconveni- 
ently large compared with the plants ; and in 
any case, the pots must be well drained, with 
a good layer of broken potsherds in the 
bottom, and some lumps of charcoal mixed 
among the soil, which is best used in great 
part in the form of small lumps, in preference 
to being too finely broken or sifted. While 
they are making their growth, they must have 
a liberal supply of water ; and, in fact, as 
with all other allied plants, they ought never 
to be allowed to get very dry. If this takes 
place during the period of growth, it will 
cause the young shoots to be small and 
stunted ; and if at any other period of the 
year, it will either cause the leaves to turn 
brown and unsightly, or cause them to fall 
off, in either case altogether spoiling the 
beauty of the plant. In other respects, it may* 
be treated in a similar manner to heaths and 
similar shrubby greenhouse plants. The most 
ready means of propagation is by layers, 
which should be put down just before the 
young shoots begin to form. 

.G-aylussacia belongs to the large natural 
group of Ericaceae, which comprises some of 
the most beautiful of all flowering shrubs, 
whether hardy or tender, native or exotic. 



THE ANDROMEDA. 



Under the title of Andromeda, a good many 
species of hardy Ericaceous shrubs were 
originally included ; these have been subse- 
quently separated by botanists into several 
genera, all of which are noticed below. 
The names of the genera ns divided are : — 
Andromeda, Cassiope, Cassandra, Zenobia, 
Lyonia, and Leucothoe : of course those 
who prefer the old names will call all of 



them Andromeda. They are all include 
in that class of subjects generally known a 
American plants. 

ANDROMEDA. 

The genus Andromeda, as now limited, 
contains but two species, of which there are 
several varieties. The name of Andromeda 
was applied by Linnaeus, under somewhat

interesting •circumstances: — Andromeda is 
known in mythology as the daughter of 
Cephalus, king of Ethiopia ; she was bound, 
quite exposed and naked, to a rock, that she 
might be devoured by a sea monster, to 
appease the wrath of Neptune, but was de- 
livered by Perseus, to Avhom she was after- 
wards married, and had many children. 
Linnaeus, in recording his discovery of the 
plant, gives the following reasons for ap- 
plying the name: — "Andromeda polifolia 
was now (June 12) in its highest beauty, 
decorating the marshy grounds in a most 
agreeable manner: the flowers are quite 
blood-red before they expand ; but when 
full grown the corolla is of a flesh colour : 
scarcely any painter's art can so happily 
imitate the beauty of a fine female complexion; 
still less could any artificial colour upon the 
face itself bear comparison with the lovely 
blossom. As I contemplated it, I could not 
help thinking of Andromeda, as described by 
the poets; and the more I meditated upon their 
descriptions, the more applicable they seemed 
to the little plant before me ; so that if these 
writers had it in view, they could scarcely 
have contrived a more apposite fable. Andro- 
meda is represented by them as a virgin of 
most exquisite and unrivalled charms ; but 
these charms remain in perfection only so long 
as she retains her virgin purity, which is also 
applicable to the plant now preparing to cele- 
brate its nuptials. The plant is always fixed 
on some little turfy hillock in the midst of the 
swamps, as Andromeda herself was chained 
to a rock in the sea, which bathed her feet, as 
the fresh water does the roots of this plant. 
Dragons and venemous serpents surrounded 
her, as toads and other reptiles frequent the 
abode of her vegetable resembler, and when 
they pair in the spring throw mud and water 
over its leaves and branches. As the distressed 
virgin casts down her blushing face through 
excessive affliction, so does this rosy coloured 
flower hang its head, growing paler and paler 
till it withers away. At length comes Perseus, 



in the shape of Summer, dries up the sur- 
rounding water and destroys the monsters, 
rendering the damsel a fruitful mother, who 
then carries her head erect." This incident 
shows that the mind of the great naturalist 
was not insensible of vivid and keen imagin- 
ation, even when apparently overwhelmed 
with severe studies. 

Andromedra polifolia, Linnasus (poly- 
leaved Andromeda, or Moorwort). — A low 
evergreen shrub, growing about a foot high; 
the leaves are oblong ; the flowers in small 
clusters at the tips of the shoots, ovate, 
pitcher-shaped, flesh-coloured, or pale red, 




blooming from May to September. A native 
of various parts of the north of Europe and 
North America. There are several varieties, as 
— angustifolia, with narrow leaves; ericoides, 
heath-like; grandiflora, with large flowers; la-> 
tifolia, with broad leaves; minima, with small 
flowers; revoluta, with the margins of the leaves 
bent back ; scotica, a Scotch variety ; and 
stricta, more erect in habit than the others. 
This plant has several common or vulgar 
names, as wild rosemary, poly-mountain, marsh 
holy rose, marsh cistus, moorwort, &c. 

Andromeda rosmarinifolia, Pujrsh (rose- 



312 



THE ANDROMEDA. 



mnry -leaved Andromeda). — An evergreen 
shrub, nearly like the preceding, but with 
linear-lanceolate leaves, having the margins 
turned back ; the flowers are nearly globose, 
white tinged with red ; it blooms in June. 
A native of Newfoundland and Labrador. 

These plants are propagated chiefly by 
layers, which root freely. They grow naturally 
in mossy bogs, and low wet places ; and under 
artificial cultivation they require to be grown 
in moist beds of peat soil, and in an open airy 
situation. Unless the situation be damp, or 
is rendered so artificially, it is difficult to keep 
the plants healthy for a length of time ; but 
where this condition is complied with, they 
grow freely, and are very interesting when in 
bloom. From their dwarf and compact habit 
they form very neat and pretty margins to 
beds of the larger growing American plants 
situated on a grass plot ; or they may be kept 
in beds of less size in company with some of the 
smaller growing plants of this order. 

CASSIOPE. 

Cassiope hypnoides, D. Don (hypnum- 
like Cassiope). — A small creeping shrub of 
evergreen habit, resembling some of the 
creeping-stemmed mosses ; it grows but two 
or three inches high : the leaves are loose, flat, 
and needle-like ; the flowers are drooping, 
small, bell-shaped, one terminating each stool, 
white with a red calyx ; they are produced 
in June and July. A native of the mountains 
of Lapland, Denmark, and Siberia, as well as 
the north-west coast of America. It is a plant 
of difficult cultivation. 

Cassiope tetragona, D. Don (four-cornered 
branched Cassiope). — A small evergreen creep- 
ing shrub, of similar habit to the preceding, 
with small obtuse leaves, closely imbricated 
into four rows, forming a four-cornered stem ; 
the flowers are white, more truly bell-shaped 
than the last, and produced from the sides of 
the branches, in March and April. It is a 
native of Lapland and Siberia in Europe, and 
of Canada, Labrador, and the north-west coast 
of America, and of the island of St. Lawrence. 
Difficult to cultivate. 

Cassiope lycopodioides, D. Don (club- 
moss-like Cassiope).— A diminutive evergreen 
moss-like creeping shrub, with ovate leaves, 
imbricated in four rows, and somewhat bell- 
shaped reddish flowers, produced in June and 
July. It is a native of Siberia and the island 
of St. Lawrence, but its date of introduction 
to this country is not known. 

Ca.-siope ericoides, D. Don (heath-like 
Cassiope). — A small creeping evergreen shrub, 
with erect branches, and very small leaves. 
A native of Dahuria and Kamtschatka. Neither 
the time of introduction nor its flowers are 
sufficiently well known. 



The Cassiopes are plants of much interest, 
chiefly owing to their small size, their neat 
forms, and above all, to their rarity, caused by 
the difficulty which attends their cultivation. 
Natives of some of the coldest and most 
rigidly inhospitable climes in the habitable 
world, they are destroyed by the comparatively 
genial character of our own climate; and while 
in England we need for the most part to form 
hot-houses for the growth of exotic vegetation, 
in this case it is the difficulty of keeping them 
sufficiently cool that has to be contended with. 
After all that can be done, the keen, rigid, 
bracing air of their native habitats cannot be 
imitated, especially in low sheltered situations, 
and therefore the plants never acquire their 
full perfection. We would suggest the fol- 
lowing course of treatment, founded on our 
knowledge and observation of the plants : — 
The soil should be turfy peat, of a sandy tex- 
ture, mixed with a few lumps of broken free- 
stone or charcoal, materials which from their 
porous nature tend to equalize the moisture of 
the soil — a point of much importance in their 
cultivation ; for, though they require a moist 
and cool medium for the roots, yet an excess 
of moisture would in this climate tend to 
render the soil unfit for their growth ; and 
dryness, which these lumps of porous material 
equally prevent, is fully as much or even more 
injurious. A cool, shaded, moist situation is 
essential for them, but it must at the same 
time be open as regards a free circulation of 
air. The plants once planted and established 
should not be very frequently removed, and 
the soil also ought not to be disturbed more 
than is absolutely necessary. The surface of 
the soil after planting may be covered with 
pebbles, or pieces of freestone, or both inter- 
mixed ; this, by tending to consolidate the 
soil, will preserve the roots more securely from 
any alternations of moisture, and the stones 
will attract and tend to convey it insensibly 
to the soil. In order to avoid the heat which 
such an arrangement would produce about the 
plant in summer, the whole surface might at 
that season be covered with compact tufts of 
green moss, which will greatly assist in keeping 
the w r hole cool and moist. When thus fully 
established in an open but somewhat shaded 
situation, in a locality which is found to suit 
them, nothing will be more beautiful during 
the spring months than the abundant pure 
white lily-of-the-valley-like flowers that will 
be produced. 

In some situations, where the air is peculiarly 
heavy and inappropriate for the growth of such 
delicate plants, we have seen them grown 
pretty well by placing over them a common 
hand-light, which is kept on closely during 
summer and winter. In such a position they 
are but little affected by the variations to 



THE ANDROMEDA.

which our climate is subject, and which are 
most trying to plants of this nature. From 
the small size which they attain, even when 
arrived at their ultimate size, and from the 
simple elegance and beauty of their blossoms, 
they seem peculiarly fitted for growing in a 
Wardian case : a small vase, filled entirely 
with these two plants, and covered by a bell- 
glass, would be a very pretty ornament, either 
for a table in a cool room, or for a shady win- 
dow; and in a cool case, in company with ferns 
of a hardy nature, placed in a shady situation, 
they would no doubt grow very freely. 

CASSANDRA. 

Cassandra calycidata, D. Don (calcu- 
lated Cassandra). — A small evergreen, or 
somewhat rusty looking shrub, growing two 
or three feet high, with curved spreading 
branches, and elliptic-oblong bluntish leaves, 
rusty beneath ; the flowers are white, oblong- 
cylindrical, thickly placed on the under side 
of the curving branches (in botanical language 
— racemes recurved, leafy) ; it blooms from 
February to April. A native of North America, 
also Sweden, Siberia, &c. The following va- 
rieties are enumerated : — angustifolia, with 
linear lanceolate leaves, and oblong ovate 
flowers ; latifolia, with broad leaves ; nana, 
a very dwarf small plant; and ventricosa, with 
the flowers much inflated. 

These plants are very ornamental, and re- 
quire the same kind of treatment as that 
recommended for Andromeda. 

ZENOBIA. 

Zenobia speciosa, D. Don (showy-flowered 
Zenobia).— A handsome evergreen shrub, grow- 
ing two or three feet high ; the leaves are 
oval, obtuse, crenated ; the flowers white, bell- 
shaped, disposed in numerous short drooping 
racemes along the branches, and blooming in 
June. A native of swamps in North Caro- 
lina. There is a variety called nitida, with 
oblong ovate serrated leaves ; another, pul- 
vendenta (also called Andromeda cassiiKefolia, 
speciosa, glauca, dealbata, and ovata), with 
roundish ovate crenated leaves, covered with 
white powder ; and spicata, with spiked 
flowers ; all these have white blossoms. 

The Zenobias are handsome plants, with 
good foliage, and require the same treatment 
as recommended for Andromeda. 

LYONIA. 

Lyonia arborea, D. Don (tree Lyonia). — 
A handsome small tree of twenty feet high 
and upwards ; the leaves are deciduous, ob- 
long-acuminate, serrated, and shining ; the 
flowers are white, ovoid-cylindrical, in ter- 



minal panicles, produced in June and July. 
A native of the valleys of the Alleghany 
Mountains in North America. The leaves 
have a pleasant acid taste, and are frequently 
used by hunters in the mountains to alle- 
viate thirst : it has been called the Sorrel 
tree. In a wild state it grows from forty to 
sixty feet high. 

Lyonia caprecefolia, "Watson (goat-willow- 
leaved Lyonia). — A deciduous small shrub, 
with coriaceous elliptic, serrulated leaves,

leaved Lyonia). — A small straggling evergreen 
shrub of two feet high, with oval-acuminate 
coriaceous leaves ; the flowers are cylindrical, 
pale red, blooming in June and July. A 
native of sandy forests in Carolina and 
Florida. A variety called rubra, has flowers 
of a deeper red. It is also called Andromeda 
coriacea, and A. Incida ; and by some A. 
mariana. 

Lyonia mariana, D. Don (Maryland 
Lyonia). — A deciduous shrub, growing two 
feet and upwards, with oval acute leaves, 
and large ovate-cylindrical flowers, white 
tinged with red ; they bloom from May to 
August. A native of woods and dry swamps 
in North America. A variety called oblonga 
has oblong leaves ; another, named ovalis, has 
oval leaves.

flowered Lyonia). — A deciduous shrub of 
three or four feet high, with obovate-lanceolate 
leaves, and small downy white globose flowers, 
in terminal panicled racemes ; it flowers in 
June and July. A native of swamps and 
woods in North America.

THE ANDROMEDA. 



Lyonia racemosa, D. Don (racemose- 
flowered Lyonia). — A deciduous shrub of 
three or four feet high ; the leaves are oval- j 
lanceolate, serrulate ; the flowers are cylin- 
drical, white, in terminal, one-sided spikes, 
having a very ornamental appearance ; it 
flowers in June and July. A native of bogs 
and swamps in North America. The flowers 
have a fine odour. There are two varieties : 
— latifolia and stricta. 

Lyonia rigida, Nuttal (rigid-leaved 
Lyonia). — An evergreen shrub, with cuneate- 
lanceolate coriaceous leaves ; the flowers are : 
globose, white, from the axils of the leaves ; I 
it flowers in April and May. A native of 
North America. 

Lyonia salicifolia, "Watson (willow-leaved 
Lyonia). — A deciduous shrub allied to L. 
'paniculata, and like it possessing considerable 
beauty ; the leaves are lanceolate-acuminate, 
shining ; the flowers are greenish-white glo- ; 
bular, in compound terminal racemes: it flowers 
in June and July. A native of the Mauritius. 

The Lyonias require similar treatment to 
that which will be detailed under the next head. 

LEUCOTHOE. 

Leucothoe acuminata, G. Don (acumi- 
nate-leaved Leucothoe). — An evergreen shrub 
of two to three feet high, with ovate-lanceolate 
shining coriaceous leaves ; the flowers are 
cylindrically ovate, white, in short drooping 
axillary racemes ; they are very freely pro- 
duced in July and August. A native of 
sandy swamps, in Georgia and Florida. It is | 
variously named : — Andromeda formosis- 
sima ; A. laurina ; A. reticulata; A. popu- 
lifolia; and A. lucida ; and is called '"'pipe 
stem-wood" by the Americans, from the 
circumstance of the stems being hollow, and 
used by them as pipe stems. 

Leucothoe axillaris, D. Don (axillary- 
racemed Leucothoe). — An evergreen shrub 
of two to three feet high, with oblong or oval, 
acuminate, serrulated leaves ; the flowers are . 
white, ovate-cylindrical, in short axillary 
racemes ; it blooms in May and June. A 
native of the mountains of North America. 
There is a variety with very long linear- 
lanceolate leaves. 

Leucothoe floribunda, D. Don (numerous- 
flowered Leucothoe). — An extremely beautiful 
evergreen shrub, growing two or three feet 
high, and very bushy ; the leaves are coria- 
ceous, ovate-acute, finely serrulated ; the 
flowers are white, ovate, disposed in several 
close one-sided spikes at the ends of the 
branches, forming a terminal forked panicle ; 
it blooms in May and June. A native of the 
mountains of Georgia. This plant is rare, j 
and generally esteemed difficult of cultivation, j 



Leucothoe spicata, G. Don (spicate-ra- 
cemed Leucothoe). — A glabrous evergreen 
shrub of two feet high., with elliptic-lanceolate, 
serrated leaves, and long one-sided spikes of 
cylindrical-ovate white flowers ; produced in 
June. A native of North America. 

Leucothoe spinulosa, G. Don (spinulous- 
leaved Leucothoe). — An evergreen shining 
low shrub, with coriaceous ovate-oblong, 
serrulated leaves, and white ovate-cylindrical 
flowers, in one-sided axillary racemes ; it 
blooms in May and June. A native of Lower 
Carolina. It is also known as Andromeda 
Catesb&i, and is a very beautiful species. 

L. floribunda, which is oae of the most 
beautiful, is also generally considered one of 
the most difficult species to cultivate. The 
following details refer specially to it, but the 
same system of cultivation will be found suit- 
able for the whole family of Andromedae. 

This species of Leucothoe pre-eminently 
delights in the cool moist situation which has 
already been alluded to. It is very impatient 
of heat and a dry atmosphere ; when planted, 
as it has sometimes been seen, in a border on 
the south side of a brick wall — a situation 
usually afforded to rare and delicate plants, 
and where, therefore, this would be very likely 
to be placed — it soon gets into a very un- 
healthy state, and eventually languishes and 
perishes. It is also impatient of being kept 
in a pot, though it may be taken up and placed 
in pots for forcing one season without much 
injury being sustained ; in this case it requires 
planting out again, after flowering. But when 
retained during the summer in pots, it always 
suffers, more or less ; and no treatment appears 
so prejudicial to its health as to be potted and 
placed in a dry and hot situation, exposed to 
the rays of the sun, or within the influence of 
reflected heat. In thus alluding to its inadap- 
tation to pot culture, it is not assumed that it 
cannot be well grown in pots, for the skill and 
energy of British gardeners would accomplish 
even greater deeds than this, but in ordinary 
cases, and under ordinary treatment, it does 
not succeed when so grown. In fact, its 
proper position is out-of-doors, as a hardy 
shrub ; and there through the winter and 
early spring its pearly flowers and dark green 
foliage are very beautiful. 

To secure the condition of coolness and 
moisture in the soil, so desirable in cultivating 
these plants, and not always naturally existing, 
at least when the necessary drainage to prevent 
stagnant moisture has been attended to, the 
following practice has been adopted with 
success : — Beneath the soil forming the beds 
in which they are grown, is formed an imper- 
vious layer of stiff or clayey soil, hollowed out 
like a dish ; this should slightly slope to one 
point, where there should be egress for the 



NOTES ON FLORISTS JFLOWERS. 



315 



water when necessary ; the bottom of this bed 
is then laid with six or eight inches of open 
material, among which water may be absorbed 
in passing downwards after watering the sur- 
face, or when poured beneath the soil, at 
places formed on purpose; the object is, in 
dry weather in summer to keep this open 
material thoroughly moist, and this keeps the 
roots cool ; moisture may be retained for any 
length of time in the bottom of the bed, by 
stopping up the point of egress, which may be 
made in the form of a simple sluice. In 
winter or in wet weather at any period of the 
year, when the artificially induced moisture 
was not required, the point of egress might 
be free for the passage away of the water from 
the bed, which in this case would not differ 
from an ordinary bed of earth. The thickness 
of the peat soil for the roots may be from 
fifteen to eighteen inches. In this, the plants 
will be found to grow freely enough in an 
open and exposed situation, without requiring 
shelter of any kind. 

It may be well to mention, that where a 
number of these plants are seen growing toge- 
ther, an occasional branch or two maybe seen 
gradually drying up and eventually perishing ; 
this is found to have been caused by some 
injury sustained by the bark during the pro- 
cess of hoeing or weeding the ground, by some 
careless hand. The injury of the bark there- 
fore from this or any other means, ought to 
be carefully avoided. 

It is propagated readily by layers, which 
take two seasons to root. They are best put 
down in the month of April, because the spring 
is the best time to remove them when rooted, 
and they ought to be taken off and transplanted 
as early as they are ready to be detached, for 
if allowed to remain they grow rapidly and 
become crowded, which is injurious to that 
bushy and well furnished habit so much to be 
desired in the young plants. 

In planting, both in the case of these and 
other groups of Andromeda, it has too often 
happened that they are planted much too 
closely together^ by which their natural habits 
and characters are totally lost, and their 
blooming greatly hindered ; they ought in all 
cases to be placed so as to grow quite apart 
from, and independently of, each other. 



Allusion has been made to forcing this shrub. 
Its flowers are formed along with the young 
shoots during summer, and even out of doors 
continue to advance slowly all through the 
winter up to the time of flowering in the 
spring ; their maturity may be accelerated 
by taking up the plants carefully in the early 
part of October, and potting them in pots 
suitable to their size, and in peat soil ; they 
should then be placed in a situation where 
they will be protected not only from wet but 
from extreme cold — not that they require pro- 
tection from severe weather, for they are per- 
fectly hardy, but the protection thus afforded 
to them is the first advance in the progressive 
increase of temperature, by which alone perfect 
success in forcing hardy plants into bloom is 
to be realized. When submitted to this mode- 
rately increasing temperature they will be in 
flower in a month or six weeks, according to 
the particular period of the winter, and the 
presence or absence of sun. "When in bloom 
they can be taken to the drawing room, or 
conservatory. After the blooms are faded, 
they must be again sheltered by a frame till 
about the month of April, when they should 
be planted out, and other plants must be 
selected at the proper season for forcing the 
following year. In planting out, the tips of 
the fibrous roots should be carefully disengaged 
from the balls of earth, and laid out on the 
soil. Some plants of this shrub in the garden 
of the Royal Botanic Society in the Regent's 
Park, which were taken off' as rooted layers 
in the spring of 1837, were in 1844 about 
three feet high, and thirteen feet in circum- 
ference, closely and evenly furnished with 
branches, and with flowers in the blooming 
season, and at that period resembling a huge 
mass of pearls thickly studded over the dark 
green leaves. 

The remarks here given on the treatment 
of this plant will apply equally to the Lyonias ; 
and also more or less to the Cassandras, Zeno- 
bias, and Andromedas. The species enume- 
rated in this paper may be considered as 
Andromedas, or the name we have given may 
be adopted if preferred. 

In the case of most of the species here re- 
ferred to, the flowers are of a delicate waxy 
texture, and admirably adapted for bouquets.

BT GEOKGE GLENNY. 



The present season has not been very pro- 
lific in the way of novelties. A few specimens 
of flowers exhibited up to this time at the 
Metropolitan Shows may be worth notice, 
and only a few. Tulips afford but little, nor 
is there any subject that requires an elaborate 
notice. Two tulips that were let out last 



year are deserving mention — The Queen of 
the North, by Mr. Hepworth, and Bijou, by 
Mr. Dickson, — the former was described by 
us while it was a seedling in the first holder's 
hands. It is a compact but unwilling opener, 
with rather a long cup, very close, splendid 
white ground pure as snow, a dark feathering,

generally well marked, but this is not likely 
at such a season as the present ; nevertheless, 
we have seen it perfect ; the feathering not 
the eighth of an inch down, the white as pure 
as snow, and scarcely a break all round the 
feather. It is decidedly an acquisition in a 
fine bed, and the sooner it is general the 
better. Bijou is a very striking rose, let out 
by John Dickson last autumn, and worthy of 
a place in any collection, however fine. It is 
very distinct, between the colour of Triumph 
Royal and that of Princess Sophia of Glou- 
cester, or Madame Vestris. It is quite dis- 
tinct enough to put into a stand with any rose 
extant, and we consider it a great acquisition. 
This year Cooper's flowers have been distri- 
buted, and among them were four or five of 
his own raising or breaking. His President is 
a Bizarre, stands in good condition in his 
outbed, but heavy in the general way : it is 
remarkably clean. His King of Oude, about 
which some florists said a good deal as a 
middle row flower, in the inside is worse 
than we know how to describe. It must be 
grown in the middle of a six feet wide clump, 
so that nobody can ever see the inside. 
Cooper's rose Fanny has been so heavy in 
colour as to be unfit to judge. All that we 
can say of it is, that it is clean, and when in 
good marking must be a pretty flower. Louis 
Philippe is a clear Byblomen, not a bad shape, 
but it rather hugs like Belle Ceres, and 
Maid of Athens, or Thalia. The tulip sales 
this year have exhibited something like a fall 
in prices, chiefly, however, through the want 
of money, and not a lack of buyers : the 
most showy and expensive of the season 
being Dickson's Duke of Devonshire, Pompe 
funebre, Lac, Bysantium, Strong's King, 
Jeffrey's Elizabeth, and one or two others ; 
but money has been considered, in comparison 
with all articles of luxury, to be twice as 
valuable as it was last year, consequently 
nobody would part with so much of it. 
Auriculas have not produced any great things. 
Mr. Dickson has exhibited a new one, which 
seemed to be a favourite, and one or two 
country flowers have exhibited some marks of 
promise, but nothing distinct enough to pro- 
nounce good has been seen this season. 
Geraniums have certainly made no decided 
advance in the first three or four shows that 
they have appeared at. Ordinary colours, 
and not better than recent ordinary forms, 
have abounded without any striking feature. 
Some three or four half-bloomed things have 
been seen, and they may, at future shows, 
redeem their character, or rather assume their 
character. Some of them appeared to have 
been placed in head to force out a flower, and 
we need not say that such flowers were not 
in their proper character. In Pansys, Mr. 



Turner has shown one of some promise. Mr. 
Bragg has produced a bright lively looking 
yellow ground flower, which he has named 
Mrs. Bragg. Mr. Hunt, of Bucks, has shown 
a flower called the Honourable Mr. Grey, 
which was in bad condition, but had a mag- 
nificent bottom petal, almost the best we ever 
saw; whether some ugly folds in the upper 
petals will come out or not, we have yet to 
see; the upper part of the flower is not equal 
to the bottom. Cinerarias have made a 
decided advance. Mr. Ivery is proving some 
that we fully expect to be able to recommend 
strongly for their excellent properties in ano- 
ther month. They show a disposition to lose 
the notch, and to close up in a very good 
circle. The colours, too, of several are very 
desirable, and, upon the whole, we think 
there will be six or eight fit to add to any 
collection. Petunias are in request. Girling's 
Madame Celeste, Miss Ellen Chaplin, and a 
third that we do not know the name of, are 
great acquisitions. Lucy Neal, however, is the 
very best we have seen, and we would strongly 
recommend everybody who has not got it to 
procure it : we consider it the best form of any, 
if not the best in one or two other points. 

The Royal Botanic Society has been 
liberal with prizes for florists' flowers, and it 
has had the best effect, because they form the 
most attractive features in a show. We shall 
be able to give a few names and descriptions 
of geraniums next month ; but hitherto we 
have seen nothing to warrant any very great 
notice ; the truth is, some of Mr. Beck's 
flowers are so fairly a-head, that seedlings, 
which might have been stars once, are eclipsed 
now, and so it is with some other flowers of 
scarcely less importance. — G.G. 

IMPROVEMENT IN "WATERING CANS. 
Mr. Saul, of Garstang, has suggested an im- 
provement in the construction of the common 
garden watering can, which consists in fixing a 
plate pierced with holes inside the can at the 
lower end of the spout, by which means any 
matters which may be contained in the water 
are prevented from entering the spout, and 
obstructing the discharge of the water through 
the rose fixed at the upper end. This is often 
a source of great annoyance in the operation 
of watering when the rose is made use of, the 
roses being constantly liable to become choked 
or stopped up by extraneous matters which 
may get into the water. "Watering cans of 
this construction would also be suitable for 
applying liquid manure. The addition is 
very easily made, and is, of course, effectual 
in preventing the inconvenience in question. 
Of course, in the case of watering cans that 
are constantly used without the rose on the 
spout, the addition is not required.

GLENNY ON THE FUCHSIA, 

ITS CULTURE AND PROPERTIES. 



The Fuchsia has become one of the most 
popular of the florists' plants. The publication 
of the properties which constitute perfection 
was the signal for a general improvement ; 
and notwithstanding the thousands of weedy 
worthless things that have been turned out 
without merit to sustain them a season, there 
has been a general appreciation of the better 
subjects, so that it is now possible to obtain 
a dozen or more varieties which are manifest 
approaches to the desirable standard. The 
Fuchsia, more than any other subject, derives 
much of its value from the habit of the plant. 
Many of the varieties have flowers worthy of 
notice, but the uncouth growth of the shrub 
itself destroys its beauty; while some of the 
most handsome of the plants have ugly flowers. 
There is much to be done in cultivation to 



aid their appearance, and care should always 
be taken to shape the specimen under culture 
in such a way as to show off the habit to ad- 
vantage: for instance, if the flowers or the 
footstalks of the flowers be very long, the 
plant must be grown sufficiently open to allow 
the bloom to hang free of the branches, and 
in some instances they would be better as 
standards. In the cultivation, therefore, of 
the plant this must be well studied. The 
various modes of growing the Fuchsia consist 
of retarding the open lanky varieties, exciting 
the short-jointed bushy kinds, thinning out 
those which have the branches confused, and 
shortening the branches of all inclined to grow 
too long ; and these operations are simple 
enough when once it is understood what the 
plant requires. 



318 



THE FUCHSIA. 



FUCHSIA FULGENS AND COKYMBIFLORA. 

The varieties of this kind — and they are 
many — are curious in habit as well as in 
flower. The bloom comes in bunches almost 
like tassels at the ends of the branches ; the 
choice therefore may be made as to forming 
a bush or a standard tree, for they do for 
either. 

To form the Standard, — The strongest 
shoot that comes from the root in spring must 
be allowed to grow, and all others must be 
cut off as they appear, so that the plant must 
be confined to one stem. The plant should 
always be repotted as soon as it begins to 
grow, gi _ ing a good inch of new soil all round 
the old ball ; even if the plant be young and 
in a two-and-a-half-inch pot, it ought to be 
placed in a four-and-a-half-inch sized one. 
As it advances in height the lower side shoots 
should be taken off, but three or four pair 
should be always kept on ; and as the upper 
ones advance the lower ones can be taken 
away, so long as it grows the height the stem 
is required to be. When the stem has grown 
as high as it is required, and you wish to form 
the head, pinch out the top, and it will acce- 
lerate the growth of the side branches required 
for it ; and the end must be pinched out of 
the side shoots, that they may throw out 
laterals, and such of these as are wanted may 
be allowed to grow, while those which cross 
each other, or cause any confusion, may be 
removed altogether. The stem must be kept 
clear by rubbing off all the little shoots that 
appear as soon as they come ; and as a general 
rule from the beginning, change the pots to 
larger ones as soon as the roots begin to mat 
round the side, which will be guessed at 
pretty well : before a change is made, the ball 
of earth of each plant must be examined, and 
if the roots have not matted a little, it may be 
continued some time longer. The formation 
of the head must be well attended to, and 
when there appears to be branches enough, 
they must be no longer stopped, but allowed 
to continue growing up to the bloom, which, 
coming as it does at all the ends of the some- 
what pendent branches and shoots, hangs down 
in rich clusters, and has a very pretty ap- 
pearance. 

To form the Shrub. — The plant should 
be. as in the former case, confined to one 
shoot, and all the others should be removed. 
Observe the same plan in potting, but remove 
none of the lateral branches as the plant ad- 
vances, because in this case you want the plant 
to be feathered down to the pot, or nearly so. 
If any one of the side branches appears more 
vigorous than the rest, stop it ; but as the 
plant naturally prows bushy, the chief object 
is to regulate the branches, and to cut them 



away when they come too thick. When the 
plant is nearly as tall as you want it, pinch 
the ends out of every branch, and if necessary 
shorten them two or three joints ; you then 
depend on all the laterals for growth and 
bloom, and you will have a bushy handsome 
shrub, with bunches of flowers, much more 
numerous than they would be without the 
stopping, but not so large as if you allowed 
the original branches to flower. 

THE GLOBOSA AND SHRUBBY KINDS. 

These will in general grow handsome, but 
there are more woody than the varieties we 
have been treating of. They will grow from 
year to year, and retain the old wood, so that 
a standard once formed may be preserved and 
grown like arose; but the plants, when young, 
must be grown into the form required, and as 
they bloom all along the branches, they must 
never be allowed to grow too thick. Many of 
the varieties disposed like the globosa to be 
pendulous and very bushy, require nothing 
but growing, and the occasional removal of 
branches growing in the way of each other ; 
and this must be well attended to, for half the 
beauty of the plant is destroyed when they 
are allowed to grow at random. There is a 
peculiarity in some of the varieties — and 
globosa is among these — which must be taken 
into account while growing ; this peculiarity 
is the habit of blooming even the instant they 
are struck. Mr. Dennis, of the King's-road, 
used to exhibit plants by scores in full bloom, 
hanging over all round the pot, and not two 
inches high, and very beautiful looking objects 
they were ; when this is required we have 
only to select the cuttings from the ends of 
branches, at the fall of the year, strike them 
in heat, and pot them as soon as they have 
struck in small sixties, or pots of two and a half 
inches across, in soil composed of loam from 
rotted turf, two parts, and cow dung decom- 
posed to mould, one part : let this be sifted 
with a sieve that would let horse beans through, 
merely to take away larger stones, which are in 
the way in small pots, though not in large ones. 
In these pots let them grow all the winter, instead 
of resting, but pinch out the tops as soon as they 
start, and in spring they will be handsome 
little plants in full flower, m But plants that 
are to be grown to any size as specimens must 
be put into a moderate degree of warmth, 
and even a little bottom heat is good for them: 
they must not be topped, but as soon as the 
roots reach the side they must be shifted to 
larger pots, and the instant the buds appear 
they must be picked off; but, generally 
speaking, all the plants of this short pendulous 
bushy habit may be allowed to grow and 
bloom and grow again, merely shifting them 
as they require it to larger sized pots, and 



THE FUCHSIA. 



310 



resting during the winter months in a cold pit 
or greenhouse. 

THE TALL GROWING KINDS. 

If any thing ever showed the folly of the 
one shift system its application to Fuchsias 
was that one thing. In the varieties, like 
Venus Victrix, and many more, rapid growth 
is detrimental to beauty. They should be 
grown in the loam from rotted turf only ; they 
require no excitement ; the cuttings when 
struck should be potted as directed for the 
globosa, the change of soil only excepted ; the 
cutting should be topped, so as to leave only 
two joints above the soil, and one of these 
should be close down to the compost. As the 
laterals grow, pinch the tops off, and this will 
induce other laterals from the first shoots ; by 
avoiding dung in the compost, and not giving 
much room in the pots, and allowing but a 
limited supply of water, these plants will grow 
shorter jointed; and by continual watchful- 
ness and stopping all the shoots at the third 
joints, and merely removing altogether such 
shoots as are in the way, fine bushy growth can 
be maintained, even in the most ugly kinds. 
When the plant has grown enough to promise 
a handsome finishing growth, let the shoots 
all grow but such as are in the way of each 
other ; and though it may not be half so large 
a plant as might be grown under other manage- 
ment, it will be found uniformly more beauti- 
ful. It may be allowed to go on to flower, and 
will repay well for the additional trouble. 

In a general way the Fuchsia luxuriates 
in rich soil, but nineteen of every twenty 
plants that are exhibited are thoroughly 
spoiled by the rank growth. The great 
straggling specimens that have been shown as 
examples of one season's growth have been 
enough to disgust a man of taste; for rapid 
growth is always against appearances, and 
the very feature which is shown as a specimen 
of skill in culture is evidence of a total miscon- 
ception of what the plant ought to be, and of a 
coarse or vitiated taste that has done much to 
retard floriculture — a vulgar notion that size is 
a quality tobe appreciated before beauty. There 
is nothing moi'e easy than to grow a fuchsia 
of a large size. It may, for the sake of occu- 
pying less room, be potted from a cutting to 
a two and a half inch pot, and placed in a 
moderate stove or warm greenhouse, so as to get 
a gentle bottom heat; a common cucumber bed 
that is declining would do for some time. 
The instant the roots of the plant reach the 
side of the pot, shift it into a larger sized one, 
and repeat the treatment : as it will grow 
rapidly, change it to a pot a size larger the 
instant the roots reach the side, and continue 
its growth. Should it show bloom before its 
time, pick eve:ybud off as soon as it appears; 



but by continuing the rapid growth the flower 
very seldom troubles us. In this way the 
advantage over the one shift system — which 
means planting the cutting at once into the 
largest sized pot — is, that the plants do not 
occupy so much room until they have attained 
their maturity : but the roots must not be 
allowed to matt against the side ; the shift 
must take place as soon as the roots reach, and 
before it makes any growth upon the surface 
of the pot ; for all that can be done for a plant 
wanted to grow rapidly is to see that it has 
no check by reason of a want of nourishing 
material for it to grow in. In addition to this 
some use liquid manure ; but when the pot is 
changed before the roots matt together, and 
the compost is rich, there is no need of any 
thing more exciting. The plants so grown 
will, however, only be like those shown so ugly 
at the principal shows ; there will be nothing 
elegant about them ; the joints will be further 
apart, consequently the foliage will be poorer, 
and the plants much more straggling than they 
ought to be. 

STRIKING CUTTINGS. 

There is not a weed that strikes more freely 
than the fuchsia. It has been the custom to 
cut up the pieces, so as to have a joint at the 
bottom, and one above the surface, and in this 
way they may be struck by thousands under 
a common hand-glass in a shady border ; but 
as a rule without an exception, slight bottom 
heat will always hasten the striking of cuttings, 
no matter what they are ; and, perhaps, if 
there are many thousand cuttings to strike, it 
would be worth making a slight hot-bed in a 
shady corner, or where there is a facility for 
shading, and to put about three inches of good 
sandy compost upon it ; then with hand-glasses 
mark the spaces to be occupied ; into these 
spaces place the cuttings very thick, and cover 
with the glass after watering. This may be 
done in the spring or fall of the year. The 
glasses must be frequently lifted to give air, 
but never left off, unless it were in case of a 
warm evening or morning, when there is a 
gentle shower. In ordinary collections a few 
cuttings may be placed in a pot under a bell 
glass, and put into a frame or in the green- 
house, and they will strike like so much couch 
grass : in short, so that the cuttings are placed 
in some sort of compost, watered in, and 
shaded, it would be difficult to prevent them 
from striking. 

SAVING SEED. 

The Fuchsia seeds freely enough when in 
good health and brought into bloom early ; but 
the desire to grow new varieties may induce 
the cultivator to fertilize them artificially, 
instead of allowing them to take their chance. 
There is no flower more easily fertilized, 



320 



THE FUCHSIA. 



because the pistil is very much exposed, and 
the pollen is easily got at. Select for seed- 
bearing, plants of good habit, and with flowers 
which have some good properties ; those which 
are to supply the pollen may be selected for 
some particular quality, as colour, shape, or 
whatever else may be wanting to make the 
others better. When Fuchsia fulgens first 
got about, everybody was seeding from it, and 
those who pretended to cross or fertilize at all 
used the smaller varieties for the purpose : 
the result was, that almost all the novelties 
were of the coarse ugly habit of fulgens, and 
the flower in general worse instead of better 
than the parent. "We advised in early days 
to save seed from the globosa varieties fer- 
tilized with the pollen of the fulgens, if large 
flowers were wished for. In all cases, as the 
parent or seed-bearing plant is sure to pre- 
dominate, so far as habit goes, in all the 
seedlings, it should be invariably a handsome 
growing variety. Having selected the plant 
to seed from, take the pollen from any one 
whose colour or texture you wish to impart, 
and with this pollen cover the pistil as soon 
as it becomes glutinous, and before its own 
pollen falls upon it : tie a piece of matting or 
other slight thing to mark the flower you have 
fertilized, and remove all the other flowers and 
buds of flowers directly you observe the 
pod swells; this will hasten the growth and 
perfecting of the seed. When the pod has 
ripened it will be soft and full of pulp, which 
holds the seed, and this may be kept until it 
begins to shrivel or turn mouldy, when the 
seed should be taken from the pulp, and care- 
fully dried before it is put away. 

RAISING THE SEEDLINGS. 

In a wide-mouthed pot — which is preferable 
to a seed pan, on account of the body of mould 
to retain the necessary moisture — sow the seed 
very thinly in compost of nearly all rotted 
turfs, with a little sand, if necessary, to lighten 
it ; sift a little of this through a fine sieve to 
cover the seeds, and place it in the greenhouse 
under a hand-glass. Any time from January 
to May will do, but the sooner the better. 
As soon as the seed begins to vegetate, it may 
be taken into the propagating house or a warm 
part of the greenhouse ; and when the plants 
are large enough to handle, prick them out an 
inch apart in wide-mouthed pots, and let them 
be covered with a glass for a few days until 
they fairly establish themselves. They may 
now be placed in the greenhouse without 
covering, and be allowed to grow until they 
nearly touch each other, and may then be 
potted in sixty-sized pots, one in each, and if 
you have frame room out of doors, they should 
be placed on a hard bottom and be covered with 
the glasses at night, and in foul weather ; 



here they may remain, watered at proper 
seasons, and having all the air that can be 
given, until the roots fill the pots, when they 
may be all shifted into five-inch pots, and stood 
out of doors altogether. Great care must be 
taken that they are regularly watered, and 
that they stand on a hard bottom, that they 
may not strike their roots through the pots 
into the ground, for that creates an excited 
growth, and the plants suffer when removed. 
The great object in growing seedlings without 
attempting to top them or stop the branches, 
is that we may see their natural growth, for 
there is as much value in habit as in flower ; 
and a bad habit with a fine bloom should only 
be tolerated until as good a flower can be got 
on a fine habit. As the winter approaches, the 
pots should be removed into a cold frame, and 
with a hard bottom ; they do not require heat, 
but they must be covered from frost ; they 
will in all probability lose their leaves, and 
they should not be watered — not that they 
will do without some moisture, but while there 
is any, they ought not to be watered more than 
just to keep them alive. Towards the spring 
they will indicate growth by the swelling of 
the buds ; the balls may be turned out and 
examined, and if the pots are full of roots, 
change them all for thirty-two-sized pots ; give 
them only the loam of rotted turfs ; if this 
cannot be had, and you have only plain loam, 
add one part of leaf mould to every two parts 
of the loam ; and if the loam be rather poor 
than otherwise, make three parts loam, one 
part leaf mould, and one part cow dung, or 
dung from a melon bed rotted into mould. 
In these pots they may be set to grow in a 
greenhouse, for when they begin to grow they 
would be very easily damaged by a slight 
frost, that is to say, the young growth would 
be cut off, so that the growth afterwards would 
not be natural ; the effect would be the same 
as topping all the ends, which, however desi- 
rable in some plants, cannot be so with seed- 
lings, which you require to exhibit their 
natural growth. As they bloom, throw away 
or give away all that are not improvements 
on what we have already, or sufficiently novel 
and good to be worth cultivation ; no self 
ought to be retained unless it be very remark- 
able ; no coarse large sorts should be kept 
unless the corolla be very distinct, and the 
plant of very fine habit. Many may be tole- 
rated for their colour, some for their contrast, 
but none would in thesejdays be considered at 
all fine unless they showed the inside of the 
sepal, which is always the best surface, and all 
the corolla, which is the great ornament of the 
flower. Early in June they may be placed 
in the open air, and have all the sun and rain, 
but as the roots next the side of the pot are 
soon scorched unless the plants are liberally 



THE FUCHSIA.

watered, nothing is more necessary than atten- 
tion to that point. The object of growing 
them out of doors is to get them of their natural 
colour ; house culture will often blanch the 
sepals that would otherwise be red, or foxy ; 
and it is quite necessary to see what they 
would be without this blanching. Such as 
are worth taking care of may be removed into 
the greenhouse or conservatory ; and may, if 
increase be desired, be propagated immediately 
by cuttings, as we have already directed. 

FLOWERING THE FUCHSIA. 

Here proper regard must be paid to the 
habit. If the blooms are scanty along the 
branch, but very thick at the ends or towards 
the ends, the buds should be thinned out, so 
as not to touch each other or be crowded. The 
thinning of the flowers will make those which 
are left finer, and come to perfection more 
evenly ; nothing is more common than to see 
the buds which are left clustering towards the 
end remain green, while those near the bottom 
bloom and decay. It is a decided fault if the 
flowers do not come out pretty nearly toge- 
ther. 

FUCHSIAS IN BEDS OR BORDERS. 

In planting beds or borders there is room 
for a little taste. The outer row should be 
very dwarf; those next to them inwards 
should be taller, and of another colour if 
possible ; and the further they get from the 
edge, the taller should the natural height of 
the variety be. When bedded out they ought 
all to be small, well established in pots, but 
not grown much. The tallest growing sorts 
should be at the back of a border, or in the 
centre if it be in a bed. There are some that 
will run up conical and several feet high ; and 
regard must always be had to the height they 
attain. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The Fuchsia is a very sporting flower, but 
like many others there is a great sameness in 
a batch of seedlings ; and it is not enough to 
pick out those which differ but little from our 
present varieties, or from each other, for that 
has been the great evil. Many hundreds that 
have been catalogued are positively worthless, 
and were so from the first. It must be a very 
remarkable one that is worth saving now, 
without it reflexes ; the difference between 
one which does and one which does not reflex, 
may be seen from our engravings. The one 
shows the outside of the petals, which is almost 
invariably coarser and duller than the inside, 
besides which it covers instead of exposes the 
corolla, which is the chief beauty ; and unless 
the sepals and the corolla are of decidedly 
48. 



different colours, so as to form a contrast, they 
are scarcely worth keeping. 

MONTHLY TREATMENT. 

January. — All the plants are now resting, 
and must have no water ; they may be placed 
on the ground in the greenhouse, or be in 
cold frames and pits. A little seed may be 
sown this month or next. 

February. — The plants now indicate 
growth by the swelling of the eyes, and in 
some instances the actual bursting of them ; 
they should, therefore, be pruned, repotted, 
and set to work. In pruning plants which 
have grown to any size, regard must be had 
to the shape you wish the plants to assume ; 
all the weak spindly twigs must be removed, 
for they can be of no use, but, on the contrary, 
they would make a confusion : generally all 
weak ends should be taken off and shortened 
to the stronger wood. Seed may be sown 
this month. Seedlings of last year should not 
be pruned at all, however ugly they may be. 

March. — Towards the end of this month 
the plants should be turned out, and the balls 
examined to see if the roots are beginning to 
matt next the pot : if they be, there should 
be another change to a larger sized pot : if 
they have not begun to matt round the side of 
the pot, they may remain till they do. Any 
of the branches that are growing out of the 
form you wish, may be shortened ; branches 
growing across each other, must be altered by 
shortening one, or taking it away altogether. 
Seed sown in February and March must be 
kept moist, and covered with glass, indepen- 
dently of being in a greenhouse or pit. The 
prunings of the plants may be used as cuttings, 
if wanted. 

April. — The plants now grow fast, and 
must be attended to, according to the shape 
they are to grow. Of the necessary training 
and pruning enough has been said, but you 
cannot carry out the directions too strictly. 
If the plant seems sufficiently well-shaped, 
and indicates a graceful growth, it may go on, 
but if it be not full enough, the shoots must 
be all topped, or at least such of them as are in 
places where the plant or the head of the plant 
wants to be thickened. Seeds that are well 
up, and the plants large enough to handle, 
must be pricked out an inch apart from each 
other, in pots of any size, because the number 
in each will depend on this only. The best 
way to prick them out is, to begin round the 
edge with the first circle, the plants touching 
the pot ; a circle one inch within should be 
next filled ; and then another circle within 
the second, and so on till the pot is filled. 
Examine the growing plants, to see if they 
require larger pots : watering must be well 
attended to. 

Y

THE FUCHSIA. 



Mat. — The treatment should be the same 
as last mouth, in almost every respect. "While 
growing, the plants want great attention as to 
"watering, and giving them plenty of air, for 
they will otherwise draw up weakly. If they 
could in cloudy weather he quite open to the 
air, so much the better. The seedlings must 
be watered, and may be supplied with as much 
air as possible ; they should be as near the 
glass as you can put them. 

June. — In this month many plants will 
begin to flower, and in a collection they may 
be better to come at different times, than all 
at once. If you intend them for late show, 
they must be kept cool and very airy, and 
completely shaded from the sun ; but the ma- 
terial must be light, for if they are darkened, 
they cannot bloom so finely, and the foliage is 
apt to turn pale. Such as are not showing 
bloom buds, or, if showing, are required to 
bloom soon, may be continued with all the 
benefit of the sun, and in the natural warmth 
of the house. Seedlings will be growing fast, 
and the balls may be examined towards the 
end of the month, to see if the roots are too 
thick in the pots ; if they should be, the plants 
may be removed into small sized sixty-pots, 
say those of 2\ to 3 inches across the top, one 
in each pot ; they may be well watered to 
settle the earth about the roots, and replaced 
until they are established, after which they 
may be set out of doors, and allowed to receive 
all the weather ; but the bottom on which 
they stand must be bard, and not retain wet, 
nor admit roots. Pay great attention to the 
watering in the house, in the pits, and the 
open air, — but especially the open air, because 
the sun has great power, and soon dries up the 
moisture of small pots. You must be guided 
by the state of the soil, and not merely do it 
periodically. Thin the bloom buds where 
they are too thick, for the flowers should never 
crowd. Look to the seedlings of last year, 
and save only such as show good properties. 

July. — The season of blooming having 
fairly set in, all that can be done for the 
appearance of the plants should be done, such 
as taking off any branches that appear super- 
fluous, and increasing the size of the pots if 
neces.viry, but this must be done carefully if 
at all. The seedlings may, by the end of the 
month, have filled their pots with roots, and 
if so, they must be changed from the sixty- 
size to the forty-eight size ; and if this be 
well d ; ne, they will only require watering to 
settle the new earth about the balls that are 
already surrounded with roots. To do this, 
the ball should be turned out by gently tap- 
ping the edge of the pot against the table or 
potting bench, holding the plant wrong side 
upwards, with a finger on each side to prevent 
it falling down ; the new pot should have a 



bit of sponge at the bottom, or some crocks 
or moss by way of drainage, and then a little 
soil ; then place the ball of earth on it, and 
press it till the surface of it is about as high 
in the pot as it ought to be. The compost 
should then be put round and pressed gently 
down till the space is filled ; they must then 
be watered gently to settle the earth, and be 
placed out again on the hard ground to grow 
as they will. Examine the seedlings of last 
year as they bloom, and throw away all that 
exhibit no novelty or valuable property ; and 
unless a flower be first-rate, do not save a 
badly habited plant. Strike cuttings, if 
wanted. 

August. — The plants, all in full bloom as 
much as they will be, only require regulating, 
and the flowers thinning, so that too many be 
not left on the same branch, and that they 
hang not in each other's way. Subject to 
the. different plans of growing the different 
varieties, the plants must be managed accord- 
ing to their habits. The seedlings are still to 
be attended to, out of doors, so that their 
natural growth shall be seen. It is of the 
highest importance that they should be allowed 
to grow as they are inclined, without topping 
or stopping, or checking in any way, that 
their true natural habit may be seen ; care 
must be taken that they do not root through 
the pots into the ground they stand on, and 
the moisture must be attended to more parti- 
cularly than in the large collection, for they 
are more exposed. Fertilize the principal 
sorts with the pollen of such as may be thought 
likely to give an improved change, and tie the 
pods so fertilized. Examine the seedlings of 
last year as they open, and select only those 
which are really novel and beautiful, and of 
good habit, for keeping. Cuttings may be 
struck at any time if they are required. 

September. — The large plants as they pass 
their prime, may be placed out of doors, and 
if seed be not wanted, pick off all the pods 
inclined to swell, retaining those which may 
have been fertilized and marked as such. It 
is necessary that such as have seed to 
ripen, should be housed again in the green- 
house or pit, or in some way sheltered from 
frost. Towards the end of the month let all 
the seedlings be placed in pits which can be 
covered from frost, as their young growth, 
and their inclination to continue it longer than 
the principal plants, render them more suscep- 
tible of damage than any other. They require 
no heat, but they must be well preserved from 
frost. Cuttings may be taken at this as well 
as at any other period, when it is at all desi- 
rable to increase a variety, but in proportion to 
its value, so it should be carefully managed ; 
the most valuable may be thus treated : — Let 
the cuttings contain two joints, one from above 



THE FUCHSIA.

the surface to make the plant, and one from 
below the surface to make the root ; let the 
pots be filled to within an inch of the top with 
proper soil to grow in ; knock the pot on the 
bench two or three times to settle it down 
level, then put half 'an inch of silver sand on 
the top ; stick the cutting into the bottom of 
the sand, so as to touch the compost, but not 
to go into it, and let there be room to place a 
bell-glass so as to let the edge of it into the 
sand a little way : water them in, cover up, 
place them on a slight bottom heat, wipe the 
glasses dry daily, and keep them moist. 

Octobkr. — Those plants which still retain 
their beauty, may be used in the house, the 
conservatory, or greenhouse, as long as they 
are worth a place ; but as their beauty declines, 
they must be prepared for rest by withholding 
water. The seed pods must be picked off as 
they ripen, and should be laid exposed to the 
air in a dry and warm place. Those which 
have thoroughly gone by, may be placed out 
of the way anywhere in the houses, so that 
they do not get moisture by accident : under 
the shelves of the greenhouse would do, but 
they should be laid on their sides if there be 
any danger of drippings of water reaching 
them. Seedlings must be continued in their 
pits, or if in greenhouses, must be allowed to 
grow while they seem inclined, because seed- 
lings differ in their growth and season of rest ; 
while they grow they must have a little mois- 
ture, and as much air as can be given in mild 
weather ; they are all the better if the lights 
are quite open. Take cuttings of all the 
kinds you wish to propagate, and especially of 
all the sorts required for bedding out ; let 
them be placed in pots, and covered with 
bell-glasses : they will strike in the green- 
house, and may be hastened by a little bottom 
heat, if wanted for early bloom. New sorts 
may also require great assiduity in striking 
cuttings. 

November. — The management of the pre- 
sent month is like that of the last. In no 
particular does it differ, unless the plants 
themselves differ; for instance, as the leaves 
fall, and the plants decline, they must be de- 
prived of water, and be put at rest. The 
same is to be observed with the seedlings, for 
some will show that they have done growing, 
and may then be brought into the greenhouse, 
or left in the frame ; but there are many dry 



shelves in the greenhouse, which are better 
adapted for the young seedling plants than a 
moist frame after they have done growing : if 
they remain in the frame, they must have no 
water after the leaf falls. Covering from 
frost is essential, for although fuchsias in the 
open ground frequently stand a moderate 
winter, the same cold would kill them if their 
roots were next to the side of a pot instead of 
underground. Examine the pods of seed, that 
they do not turn mouldy ; on the least appear- 
ance of this, it is better to wash them out of 
their pulp and dry them. See also that the 
plants which are at rest are not permitted to 
dry quite, for if the moisture were all out of 
the mould, they would die. Cuttings that are 
struck may be potted off to grow, or be 
allowed to remain nearly at rest, for they 
will take no harm all the winter. 

December. — Continue the same manage- 
ment as last month, in all respects, both to 
seedlings and to the general collection. Pre- 
pare the compost for potting and repotting, 
by getting turfs cut as if for laying down, and 
piling them up to rot ; there is no better 
compost, although for want of this we are 
forced to mix leaf mould and decomposed 
dung, both of which must be provided in case 
we are driven to use purer and poorer loam. 
By this time all the plants will be at rest, and 
require no other care until they are wanted to 
grow. Cuttings striking or struck, must be 
examined, and wherever any have damped off, 
they must be pulled out and removed, to pre- 
vent the mildew from spreading. It is a very 
common thing to take a quantity of cuttings 
at the fall of the year, and put them in common 
pots close together, that they may take but 
little room, and to place them anywhere out 
of the weather, keeping them just moist 
enough to prevent their drying, and they 
generally strike in a few weeks -without glass- 
ing, after the same manner as China roses are 
struck during the winter months. But those 
who have propagating houses and bottom heat 
at command, do not care to take off cuttings 
for general use until they prune the plants for 
their spring growth ; and then a few weeks 
makes a first-rate plant, ready either for 
bedding out or potting. It is only in case of 
wishing to propagate for sale, that we are 
induced to take cuttings at all periods of the 
year, as the plant can spare them. 






32-1 



THE FUCHSIA, 




There has been much controversy about 
the proper form of the Fuchsia, but we are not 
at all inclined to give up the properties we 
originally laid down. The principal point for 
which some people contend is the drooping of 
the points of the sepals ; so many thousand 
more close about their corolla than open 
fairly out and show it, that the raisers cannot 
reconcile themselves to throwing away their 
pets for nothing. The sketch we have now 
given may be taken to represent one of the 
best we have. It will be observed that there 
are several points gained by the present form. 
In the first place, there is the entire corolla, 
which is the richest portion of a bloom, ex- 
posed. In the second place, there is the better, 
that is to say, the inner surface of the sepals 
shown, and the outer side concealed by turning 
completely up, or reflexing. The brightness 
of flowers so made is striking as compared 
with those which scarcely open, and no one 
w r ould hesitate an instant as to which was the 
better variety. Many Fuchsias open out 
enough to show the corolla ; Riccartoni and 
Formosa Elegans open out horizontally ; many 
others are still more reflexed, but most of them 
have some condemning fault. There are but 
few which completely hide the dull side of the 
sepal, and expose the brighter surface, and of 
those which do, most of them have a tube so 
long that the reflexing sepals do not conceal 
it as they would if it were shorter. "We have 
already said, the sepals and corolla must be 
very much contrasted, and the more the better. 



"White is a contrast with any thing ; even a 
pale rose is pretty if the white sepals be really 
pure ; but violet, pink, crimson, scarlet, or rich 
purple are still better, because more strikingly 
different ; with a scarlet sepal nothing short 
of the darkest blue or purple can be tolerable. 
The mere difference between light red and 
dark red, like the variety called Mrs. Lane, is 
worse than a positive self. The new Fuchsia, 
One-in-the-ring, is very striking as a white 
with a scarlet corolla. Lady Peel is a striking 
flower. The Duchess of Sutherland, Ne 
plus ultra, Miss Prettyman, and some others 
of that class, rank among the pretty ones. 
Were it not for the exceeding purity of the 
white in One-in-the-ring, the length of tube 
would be a great objection, but the white is 
good, as it has been shown in public ; and if 
it be necessary to keep it in the shade to pro- 
duce the white, why we suspect some others 
would be the same. Millie's Napoleon is white 
if grown in a shady house, and pinky if grown 
in the open air or in pits, in which state it is 
only one of a thousand. 

All the varieties we have mentioned are 
inferior to our present sketch, for the reasons 
we have named. We like the form of Globosa 
while in bud, and the form w r e have given 
when fully bloomed. We hope in due time 
we shall be able to impress upon the mind of 
the raisers the necessity that exists for the con- 
summation of all the properties we have men- 
tioned, before we can call a variety perfect. 

There is no form so beautiful as the globe. 



THE MORAL INFLUENCE OF GARDENING. 



325 



There is no degree of opening so perfect as 
the complete reversal of the sepals to form a 
globe by reflexing. 

There is not two shades of red that can be 
good, however distant in shade, as compared 
with those of completely opposite colours, 
though very light and very dark may be 
tolerated for want of better. 

The habit of a Fuchsia is important. Those 
which grow rapidly, and become naturally long 
in the joints, and have the leaves far apart, 
are objectionable, for they never can be made 
to form bushy graceful specimens ; they may 
be stopped frequently, and the lateral branches 
be thus encouraged, which lateral shoots may 
again be stopped, and by these means some- 
thing may be done to increase their beauty ; 
but the only way to bring such a habit into 
any thing like passable appearance, is to grow 
them in very plain loam, without dung or 
dressing, and to encourage rather a stunted 
growth ; this will help them greatly, although 
they will not grow half so fast. Others that 
are naturally very short and thick can hardly 
be grown in compost too rich. 

The footstalks of the flowers should be long 
enough to allow the blooms to fall well below 
the foliage ; and there should be flowers at the 
base of every leaf. 



THE PROPERTIES OF THE FUCHSIA. 

1. The petals of the inside, or corolla, must 
be a different colour from the outside, for 
contrast is essential ; those, therefore, which 
are all of a colour are comparatively worthless. 

2. The brighter the scarlet outside, and the 
deeper the purple inside, the better the flower. 
The loss of the rich purple is fatal, therefore, 
to the scarlet Fuchsia. But a Fuchsia may 
be white outside, and in that case a bright 
scarlet corolla would be a good contrast, 
though a purple would be better. 

3. The form of the buds or drops before 
they open cannot be too round, because that 
form is the most beautiful before opening, and 
gives the widest sepals when open. 

4. The footstalk of the flower should be 
long enough to let the bloom fall beneath the 
leaves, and not long enough to let them hang 
into the branch below them, for the flowers 
should all hang free of the foliage. 

5. The corolla should be large and close, 
and the sepals should reflex, to expose their 
inside surface, and to show the corolla out well. 

6. The anthers should hang conspicuously 
below the corolla, and the pistil below them. 

7. The flowers of a Fuchsia should come 
out at the base of every leaf all over the plant, 
and we have many which do so. 



THE MORAL INFLUENCE OF GARDENING. 



If there were any doubt as to the influence 
of gardening on the minds and general habits 
of the working classes, the simple fact, that 
the clergy of all denominations are foremost 
in the ranks of its patrons and promoters, 
should convince us of its beneficial tendency; 
but a transitory glance at the inmates of a 
cottage where the garden is neatly cultivated, 
is enough to show that the concomitants of 
industry — comfort and prudence — reign over 
the affairs of the place. In a work, which we 
hardly recollect the subject of, there was 
almost a sermon comprised in a single sen- 
tence. It is strongly impressed on our me- 
mory, and is pertinent to the matter here. 
The author says : — " Gardening is the most 
rational of all recreations. It teaches fore- 
thought, industry, and economy of time. It 
exerts the mind, invigorates the frame, and 
constantly reminds us of the great God whose 
hand is imprinted on every leaf, and who, in 
his bountiful goodness, rewards us with the 
fruits of the earth. To teach the cottager to 
manage his garden, is to lead him to happi- 
ness. To induce the higher classes to love 
flowers, is to find them innocent gratification, 
and provide employment for thousands." 
There is truth in every word of this. " Gar- 
dening is the most rational of all recreations." 



It is healthful, and every hour expended in it 
as an occupation is rewarded by the effect of 
it on the crops. The industry bestowed on 
a garden is always profitable, and the profit 
sweetens labour. It is a sorry thing to con- 
template the hours that are wasted by the 
labouring classes in those places where there 
are no gardens, and it is scarcely to be helped. 
What is a man to do when he leaves his work ? 
It is not to be supposed that he can sit down 
quietly for hours; yet what can he occupy his 
mind with ? He may while away some of the 
time with reading ; but reading, notwithstand- 
ing cheap literature, is expensive. He seeks 
in society the amusement which he cannot 
find alone, and society can only be found at 
the public-house ; then there is a double evil, 
because, besides the waste of precious hours, 
there is a necessary expenditure ; or, perhaps, 
he resorts to the skittle-ground, the bagatelle 
table, or other gambling amusements, in which 
case the loss to his family is far more serious. 
Man is a social animal, and unless he has 
occupation, he gets into mischief. It is almost

THE WILD P^EONIA. 



man, unused to tippling, has been totally ruined 
by bis leisure hours ; and it is mueb to be 
regretted tbat tbere are no means of profitably 
employing tbe interval between business and 
bed time. If a man has his garden, he blends 
amusement with labour, and profit with both. 
Gardening teaches forethought, because all 
the operations are performed with a view to 
the future. VTe sow because we desire to 
reap. We plan all our affairs with regard to 
some ulterior, not a present result ; and this 
gives us a habit of thinking and of calculation. 
A piece of ground is no sooner cleared of its 
crop than we begin to consider what is the 
best thing to occupy it with, and how soon it 
will be vacant again. Gardening exalts the 
mind ; of this fact there can be no doubt. 
Every leaf and flower proclaims the wisdom 
and goodness of the Almighty. The man 
who can watch the progress of vegetation, 
and the effects of the seasons,without being im- 
pressed with a proper notion of his Maker's 
bounty, must be insensible to everything. 
Gardening invigorates the frame. There is 
hardly an exercise so healthful ; the whole 
body is in motion in the different operations. 
The digging, hoeing, and weeding, keep all 
the muscles in play ; and it is admitted by all, 
that the smell of the newly turned earth is 
congenial to health ; a fact proved also by the 
longevity and hearty lives of the agricultural 
labourers. The man who loves his garden, 
wants no other amusement, and instead of 
wasting his substance in the very natural 
pursuit of occupation for his mind among 
companions similarly situated, he finds every 
shilling in his pocket, and the economy of his 
household greatly assisted by the crops in his 
garden ; independently of which, there is 
downright enjoyment, in every sense of the 
word, from the time the ground is dug to the 
period of reaping the fruit. The Clergy have 
seen this, and are, therefore, warm patrons 
of the science. They have seen, with great 
satisfaction, that to give a man a garden is to 
give him profitable occupation for his leisure 
hours, and keep him out of mischief; and 
they have always been foremost in the pro- 
motion of Horticultural Societies and allot- 
ments of land to the poor. It is gratifying 
to see the change that has been made in 
whole town? and villages by the establishment 
of Horticultural Societies and the encourage- 
ment of cottage gardening. It is almost in- 
credible to witness the improvement that a 
few allotments have made, and it is much to 
be regretted that there are not means taken 
to increase the number of gardens — for there 
are very few things contribute so much to the 
changing of idlers and drunkards into useful 
members of society, as the means they afford 
-of profitably engaging their leisure time. 



THE WILD PJEONIA. 
Tite character of the genus Poeonia is as 
follows : — Calyx of five persistent sepals. 
Petals five or more, nearly orbicular. Disk 
fleshy, surrounding the ovaries. Carpels 
(follicles) two to five, one-celled, many-seeded, 
bursting inn-arch, crowned with the bilaminated 
stigmas. Roots fascicled. Cauline leaves, 
twice ternate. Flowers large. One species 
is met with naturalized in this country. 




Paotiia ccyralllna. 

P. corallina, Retzius (entire-leaved Paeony). 
Radical leaves, twice ternate ; leaflets ovate, 
entire, glaucous beneath, capsules downy, re- 
curved from the base. A herbaceous peren- 
nial, growing two feet high, with fleshy fibrous 
roots, erect stems, and solitary terminal 
flowers, about four inches across, of a beauti- 
ful crimson colour, with yellow anthers ; the 
petals are roundish-oblong, and concave ; the 
follicles, or seed-vessels, are of a coriaceous 
texture. Flowers in May and June. Found 
on the rocky cliffs of the Steep Holmes in the 
Severn, but probably naturalized. 

The Pasony is a well-known showy, even 
magnificent border flower ; but the wild sorts 
are much eclipsed by the handsome cultivated 
varieties which are numerous in our gardens. 
Even the single ones are showy, but the 
double varieties are really gorgeous; and they 
are numerous, and of many different colours, 
from white to deep rose, through various 
shades of pink and red. A yellow-flowered 
single species has been recently introduced, 
but is yet very rare. The Greeks thought 
it to be a flower of divine origin, and to have 
emanated from the moon, and that it shone 
during the night: they believed also that it 
had the power of averting tempests, and pro- 
tecting their harvests from injury, driving

away evil spirits, &c. It is probable that 
from these superstitions, handed down to 
modern times, the belief has arisen, that what 
are called " anodyne necklaces," which are 
still sold in shops, and turned out of the dried 
roots of the Paeony, will prevent convulsions 
in children, and render the cutting of their 
teeth easier. 

Much might yet be done in hybridising 
the Paeony; and "the subject is well worthy 
the attention of florists. 

THE SPIRANTHES, OR LADY's TRESSES. 

Among the smaller of the species of Orchids 
which are natives of Britain, are three species 
of Spiranthes, by some called Neottia. They 
are plants which can lay claim to no great 
amount of beauty, but each of these is interest- 
ing to the botanical investigator, and one, the 
Spiranthes cernua, is, perhaps, the most rare 
and local plant of the whole British flora, 
being found, so far as is known, only in one 
spot in the three kingdoms. Of this plant the 
accompanying cut will give a very good idea. 

Spiranthes autumnalis, Richard (fragrant 
Lady's tresses). — Tubers ovate-oblong, thick ; 
radical, or root leaves, ovate-oblong stem 
leaves like bracts ; spike dense. A small tu- 
berous rooted perennial plant, with three or 
four short oblong tubers, from which are pro- 
duced ovate-oblong leaves, and a dense spike 
of small greenish white blossoms, supported 
on a stem from four to six inches in length ; 
the flowers in the spike all point in the same 
direction from one line ; but, from the spiral 
twisting of the spike, they are made to appear 
as though pointing in all directions. Flowers 
in August and September. Found in dry 
hilly chalky and gravelly pastures and open 
places. It is also called Neottia spiralis 
(Swartz), and Ophrys spiralis (Idnntsus). 

Spiranthes cestivalis, llichard (summer 
Lady's tresses). — Tubers elongated cylin- 
drical ; radical leaves oblong lanceolate, stem 
leaves narrowly lanceolate ; spike dense. A 
small tuberous rooted perennial, producing 
four or five elongated tubers, oblong lance- 
shaped leaves, and a stem of from three inches 
to a foot in height, bearing a spirally twisted 
band of greenish white flowers, with the lip 
larger than in the last. Flowers in July and 
August. Found in a bog in theNew Forest, and 
also at St. Owen's pond, Jersey, but a rare plant. 

Spiranthes cernua, Richard (drooping La- 
dy's tresses). — Tubers elongated cylindrical ; 
radical leaves linear lanceolate, stem leaves 
triangular lanceolate ; spike dense. A small 
perennial plant, with two fleshy oblong cylin- 
drical tubers, about four linear lanceolate leaves 
two or three inches long, and an oblong dense 
spike of rather large milk-white flowers, 



arranged spirally in three rows, and situated 
at the top of a stem about six inches high. 
Flowers in August. Found in North Ame- 
rica, at Fort Vancouver, and the Rocky 
Mountains ; and in the British Islands, only 
at Bearhaven, Cork, where it seems confined to 
a very few spots near the sea-shore, occupy- 
ing the drier parts of rather boggy fields. A 
beautiful figure and description was published 




Spiranthes cernua. 

in the Linncean Transactions, about two years 
since, prior to which time very little was 
known about the Irish plant. It has been 
called Ophrys cernua (Linnreus), Neottia 
gemmifara (Smith), and Spiranthes gemmi- 
fara, (Lindley). 

These plants can only concern the cultiva- 
tor as mere objects of curiosity, being too 
small to be grown for any purposes of orna- 
ment. Such being the case, it is most advisa- 
ble to have a few plants cultivated in pots, 
where they are at all required. Being small, 
small pots will suffice for them, or several 
plants may be put together in a larger one. 
The peculiarities of their natural habitats 
should be regarded in providing them with 
soil ; thus, S. autumnalis grows in chalky or 
gravelly places, and may be grown in a mix- 
ture of loam with chalk ; S. cestivalis grows 
in bogs, and should be potted in turfy peat, 
and kept moist ; and S. cernua, grows in salt 
marshes, and should have a sandy loamy soil 
and libations of weak saline mixtures. They are

quite hardy, but would most conveniently be 
kept with such small herbaceous or alpine 
plants as require protection in winter. 

The generic character of Spiranthes is as 
follows : — Perianth ringent (flower gaping). 
Lip channelled, clawed, fringed. Stigma 
roundish, with a rostellum (beak), which is 
straight, bifid (two cleft), with an elongate 
lineai* appendage between its points. The 
general appearance of the plants and their 
blossoms will be understood from their station 
amongst orchidaceous plants. The three na- 
tives species are called S. autumnalis, S. cesti- 
ralis, and S. cernua.

The GuernseyLily. — Vast numbers of the 
Amaryllis sarniensis, or Guernsey Lily, are 
annually obtained direct from Guernsey, 
where they are largely cultivated, and sold in 
the seed shops; but, like Hyacinths, they are 
seldom bloomed the second season, or if 
flowered at all produce weak and unsatisfac- 
tory blossoms. There is no doubt they might 
be bloomed year after year, if proper atten- 
tion were paid to their growth; and we find 
this has been done by the late T. A. Knight, 
Esq., who was a most zealous cultivator and 
experimentalist in horticultural matters. In 
relating his experience on this subject, Mr. 
Knight writes :* — 

"I should think the matter of this communi- 
cation scarcely worth notice, if I were not per- 
fectly confident that the same mode of culture 
is applicable to bulb ms roots of every kind 
which do not flower freely (exclusive of those 
which grow in water), and with but little vari- 
ation to plants of every kind. Wishing, how- 
ever, at the present time to confine myself to 
very narrow limits, I shall simply relate the 
experiments which I have made upon the 
Guernsey Lily, with the conclusions which I 
have drawn from the result of those experi- 
ments; and my narrative will I think be most 
plain and intelligible, if I confine it to treat- 
ment through successive seasons, of a single 
root of that plant. 

" A bulb of the Guernsey Lily, which had 
flowered in the autumn of 1822, was placed 
in a stove as soon as its blossoms had withered, 
in a high temperature, and damp atmosphere. 
It was planted in very rich compost, and was 
amply supplied with water, which held manure 
in solution. Thus circumstanced, the bulb, 
which was placed in the front of a curvilinear 
roofed stove, emitted much luxuriant foliage, 
which continued in a perfectly healthy state 
till spring. Water was then given in smaller

and gradually reduced quantities till the month 
of May, when the pot in which it grew was 
removed into the open air. In the beginning 
of August the plant flowered strongly, and 
produced several offsets. These, with the ex- 
ception of one, were removed ; and the plant, 
being treated precisely as in the preceding 
season, flowered again in August 1824. In 
the autumn of that year it was again transfer- 
red to the stove, and subjected to the same 
treatment, and in the latter end of the follow- 
ing summer, both bulbs flowered in the same 
pot with more than ordinary strength, the 
one flower- stem supporting eighteen, and the 
other nineteen, large blossoms. One of these 
flowered in the beginning of August, when its 
blossoms were exposed to the sun and air 
during the day, and protected by a covering 
of glass during the night, by which mode of 
treatment I hoped to obtain seeds; but the 
experiment was not successful. The blossoms 
of the other bulb appeared in the latter end of 
August, and were placed in the same situation 
in the stove which the bulb had occupied in 
the preceding winter; and I by these means 
obtained three apparently perfect seeds. 

In the foregoing experiments, I conceive 
myself to have succeeded in occasioning the 
same bulbs to afford blossoms in successive 
seasons; by having first caused the production 
of a large quantity of true sap, and subse- 
quently, by the gradual abstraction of moisture, 
having caused that sap to have become inspis- 
sated, and in consequence adapted to the pro- 
duction of blossom buds. Some gardeners 
entertain an opinion that bulbs may be excited 
to produce blossom buds by being kept very 
dry, after their leaves have withered: but I 
believe this opinion to be wholly unfounded; and 
that the blossoms are always generated whilst 
the living foliage remains attached to the bulb." 
The Cranberry. — The Cranberry grows in 
swamps, and the late Sir Joseph Banks cul- 
tivated them successfully in a fish pond. 
The following is a method of growing them 
without such aid, as practised by Robert 
Hallett, Esq., F.H.S. :— 

" In April, 1818,1 filled half-a-dozen shallow 
boxes, each about eighteen inches square, and 
four inches deep, with peat earth, and planted 
in them, at one inch apart, cuttings* of the 
cranberry, about an inch and a half in length, 
placing them in my melon bed, where they 
were frequently watered ; the cuttings rooted 
freely and threw out strong shoots, and 
in the June following they were fit to plant 
out. 

" Having collected from a dry hill, where 
wild heaths flourished in abundance, a suffi-

old plants, for the old wood will root equally as well 
as the young branches.

cient quantity of peat earth,* I formed a bed 
one hundred and fifty feet long by four feet 
wide. In order to give the plants room to 
extend their roots freely, I caused eighteen 
inches in width of the centre part of this bed 
to be excavated throughout its whole length 
the depth of two feet, and having first covered 
about two inches of the bottom of the trench 
with small wood, I filled it up with the peat 
earth, well trod in ; on the sides of the bed, 
to the extent of its width, I put only six 
inches depth of this mould. About the end 
of June, 1818, I placed one row of plants in 
the centre of this bed, about two feetf apart 
from each other in the row; these soon put 
forth luxuriant runners, extending before the 
winter to the edges of the bed. At the close 
of the year 1819, the bed was covered with 
the plants, and the runners of the former 
year had thrown out a number of upright 
bearing shoots, from which, the following 
year, I gathered several bottles of excellent 
fruit, much superior in flavour to any im- 
ported berries I have ever tasted. In the 
autumn of 1820, I had the satisfaction to see 
the entire bed filled so completely by the 
plants, as to form a mass through which 
scarcely a weed could penetrate, the whole 
exhibiting a profusion of bearing branches. 

" The plants, after the first supply, may 
easily be propagated to any extent that may 
be required, for though they root more freely 
under glass, yet a hot bed is not absolutely 
necessary to raise them. I have known the 
cuttings strike well, and make good plants in 
pots in the open air, and after being rooted 
they require no trouble to preserve them. 
One of the boxes of those raised in 1818 was 
left exposed to the open air throughout three 
summers and as many winters, and though 
no care was bestowed on the plants, and the 
depth of earth did not exceed four inches, 
yet neither the summer's heat nor winter's 
cold affected them, and they produced some 
very fine berries. This proves their hardy 
nature, and that an exposed situation will not 
be inimical to the health of the plants. The 
berries I have likewise found to be as little 
susceptible of injury from being allowed to 
remain out late in the season, for on ex- 
amining my bed in April, I discovered that 
out of a considerable number which had not 
been gathered in the autumn, many were at 
that time in a perfect state on the branches. 

"Four feet is the most convenient width for 
the beds, but by passing the shoots under a 
path formed of peat earth, wherein they would

sod in it ; that had previously been taken off to the 
thickness of about two inches, and dried for fuel.

the centre of the bed, the shoots would soon meet. 



root, other beds might soon be established on 
each side. From four to six inches depth of 
peat earth would be sufficient for such beds, 
and the paths should be level with them, it 
being desirable not to drain off the moisture. 

" Dry heathy commons and wastes would 
produce a large supply of these fruits, with 
little labour or expense, either for the 
markets or for food for moor game. A single 
plant would soon extend itself over a large 
space of ground, if turned up and kept clean 
till the runners had taken root, and as no 
manure is requisite, and little or no weeding 
wanted, the first trouble is all that would be 
necessary, except in situations where hares 
or rabbits abound : these animals are parti- 
cularly fond of the young plants, and a 
temporary fence must be made to protect 
them from their depredations. 

"Dung is peculiarly injurious to the cran- 
berry ; it absolutely destroys it, as I have 
proved by a variety of experiments, in which 
I found that all the plants completely failed 
which were planted in any compost of which 
garden mould or dung formed a part. Peat 
earth is the only soil in which they will 
flourish : nor can a supply of this very 
valuable fruit be expected except in situations 
where the plants will have a due enjoyment 
of sun and air." 

[The American cranberry ( Oxy coccus ma- 
crocarpus) is preferable to the common Eng- 
lish kind (O. palustris), bearing larger fruit, 
and as some consider, of better flavour. J 

Melons from Cuttings. — The plan of 
raising a second crop of melons from cuttings 
taken from a former crop which has produced 
fruit has some advantages ; Mr. C. Harrison, 
formerly gardener at "Wortley Hall in York- 
shire, thus describes his method of doing this, 
and its success : — 

" When the first crop of. fruit is nearly 
gathered, I take off cuttings from the old 
plants. The cuttings which I select are 
those extremities of shoots which are showing 
the most small fruit. They are cut off close 
under the second advanced joint from the 
top ; the two lower leaves are taken off, and 
each cutting thus prepared is ready for inser- 
tion. I put two cuttings into each pot, and 
insert them close to the side of the pot, filling 
the pots with light rich soil, gently shaking 
it upon the cuttings. The pots used are 
twenty-fours. After being watered, I place 
the pots in a small one-light frame, a hot-bed 
having been previously prepared under it a 
sufficient time to allow the burning heat to 
subside before the bed is thus used. I cover 
the bed to the depth of eight or ten inches 
with moderately dry soil ; in this the pots 
with the cuttings are plunged up to the rim. 
The frame is then kept close for four or five 



330 



PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 



days, in order to retain the steam, which is 
very essential in supporting the cuttings until 
they strike root. The frame is also shaded 
for some time during four or five hours in 
the middle of the day. Care is also taken 
that the heat is not so intense at the bottom 
of the pots as to burn the cuttings. In about 
a week the cuttings, if properly managed, will 
have struck root ; this will be shown by their 
shoots pushing. 

The first crop of melons having been 
gathered from the old plants, I take out the 
soil in which they have grown, and replace it 
with some new, to the depth of twelve inches. 
The beds are also at the same time lined 
with fresh dung. In about ten days from 
the time of inserting the cuttings, they will 
be ready to plant out ; and having prepared 
the original beds as here described, I turn 
out one pot of cuttings entire, under each 
small three-light frame, and to each large 
three-light frame I allot two pots, one to 
each end light. When the plants have pushed 
about fourteen inches, I pinch off the end of 
each shoot, to cause them to produce fresh 
runners. The fruit which had shown pre- 
viously to the cuttings being taken from the 
old plants will, after the cuttings are finally 
planted out, swell very rapidly, and in three 
weeks after the bed has been replanted, I 
have cut abundance of fine fruit, some weigh- 
ing seven or eight pounds each, varying in 
this according to the kind. The plants also 
yield abundantly, being much more produc- 
tive and healthy than if they were old plants 
cut in, in the usual manner. I have 
uniformly gathered of the second crop from 
twelve to twenty fruit in each light. 

A considerable advantage belonging to .this 
plan is, that the plants never run to length, 
they need no more stopping than already 
described, nor do they require any thinning 
of the shoots. I have also to observe, that it 
often happens in melon plants, not raised 
from cuttings, that the stems near the roots 
will crack, and when water is poured upon 
such places it causes the plants to perish ; 
but this is never the case with those raised 
as above described. 

Growing Plants in Moss. — The practice 
of growing plants in moss, though not now a 
novelty, is not without interest. We there- 
fore introduce the following abstract of a paper 
published in the Horticultural Society's Trans- 
actions treating on this subject : it was written 
by Mr. Street, a gardener in East Lothian: — 

"The Mosses I use are the several species of 
Hypnum, such as H. Schreberi, squarrosum, 
purum, &c. ; these I collect in woods from 
under the bushes, taking up with them the 
decaying stalks and leaves which are found 
amongst them. Sometimes I add about an 



inch of the surface of the vegetable mould 
which is under the mosses, to mix with them 
in the pots. The mosses so collected are 
pressed closely into the pots, and the plants 
are put into them as if into mould. For some 
plants I find it useful to add a little loam to 
the mosses, in other cases sharp sand, which 
is sometimes preferable to the loam. If the 
plants require manure I give it in a liquid 
state. As the mosses decay the mass gets 
closer together, and I then fill up the top of 
the pot with fresh material ; but if the roots 
are much at the lower part of the pot, I pre- 
fer making the addition at the bottom. The 
plants which I have cultivated in mosses are 
many ; the following amongst others : — 
Canna indica and patens, Calla sethiopica, 
Agapanthus umbellatus, Hydrangea hortensis, 
Disandra prostrata, Justicia nervosa, Gor- 
teria rigens, Pelargoniums, Cinerarias, &c. 
Some plants do better, and flower earlier and 
more vigorously, in mosses than in mould, 
such as Eucomis striata, Eucomis punctata, 
&c. The roots of whatever things are put 
into the mosses spread and increase sur- 
prisingly, especially such as require to be 
kept wet, for the mosses retain moisture 
longer and more uniformly than mould. Pots 
of ornamental plants which are to be placed in 
the apartments of a house, have great advan- 
tages when filled with mosses, for independent 
of the facility with which they are moved, 
they make no dirt or litter on the floor, which 
often occurs when the pots are filled with mould. 
In sending plants to a distance, those which are 
rooted in mosses travel admirably, they turn 
well out of the pots, and the roots are so 
mixed with the mosses that they do not sepa- 
rate from them as they would from mould ; 
and besides this safety to the plants, the mosses 
are so light that the package is conveyed with 
great comparative ease. I have succeeded in 
striking cuttings of many plants in mosses, 
such as Aucuba japonica, Hibiscus Rosa- 
sinensis, Buddlea globosa, &c, and those 
make roots very freely and much faster than 
they do in mould. I believe the plan might 
be generally adopted in propagation by cut- 
tings. Some bulbs, I do not doubt, will do 
well in mosses ; I have tried the yellow 
crocus, and found it to succeed perfectly, 
and to flower most freely when so treated. 
With hyacinths I have not yet succeeded ; 
the varieties of polyanthus narcissus, such as 
Grand Primo and Bazelman major, blossom 
well when grown with a portion of mosses in 
the pots. Some species of Cape gladioli also 
succeed well." 

[We have bloomed hyacinths with great 
success in moss, and in much shallower vases 
and pots than we generally use for earth or 
water : of course the supply of moisture must

be uninterrupted. We have also employed 
moss in connexion with the drainage, and 
with much success in the case of plants whose 
duration is short ; a small portion spread over 
the drainage to prevent the soil from inter- 
mixing with the crocks is in all cases advan- 
tageous ; and in the case of annuals and 
flower garden plants which are placed in pots 
for a month or two to facilitate transplanting, 
a little moss at the bottom of the pots is 
preferable to the crocks which are usually 
employed.]

AND ORIGINAL NOTES CONNECTED WITH HORTICULTURE 
AND NATURAL HISTORY. 

Eosa Harrisonii. — A plant of this fine 
rose, in the conservatory of the Earl of 
Radnor, at Coleshill House in Berkshire, has 
this season brought to perfection upwards of 
three hundred and fifty blossoms. The plant 
is a standard. It had been subjected to a 
gentle heat, and under these circumstances 
the blooms appeared to be produced in a more 
perfect state than is usual out of doors. It 
has been treated thus : — After flowering, the 
branches were partially cut back, and the 
plants placed out of doors in rich soil, and 
well supplied with liquid manure in the growing 
season. In the autumn they are again taken 
up, and potted, and submitted to a gentle 
heat to accelerate their blooming. 

The Leek. — Of this useful esculent there 
are two principal varieties, the Scotch and 
English ; the former much hardier, thicker- 
growing, and not so soon running to seed, 
the latter generally earlier, and not so hardy, 
but more fitted for autumn and early winter 
use. The leek is generally propagated by 
seeds, and is usually regarded as a biennial — 
not a bulb ; this however is a mistake, a 
number of little bulbs being produced at the 
bottom of the seed stalk, which takes two 
years to arrive at maturity. The leek is 
therefore a true bulbous perennial, requiring 
two years to perfect its bulbs ; and subdividing 
itself after the manner of the potato-onion, 
and thus, like it, may be continued without 
rearing from seeds after a stock of bulbs is 
once obtained. These bulbs should be planted 
in rows nine inches asunder, and four or six 
inches distant in the rows ; they require rich 
deep soil, but it should not have been newly 
manured. In autumn they must be taken 
up, a sufficient quantity stored for use, and 
the rest planted for a new crop. These bulbs 
iire thus easily reared to the size of eight or 
.nine inches in circumference ; and are very 
delicate, much superior to the onion. 

Queen-bees. — At a recent meeting of 
the Entomological Society, Mr. F. Smith 



exhibited a pair of specimens of the queen 
and drone of the hive-bee, which had been 
taken paired by a friend, thus settling the 
long disputed question as to the mode in 
which the queen of the hive is impregnated. 
The queen was very pale in colour, and had 
not the elongated abdomen which characterises 
the old queens. 

The Tea-plant in India. — We learn 
from the Calcutta Gazette, that the efforts 
of Dr. W. Jameson, superintendent of the 
botanic gardens in the north-west provinces 
of India, to introduce and extend the cultiva- 
tion of the tea-plant have been highly suc- 
cessful. The tea brokers in England have, 
moreover, pronounced the Indian tea equal 
to China tea of a superior class, possessing 
the flavour of the orange-pekoe, but more 
than its usual strength, and in other respects 
resembling that imported under the name of 
ning-yong. The tea-tree in Kemaoon is not 
only identical with the China plant, and as 
capable of being made into as fine a descrip- 
tion of tea, but the climate and soil in Ke- 
maoon are as suited to the favourable growth 
of the shrub as the finest of the Chinese 
localities ; and, moreover, the tea is as highly 
prized in the districts in which it has been 
raised as it is in England. One hundred 
and seventy three seers of it were recently 
sold at Almorah, and produced from four to 
five rupees the seer, a price equal to the best 
foreign tea sold in Calcutta. According to 
the calculation of Dr. Jameson, the price for 
which it can be raised is so low as to afford 
the greatest encouragement for the applica- 
tion of capital : he estimates that if cultivated 
on a sufficiently large scale, the prime cost 
in Calcutta, including every expense, would 
be little more than eight annas a seer, or one- 
eighth of the present price. Supposing the 
cost of cultivation to be double what is here 
estimated, a sufficient amount of profit would 
still be left. The capacity of the provinces 
of Kemaoon and Grurhwall for the enlarged 
production of the article, does not moreover 
appear to be limited to particular localities. 
According to the latest report that has been 
furnished, 176 acres were under cultivation, 
containing not fewer than 322,579 plants. 
The crop is thriving in different places over 
four degrees of latitude, and three degrees of 
longitude ; and 100,000 acres are available 
in the Dhoon alone for the purposes of tea 
cultivation. At a maund an acre, they would 
yield 7,600,000 lbs., which is equal to one- 
sixth the entire consumption of England. 

Rhododendrons. — Large masses of rho- 
dodendrons are exactly what are suited to 
form the line of separation between the highly- 
dressed flower garden and the park ; as they 
may be introduced without, in the Jcast, ob-

structing from view the pleasing and varied 
surface of the latter. The various shades of 
colour exhibited in their blooms during the 
flowering season render them attractive and 
interesting objects ; and from their bright 
and glossy foliage, and varied heights, they 
add, at all times, to the general effect of the 
scenery. They are decidedly preferable to 
the tall, mixed, common shrubs, too generally 
planted for such purposes. 

Exposing Greenhouse Plants in Sum- 
mer. — Many greenhouse plants, and espe- 
cially the more delicate kinds, often suffer 
much injury from exposure to the sun's rays 
in summer. "When so exposed without the 
benefit of shelter of any kind, the soil is apt 
to become so thoroughly dried, that it is with 
difficulty again wetted, and hence the scorched 
and stunted looking growth which may some- 
times be seen on such plants in the summer 
season. The injury in most cases arises not 
from exposing the stem and branches of the 
plants, but from exposing the pot in which 
it is growing ; the sun's rays acting on the 
sides of the pots, in conjunction with the 
evaporation constantly going on, soon de- 
prives the soil of its moisture ; and as all the 
tender roots are usually more or less in con- 
tact with the inner surface of the pot, their 
injury is inevitable. It is no uncommon 
thing to see the soil so much dried as to 
shrink quite away from the pot, and in this 
case the roots cannot avoid being more or less 
injured. Under such circumstances, too, the 
water which is supplied sinks down as fast 
as it is poured on, and fails, for a long time 
at least, to moisten the interior of the soil. 
Then again, the necessity for constant water- 
ing caused by this exposure, is an evident 
waste of time. When plants are turned out- 
doors (and also when kept in-doors) their 
roots ought to be sheltered by some means 
from the influences alluded to ; plunging the 
pots in some open porous material will answer 
the end as well as anything ; and of the sub- 
stances that may be employed, moss, coal 
ashes, rough peat, sawdust, or fine charcoal 
are among the best that can be employed. 
It is desirable, also, to afford the entire plants 
a very thin shade during the intense sun heat 
of summer, but the lighter the material em- 
ployed the better. 

Aloysia citriodora. — This is a favourite 
forcing plant, its lemon-like scent being gene- 
rally esteemed. Young plants should be 
raised from cuttings in March or early in 
April ; when they are rooted encourage luxu- 
riant growth by potting them frequently in 
coarse loamy soil and leaf mould, and induce 
a compact bushy habit by frequently pinching 
off the tops of the young shoots until about 
the end of May. Then plant them into a bed 



in the garden, where the soil is open, mode- 
rately rich, and resting on a porous bottom, 
such as a layer of old mortar or rubble ; place 
them a yard apart, and continue stopping the 
young shoots when about two or three inches 
long, until the plants become large compact 
bushes. In September, take them up and pot 
them in large pots, and place them in a close 
cold pit, giving but little water ; the leaves 
will soon fall. In this situation they may 
remain with occasional slight waterings until 
they are required in succession for forcing, 
through the winter months. 

Liquid Manure. — An excellent liquid 
for all kinds of plants grown in pots 
may be prepared by mixing one gallon of 
soot, one bushel of sheeps' dung (deer or cows' 
dung will do), and a quarter of a bushel of 
quicklime, in a hogshead of water. It should 
be well mixed up and stirred when first made, 
and then, once a day, for three or four days, 
strained off into a cask, another quarter of a 
bushel of quicklime being added each time ; 
it will thus readily clarify. This liquid is to 
be used always in a tepid state, when applied 
to plants kept in a high temperature ; to 
strong plants, in the proportion of one gallon 
mixed with two of soft water ; and to weakly 
plants, in the proportion of one to three gal- 
lons of water. The pure water used should, 
of course, be rain water, if it can be obtained ; 
or if spring or well water is necessarily used, 
it should be well aerated — that is, exposed to 
the air and sun in flat open vessels. 

Bulbous Plants. — To check the growth 
of the foliage of bulbous plants is very de- 
cidedly injurious to them. After they have 
done flowering, it should be an object to sti- 
mulate the leaves to make strong and vigor- 
ous growth ; and this should be done under 
the influence of strong bright light, and con- 
tinued till they show symptoms of having 
passed their maturity ; this is generally indi- 
cated by their turning yellowish, and decay- 
ing at the tips. Moisture — both at the root, 
and in the atmosphere — is then to be reduced 
gradually until they are brought to a state of 
rest. It is, therefore, an erroneous though a 
common practice to cut off the foliage of 
hardy bulbs as soon as their bloom is faded, 
or even at any subsequent period, while that 
foliage is in a growing state ; and it is also 
hurtful, though sometimes necessary, to take 
them up and remove them to another place, 
unless this can be done without greatly dis- 
turbing their roots. 

Parasitic fungi infesting inhabited 
houses. — The Rev. E. Sidney recently de- 
livered a very interesting lecture on this sub- 
ject, before the Royal Institution. After 
some introductory remarks relating to the 
various forms of different fungi, and their 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



333 



chemical properties, he proceeded to describe 
the most remarkable of those found trouble- 
some in dwellings, under the following heads : 
— (1.) Fungi infesting timber. Not only the 
Merulius lacrymam and Polyporus destruc- 
tor, but any fungi found on decayed trees, 
were capable of producing dry-rot. From 
small white points there radiates a filamentous 
substance, parallel with the surface of the 
timber ; this is the spawn of the fungus ; it 
soon gains strength, and penetrates the inter- 
cellular passages of the wood, and thus disin- 
tegrates the timber. Mr. Sidney suggested 
that the development of these fungi might 
depend on the condition of the sap in the 
wood. The experiments of Dutrochet on the 
growth of fungi in acid and alkaline solutions, 
tend to elucidate the phenomena of dry-rot. 
Whatever may be the efficacy of Kyan's prin- 
ciple, much might be effected by instituting 
experimental research into the best times for 
felling trees ; spring appears to be the worst 
season. — (2.) Fungi infesting the culinary 
department. Bread is attacked by a Peni- 
cillum,, as well as by two or three other moulds. 
The French troops experienced great injury 
from bread thus poisoned. The fungi attack- 
ing meat are chiefly, according to Mr. Sid- 
ney, Agarics in a rudimentary state. Peni- 
cillum glaucum is, however, found destroying 
salt provisions. — (3.) Fungi infesting cellars. 
These are probably Polypori and allied fungi, 
in various stages of growth. When pressed 
into a state of sufficient consistency, these 
form excellent tinder : none of them will grow 
where rock-salt is present. Fermentation is 
generally attended by the growth of molecular 
spores. Both the yeast and vinegar fungus 
are mere states of Penicillum glaucum, the 
mode of their growth being modified by the 
peculiarity of the medium in which they are 
developed. Mr. Sidney noticed the following 
experiments, made to ascertain whether the so- 
called vinegar-plant was able to produce fermen- 
tation : — Four equal quantities of sugar and 
water became acidified in the following order, 
— a, when containing washed fungus ; b, con- 
taining yeast ; c, containing fungus unwashed ; 
d, when left to itself j in all these cases Peni- 
cillum, glaucum at length appeared. — (4.) 
Fungi infesting store-rooms, &c. These 
situations are chiefly infested by Penicillum 
glaucum ; its growth is said to be prevented 
by any essential oil. Sugar is attacked by 
Torula sacchari. Fruit is subject to several 
fungi. It is remarkable that the brown mat- 
ter on attacked apples and pears has been 
found to produce potato disease by inocula- 
tion. Mr. Berkeley's recent experiments on 
Bunt, show that fungal disease may be propa- 
gated by the mere grumous matter in spores. 
— (5.) Fungi attacking boohs and object- 



glasses of telescoj)es. The former are hairy 
fungi ; the latter the small Penicillum grow- 
ing on the particles of dust which insinuate 
themselves into the glass. — (6 ) Fungi attack- 
ing wardrobes, and the contents of the dairy. 
Under this head Mr. Sidney referred to the 
Penicillum as appearing on leather, and to 
the Torula as infesting cheese. The specu- 
lation of the convertibility of milk globules 
into fungi was noticed as an unsubstantiated 
hypothesis. 

Thinning out Peas. — The principle of 
thinning crops as one means towards securing 
perfect growth is indeed commonly recognised, 
but too seldom acted on. In no culinary 
crop, perhaps, is this remark so well illustrated 
as in the case of garden peas. If we look at 
a crop of peas when they are just vegetating, 
we shall, in almost every case, see the plants 
standing thickly together, forming then, in 
their embryo state, an unbroken line. And 
they are generally allowed to grow on without 
any alteration in this respect. In nine cases 
out of ten, two-thirds — often more — of the 
seed sown is wasted, and the crop is thereby 
injured. All the larger growing kinds of peas, 
therefore, which are grown to supply the 
summer and autumn crops, should be kept 
thin, both by sowing fewer seeds than is usual, 
and subsequently thinning out the plants if 
necessary, so that the plants may stand clear 
of each other ; the largest varieties may be 
thinned to three or four inches apart, the 
smaller ones to two inches. The plants, too, 
instead of being allowed to run up to a great 
height, should be topped once or twice to 
make them bushy. If these two points of 
practice are attended to in conjunction with 
each other, the pea crops would be found to 
furnish successive supplies in much better 
condition than is now often found to be the 
case. 

Epacrises. — The habit of these plants is 
to produce long annual shoots, which, if left 
untouched, would soon render the plants un- 
sightly. During the younger stages of their 
growth, these shoots should be frequently 
topped so as to form bushy plants ; this should 
be continually done, as they grow two or three 
inches in length. When the plants have 
attained a moderately large size, however, this 
topping must not be followed up too rigour- 
ously, or the strength of the bloom will be 
destroyed, as well as the characteristic beauty 
of the plant. At this stage, however, the 
plants must by no means be left to themselves, 
or they soon get out of form. A severe 
annual pruning in of the long straggling 
shoots should be practised, and this may be 
done as soon as flowering is past : they then 
again form moderately strong shoots, which 
are furnished almost throughout their whole 



334 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



length with blossoms at the proper period. 
On the other hand, if the close stopping of 
the shoots is then practised, none but 
small weak shoots can be secured for bloom 
bearing. 

Show Pelargoniums. — Public opinion 
seems to be setting in against the employment 
of so many stakes as have hitherto been used 
in training these lovely flowers for exhibition 
purposes ; although it is not likely to be found 
possible to produce large bushy specimens at 
exhibitions without a considerable number of 
stakes, owing to the necessity of using them 
to ensure safe travelling. In respect to cul- 
ture and bloom, the exhibition plants of the 
present day are surpassingly grand ; but it is 
suggested that even the grandeur and beauty 
of these plants become tiring from the want 
of variety. A few inches higher or lower, 
broader or narrower, is the ordinary range 
which variation in the size and form of the 
plants is allowed to take. The introduction 
of pyramidal training has been recommended 
for the purpose of affording, not only in the 
flower house, but in the exhibition tent also, 
some degree of variety among the plants. 
It is not proposed that the present dwarf com- 
pact bush form should be given up, but merely 
that some few of other forms should be made 
to accompany them for the sake of variety and 
effect. Thus, a few pyramidal pelargoniums, 
three, four, or five feet high above the pot or 
tub, and covered with flowers, both foliage 
and flowers commencing at the top of the pot, 
it is argued, will relieve the monotonous beauty 
now so evident, and would be in themselves, 
exclusive of the variety they afford, objects 
of decided elegance. 

Entrance Gates and Lodges. — Every 
lodge and gate situated at the principal en- 
trance to a mansion, should correspond in style 
with the architecture of the house. The 
visitor, on entering, would then be exempted 
from conjecture, and fully prepared to admire 
on the one hand the beautiful and regular 
proportion of the Grecian, or, on the other, 
the more bold and massive style of the Gothic 
order. It would be difficult to define the style 
of architecture frequently exhibited in those 
incongruous masses of bricks and mortar, 
called lodges, so prevalent at the present day. 
Those who are entrusted with their erection 
should pay more attention to the rules of 
architecture, for lodges and gates give import- 
ance alike to the villa and the mansion. 

Suggestion for Destroying Wire- 
worms. — The milder kind of mercurial oint- 
ment consists of one part of nitrate of mercury 
and thirty of oil and hog's lard. A very 
small portion of this will destroy an insect. 
One pound and a half of the nitrate of mer- 
cury to one cwt. of grease would perhaps be 



sufficient. The economical manufacture of it 
is a question of importance. It might be 
mixed with " greaves," or the refuse of the 
soap-boilers, which, in an experiment tried 
last year, was found more fertilising for tur- 
nips than either bone-dust and ashes, or 
superphosphate of lime and ashes. Perhaps 
the refuse of train-oil manufacturers would 
be found advantageous ; for this mixed with 
sawdust has been found very fertilising. The 
expense of either of these greasy articles, and 
of the nitrate of mercury, would not be much ; 
and their application might destroy the wire- 
worm. 

Improvement of Garden Tools. — It is 
an admitted principle in political economy 
that, in proportion as the amount of produce 
can be increased by a reduction of labour, so 
great is the proportionate increase of wealth 
to the producer. Upon this principle all im- 
proved machinery for the production of our 
manufactures, and implements for the culti- 
vation of the soil, are constructed. In agri- 
culture, where the soil must return a profit 
from the expenditure, this principle meets 
with no little attention. How great, how 
numerous, are the yearly experiments made 
to produce the most perfect implements, by 
which the expenditure might be lessened, 
while the profits might increase. Agricul- 
turists neglect no opportunities of carrying 
these out, while they encourage, by rewards, 
those who produce the most perfect at their 
exhibitions. "What have gardeners to produce 
with regard to horticulture ? Not, certainly, 
such as were used by the ancient Britons, but 
that they serve no better purpose, is nearly all 
that can be said of our present tools and im- 
plements. To learn the use of garden tools, 
such as are placed in their hands, is commend- 
able ; to learn to improve them, more so. 
The same principle which incites the agricul- 
turists should be also paramount with 
gardeners. The improvement of garden tools 
and implements is a subject worthy of earnest 
attention. Mr. Barnes, of Bicton, some time 
since, made some notable improvements in 
the hoe, but some general system is required. 
To have hoes or any other implements or tools 
made to order is an unnecessary expense, if 
they could be done as well by a general manu- 
facturer. Horticultural societies are well 
adapted to afford a stimulus in this matter, 
by offering special prizes for their improve- 
ment ; and they would do well to take the 
matter into consideration in the preparation 
of their Prize Schedules. 

The Chive {Allium Schcenoprasum). — 
Frivolous as this may appear to be, it is not 
the less valuable to the humble cottager, whose 
spring food requires seasoning after his winter 
stock of onions is exhausted. I have grown 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS.

chives for many years, and I think I hear 
some wiseacre say, " Well, surely, there is 
nothing more easy to cultivate, or more simple 
to use, than chives." No doubt ! Yet, strange 
enough, they are neither cultivated nor used 
aright by any gardener, cook, or cottager that 
I have seen yet ; and, after I have explained 
the simple treatment of this truly useful, 
homely plant, every one will cry out, " We 
all knew that." Why, then, did you never 
put it in practice ? To grow chives every- 
body knows right well how. They are gene- 
rally parted in the spring, planted in some 
well-manured soil, either in rows or patches, 
and, when well watered, the tops are soon 
ready for cutting. Now, this little plant is, 
in reality, a bulb, and as such, however small, 
it requires the proper treatment of a bulb ; 
therefore, the time to shift it is certainly not 
the spring, but the autumn — not the time 
when its leaves are just pushing a few inches 
above the surface. Try the hyacinth with 
this treatment, or ask the tulip fancier his 
opinion of this treatment of bulbs. The time 
to plant chives is when they are dormant ; 
and, at that time, they will be found to be 
little bulbs, without roots or leaves, and may 
be ienvn, like onions, on a richly manured 
bed, and covered about an inch deep ; or 
dropped in drills, nine inches asunder, and 
half an inch apart in the drill. Though the 
leaf of the chive grows only about nine inches 
long, the roots of the plant will run three 
feet deep into the earth if they can find food 
and moisture. The proper culture of chives, 
therefore, is to plant them, like other bulbs 
(as tulips, for example), in richly prepared 
land, early in autumn, that is, after their 
foliage has turned sere and yellow. Now, for 
the using of them after they are grown. 
Whether the spring onion be wanted for the 
Scotchman's kale pot, or the cockney's salad 
bowl, is no matter, it is wanted ; and every 
gardener has proved, by the late winter, that 
autumn-sown onions, or, indeed, autumn-sown 
crops of any kind, are liable to be uprooted 
by the frosts, and consequently killed. The 
chive, under ground, is never known to suffer 
from any weather ; and, in proof of this, here 
it is now, nine inches high, green, and fair, 
before the oak has opened a bud to salute the 
spring. To cut the tops off the chives is to 
take the fodder and to leave the grain ; try 
the same doctrine with the common onion or 
the leek, and ask the cook's opinion of the tops 
and tails of leeks and onions for cookery, 
always taking care to leave the blanched 
bottoms of the leeks, and the bulbs of the 
onions, in the garden ; and by these helps, 
and the exercise of common sense, I doubt 
not but all gardeners and cottagers will agree 
with me in digging up the chives, and wash- 



ing them like spring onions, which, in reality, 
they are. — Forsyth, in Gard. Journal. 

Hothouse fires. — Great waste of fuel is 
often the result of the ordinary mode of 
managing hothouse fires. Much of the 
smoke, for instance, which is in itself a 
nuisance, is also a waste, for the gases which 
thus pass away are capable of combustion, and 
thus of increasing the amount of heat which is 
developed. Whenever pure coals or coals 
blended with cinders are employed in furnaces, 
it will be found to be a palliative of this nui- 
sance to push forward towards the neck of the 
flue the bulk of the red-hot fuel, previous to 
mending the fire, and to deposit the fresh fuel 
in front of the glowing mass. The gas which 
is liberated and forms smoke, is thus made to 
pass directly over the hottest part of the fire, 
and to a great extent becomes ignited. The 
bulk of red-hot cinders should be considerable 
before the ash pit doors or dampers are re- 
sorted to, and then, particularly at " damping 
up" for the night, small cinders and moist 
ashes should alone be employed ; on no ac- 
count pure coals. A writer in the Pharma- 
ceutical Times states that a scientific chemical 
remedy for the smoke nuisance offers itself, 
by introducing a cast iron tube from a boiler, 
to convey a column of steam to be dispersed 
by a rose nozzle over the surface of the cok- 
ing coal. New combinations thus take place, 
which affect the entire combustion of the in- 
flammable gases, and where it has been ap- 
plied the disappearance of the column of 
black smoke has immediately followed its 
application. 

The Carrot Grub. — I find that trench- 
ing the ground two spits deep, and spreading 
some manure at the bottom of every trench, is 
almost an effectual cure for this troublesome 
insect, which was always very prevalent till I 
adopted this plan. I always do this work in 
autumn, leaving the surface of the ground 
rough during winter, and at the proper season 
it is deeply hoed, raked level, drilled, and 
sown, without adding any more manure. The 
half decomposed contents of the rubbish heap 
answer very well for putting into the trenches, 
and save better clung for other purposes. 
Besides preventing injury by the grub, I find 
that both carrots and parsnips grow much 
straighter under this treatment than when the 
manure is dug into the ground in the usual 
way. In the next autumn the trenched 
ground is well manured and roughly dug for 
onions in the ensuing spring. — Whiting in 
Gardener's Chronicle. 

Olea Fragrans. — The following is a ready 
method of propagating and flowering this fra- 
grant plant : — In March or April collect a 
number of suckers, according to the quantity 
of plants required, from an old privet plant or 



336 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



hedge ; pot the suckers or offsets in light, rich, 
soil, in four-inch pots ; head tbem down to 
within four inches of the surface of the soil, 
and immediately ingraft an olive scion, six 
inches long, on the stock, so that part of the 
scion is above the stock and a part below it ; 
the latter portion is inserted in a small bottle 
filled with water. Tie the scion and stock 
tightly together with bass, and put a little moss 
over the top, instead of clay ; then plunge them 
in a cucumber frame, where they quickly be- 
come united. Stocks grafted in spring make 
handsome plants by autumn, and flower early 
in the following spring. The olive, worked 
on privet stocks, produces flowers much larger 
and sooner than when propagated from cut- 
tings, suckers, or layers. The method deserves 
to be more generally adopted, because less 
wood and more flowers are produced. 

Maize or Indian Corn. — By the following 
treatment good samples of maize, plump and 
well ripened, were grown in this country dur- 
ing 1846 : — To obtain new seed is of the first 
importance. The Novia Scotia variety, which 
is that generally recommended, was the kind 
grown. The ground was prepared in the early 
part of winter by manuring and rough dig- 
ging ; lines were drawn three feet apart, and, 
at a distance of three feet apart along these 
lines, four holes about three inches from each 
other were dibbled, into each of which a grain 
was dropped. The patches of plants thus 
ranged in squares three feet distant. The 
seed was sown in the first week in April, which 
in ordinary seasons is at least a fortnight too 
late. When the plants were two inches high, 
the ground was carefully hoed, and this opera- 
tion was repeated several times, both to assist 
the plants, and to cleanse the ground. In 
September the bloom-stalk at top was cut off, 
and the loose leaves were removed to give the 
corn the benefit of as much sun as possible. 
In three or four weeks from this it was ripe 
enough to cut. The general appearance of 
the plot was not inferior to what may 
occasionally be seen even in the United 
States. This plan was practised in the county 
of Surrey, and the result was very successful. 
The maize, even when not grown for the sake 
of its ripe grain, furnishes, when the ears or 
heads of corn are cut in the green state, a very 
excellent vegetable for boiling. To bring it 
to this state there is no risk whatever, for 
after the ears are cut, the whole of the re- 
mainder is excellent food for cattle and for 
pigs. 

Poisoning by Parsnips. — M. Buehner 
quotes several cases of narcotic effects caused 
by the use of parsnip ( Pastinaca sativa) 
having been observed since 1829. It would 
appear that the root of the parsnip in the first 
year produces no injurious effects ; after the 



winter, however, as the formation of wood 
goes on, and the plant blossoms, it acquires 
poisonous qualities. M. Buehner directs at- 
tention to the fact that the celery also is some- 
times productive of narcotic symptoms, and is 
of opinion that the latter case occurs only 
with the root dug out the second year. He 
finally adds that it seems, as a consequence, that 
the water hemlock ( Cicuta virosa) may be 
less virulent the first year of its existence, 
previous to forming stalks, flowers, and 
fruits. 

Camellia, Countess of Orkney. — This is 
a seedling raised by Mr. Nicholson, gardener 
to the Earl of Orkney, at Taplow ; it is a 
vigorous growing variety, with good foliage 
and large flowers of a blush-white ground, 
striped with two shades of rose ; the four 
outer rows of petals are broad and well formed, 
and, in the fresh opened blossoms somewhat 
cupped, filled out in the centre with smaller 
petals ; in the older flowers these outer petals 
become reflexed. It is a distinct and showy 
variety; but hardly full enough of petals. 

Vermin in Hothouses. — Most people are 
aware that woodlice, earwigs, slugs, &c, are 
very destructive in hothouses. A visitor to 
Mr. Van Houtte's establishment, at C' ; '°.nt, 
recently noticed his freedom from these pt'sts, 
and on inquiry as to the means employed to 
keep the plants free, his attention was directed 
to a pretty lizard which basked its scales in a 
sunbeam, to some Carabi aurati which ran 
with agility among the pots, and to several of 
those innocent blindworms against which the 
peasants in their ignorance wage such dread- 
ful war. The mystery was cleared up ; 
two or three blindworms, as many lizards, 
several carabi — and there is no more 
harm to befeared from these pests in our hot- 
houses. 

To Cook Vegetable Marrow. — Have a 
gallon saucepan more than half full of boiling 
water : one minute before putting in the mar- 
row, throw in a tea-spoonful of salt, and half 
a one of carbonate of soda. Cut the marrow 
into four parts lengthways, always without 
peeling it; if small, they need only be halved; 
if large, divide each quarter transversely. 
Put them quickly into the water, keeping it 
rapidly boiling all the time ; they will take 
from a quarter to half an hour, according to 
age and kind. While the marrow is boiling, 
make about a third of a pint of melted butter, 
and a round of toast ; cut off the crust, dip 
the toast in the water they are boiling in, 
lay it in the dish, and pepper it slightly. 
When the marrow is done, take it up carefully 
with a fish slice, lay it on the toast, pepper 
it well, and pour the butter over it. It should 
be served up as hot as possible. Prepared thus 
it is delicious.

(Haworth ) 
WHEAT-LEAVED FIG-MARIGOLD. 



There are certain succulent annual and 
biennial plants, whose flowers during hot 
bright summers light up the flower-garden 
with dazzling brilliancy in the clear sunny 
portions of the day. As summer ornaments 
of the greenhouse also, these plants are always 
welcome, their beauty in this case, likewise, 
being principally developed under the direct 
influence of the sun. The various species of 
Portulaca, of tDalandrinia, and the annual kinds 
of Mesembryanthemum serve as illustrations 
of the class of plants now alluded to. 

Among these, the Mesembryanthemum 
pyropmim, represented at the head of this 
article, holds no mean position. Under fitting 
circumstances it dev elopes a large proportion 
of floral beauty ; and though but an annual 
plant, and consequently of limited duration in 
a florescent state, compared with some peren- 
nial kinds, it is well worthy of cultivation, as 
it may be easily raised from seeds, and with 
but little difficulty a succession of lively 
blossom can be kept up through as much of 
the summer as may be desirable. 

The engraving represents the low tufted 
habit of the plant. Its entire height is not 
more than three or four inches, and indivi- 
dual plants do not often extend beyond six or 
eight inches in diameter, and are frequently 
of much less size, this of course depending 
altogether on the degree of vigour imparted 
to their constitution. The leaves are succu- 
lent or fleshy, rough with transparent warty 
excrescences, and of a linear obtuse half-terete 
form. The flowers are about an inch in 
diameter, and are formed of numerous narrow 
linear petals, blunt at the point, and arranged 
48. 



in a ray-like form around a centre of dark 
purple anthers ; they are not quite so evenly 
formed, however, as represented in the en- 
graving ; their colour is a lively rosy purple, 
white at the base, with a polished glittering 
surface, which adds greatly to the brilliant 
effect produced by the plants when in blos- 
som. There are two other forms, one with 
purplish, the other with white flowers. The 
species, which also sometimes bears the name 
of M. tricolor, ranks as a half-hardy annual, 
and, as such, is usually sown in pots, and 
when intended for the flower garden, planted 
out in spring along with other ''bedding out*' 
subjects. It has, however, been recorded to 
have sprung up from self-sown seeds, and 
may, therefore, be sown, if required, in the 
open border. 

Nearly the whole genus of Fig-marigolds 
are inhabitants of the hot arid tracts of the 
Cape of Good Hope, whence also Mesembry- 
anthemum pyr-opreum is derived. It is re*- 
corded as having been introduced about 1820, 
but is not even now commonly known. In 
the natural system of classification the genus 
is made the type of an order, to which the 
name of Mesembryacea3 has been applied. 
The genus contains upwards of three hundred 
recorded species, many of them plants of great 
beauty, and all of very easy culture. 

When intended for pot culture, in order to 
decorate the greenhouse during the summer 
months, the plants should be sown along with 
and receive the same kind of treatment as the 
other annual plants used for this purpose. 
Thus plants raised in March will be now 
(August) gaily adorned with their radian!

flowers. There may be some readers, how- 
ever, who are unfamiliar with the routine 
followed in rearing annuals for summer decora- 
tion, and to such a brief sketch of the details 
will be useful : — The seeds should be sown in 
well-drained light sandy soil, in shallow pots 
or pans, and these latter plunged in a gentle 
hotbed until the seeds germinate : being 
small, the seeds should not have more soil — 
which must be fine — covered over them than 
would equal the thickness of a shilling. For 
early blooming a few seeds may be sown in 
February, but for the principal set of plants 
the middle of March will be early enough, 
and for a later autumn supply, others may be 
sown in the middle of April. Seed-pots 
should not be often watered, nor must they 
be suffered to become dry ; of course, in the 
earlier parts of the season, the moisture of a hot- 
bed would prevent them from drying rapidly, 
but this is not the case later in the season, 
when "the sun becomes powerful : a very good 
plan to retain the necessary moisture, is to 
prevent rapid evaporation, by placing a layer 
of loose damp moss on the surface ; and this 
moss may be removed occasionally — daily, if 
necessary, — and damped, and then again re- 
turned. Coverings of this kind must, of 
course, be removed when the seeds begin to 
vegetate, and from this time the necessary 
moisture must be kept up by applications 
from a fine-rosed watering-pot, the water 
being always used in a tepid state. TYhen 
the plants have formed two or three leaves, 
they may then be transplanted, either singly 
into small pots, or three at equal distances 
near the edge of a five-inch one, a light sandy 
soil being used. The plants must then be 
allowed to become established in the same 
temperature as they had been formerly grown ; 
and after this may be removed to a cooler 
frame, where they may receive rather more 
air, to prevent them from becoming weak and 
spindly ; or, if the season be advanced, they 
may be at once placed on the shelves of the 
greenhouse : in either case, however, they 
must have all the sun and light possible, and 
must be sparingly, though carefully and suf- 
ficiently, watered. As they grow they may 
have larger pots, but never require them of 
very large size : for the single plants six-inch 
pots will suffice ; and the next larger size 
will be proper for those planted three to- 
gether. At this final shifting they should 
receive richer and more holding soil than 
before ; a compost of equal parts light turfy 
loam, and well decayed leaf mould — that is, 
soil formed of rotted tree leaves — mixed with 
a portion, more or less, of sand, to render it 
porous, and prevent its running together from 
repeated waterings, will form a suitable me- 
dium for their roots. In other respects, they 



need little attention beyond keeping them in 
a light sunny position, and supplying them, 
as they require, with libations of pure soft 
tepid water. 

When plants are required for the flower- 
garden, the seed should be sown in a similar 
way about the end of March ; in this case, 
also, the young plants should be transplanted, 
and it is best to have them all singly in small 
pots, as this admits of a more satisfactory ar- 
rangement of them in planting out. They 
must be well established in their pots, and 
then well hardened in cool and cold frames 
progressively, so that about the end of May, 
or as soon as danger of frosts is past, they 
may be inured to full exposure : they are 
then to be turned out of the pots into the 
situations assigned, just as is done in the case 
of other plants raised in a similar way. A 
warm sunny spot must be chosen for them, 
or their beauty will not be developed ; 
nothing is better than a slope facing the south, 
and well sheltered on other sides. They look 
extremely well in small beds, or as edgings to 
larger ones, and also among rock-work if the 
surface is not too rugged, for being but of 
small stature they are, in the case alluded to, 
too much hidden from view. Those who 
have not the convenience necessary thus to 
raise the plant, may grow it to almost — per- 
haps quite — as perfect a condition, by depo- 
siting the seeds at once in the soil of the 
flower-garden, in the positions where the 
plants are required to bloom. They will not 
transplant well from one part of the open 
garden to another, unless when very young, 
and they are then liable to many casualties if 
disturbed, so that it is best to sow the seeds 
where the plants are required ; only the 
warmest, dry, well drained spots must be 
selected ; and some attention should be given 
to render the soil fine, and to make it lie even 
about the seeds. The degree of success at- 
tained will depend on the character of the 
season. 

Seeds may in general be obtained of the 
dealers, but in the case of delicate subjects, 
such as the present, it is desirable to make 
certain of one's own supply, as well also some- 
times to obtain the means of supplying others. 
For seed-bearing it is best to select a few 
plants, and pot them as already explained, and 
then to place them for the summer in a frame, 
where they may have a free circulation of air, 
protection from rains, and exposure to light 
and sun heat. About half a dozen, or half a 
score of the seed vessels may be allowed to 
grow, and then the remainder of the flowers 
produced must be kept picked off. The re- 
tained capsules will give a supply of seed, 
which, v, hen ripe, must be carefully gathered, 
dried, and preserved. 






CONIFERS. THE PICEA, OR SILVER FIR. 




CONIFERS 

Picea, D. Don (the Silver Fir). — Derived 
from pix, in allusion to the pitch which the 
trees produce. Evergreen trees. 

Picea pectinata, Don (comb-leaved Silver 
Fir). — Leaves nearly flat, disposed in rows 
like the teeth of a comb, solitary, turned up 
at the points, on the upper side dark green, 
with two silvery lines underneath, whence the 
name of Silver fir. Cones large, cylindrical, 
erect, six to eight inches long, with blunt 
clo>ely-pressed scales of a brown colour when 
ripe. 

An erect growing noble tree, scattered over 
a great many countries, and long since praised 
by the prince of Latin poets for its unequalled 
beauty. It fills some of the forests of the 
Alps, the Carpathian mountains, the South of j country. 
Germany, the Uralian, Altaic, and Baikal 
mountains, and may be considered to be 
indigenous to the mountains of Central 
Europe, and those of the west and north of 
Asia. It assumes its most majestic appear- 
ance in Italy, in Germany, and especially in 
the neighbourhood of Strasburg, on low, deep, 
loamy lands, near to the Rhine. It is not to 
be found naturally in Scotland, and there is 
very little ground for supposing that it is a 
native plant in England. Its most celebrated 
locality is that of Olympus, the trees of this 
species contributing to form the noble woods 



Picea Pectinata. 

-The Picea, or Silver Fir. 

by which that famous seat of the gods is 
surrounded. 

The silver fir has been planted in consider- 
able numbers around gentlemen's seats, and it 
will be generally observed in such situations 
towering above all Other trees. When young, 
the tree is an exceedingly slow grower, often 
losing its leading bud from the effects of spring 
frost. In their young state the plants grow 
much better in Scotland than in England, and 
perhaps this is to be accounted for by the 
fact that there, when the tree is excited by 
fine weather to put forth its tender shoots, 
nipping frosts are by no means so common as 
in England, or, in other words, the climate 
is not so uncertain as it is in the latter 



Its love for deep loamy soil has very much 
operated against its being planted in this 
country in greater numbers ; for the land 
which suits it best is more profitably employed 
in growing corn crops, &c. Nevertheless, in 
all places where ornament is required it will 
continue to offer many attractions over some 
other evergreens. After it has attained to the 
age of ten or twelve years, it commences to 
grow rapidly, making annual shoots of from 
two feet to three feet in one season. 

Virgil was right in ascribing to it the attri- 
bute of beauty. It has nothing of the tortuous 



MO

ramification which forms the delight of the 
painter, nor is it calculated to elevate the 
mind when the winds are high, or during a 
storm: we hear not the shouting of the tempest ' 
in its lofty top. In the oak, for instance, the 
voice of Nature is loud and deep; but in all the 
individuals of the Coniferas there is only a 
shrill, hissing sound, which in minds attuned 
to such things, awakens a feeling of extreme 
solitariness. Its leaves are full of beauty, and 
will suffer the minutest examination ; its 
branches are disposed horizontally, and some- 
times may be observed at a great distance, 
and to advantage, against a clear sky. The 
trunk is straight and unbending, rising to a 
majestic height, and the tree altogether 
may be justly considered as one of those 
which adds dignity to the spot where it rises. 

The propagation and culture of this plant 
are accomplished much in the same way as 
in the common pine. The cones should be 
gathered in December, subjected to a very 
slight degree of kiln-drying, and then thrashed 
on a floor, as recommended in the case of the 
larch in a succeeding page. When sifted, and 
freed as much as possible from the broken 
pieces of the cones, &c, they should be kept 
in a dry place till the middle of March, and 
sown in beds of light loamy soil, placing the 
seeds so as that the plants may rise at about an 
inch apart from each other ; and this will be 
best insured by reckoning one seed out of 
every four as likely to vegetate. 

This, perhaps, will be better understood 
when it is stated that Silver fir seed is always 
bad, and requires to be sown very thick, in 
order to have a good close crop. In moist soil, a 
covering of half an inch will be sufficient, and 
in dry soils it may be increased to three- 
quarters of an inch, and even one inch. 
When the plants have been two years in the 
seed-bed, they may be transplanted into 
nursery lines, in the very richest soil that can 
be had, only it is not proper to use fresh 
manure. They should stand about two inches 
apart, in lines six inches asunder ; for, if 
planted at a greater distance apart, they will 
be found to make strong side branches, often 
robbing the leading shoot, which is, besides, 
very liable to injury by frost. It will be 
found worth while to insert dead branches 
(cut in summer, so as to retain their leaves,) 
throughout the lines : this will ward off the 
effects of spring frosts, and will be found 
to answer better than planting them under old 
trees, as is done in several nurseries in Surrey. 
Two years' seedlings are lO.y. per 1,000, and 
transplanted plants, nine inches high, are 
from 15.?. to 20s. per 1,000. Amongst the 
synonymes which are applied to this plant are 
P. taxi folia and P. excelsa. 

There are two varieties, one with twisted 



branches, called tortuosa, which, amongst 
painters, would be considered as preferable to 
the species; and another with variegated leaves, 
which cannot be depended upon as remaining 
true. There are plants of the former in the 
Exotic Nursery of Mr. Knight, and in Messrs. 
Loddiges' Arboretum, Hackney. 

Picea Nordmanniana, Loudon (Nordmann's 
Silver Fir). — Leaves broad-linear, obtuse, 
solitary, curved upwards, of unusual length, 
and of a silvery hue. Cones large, erect, 
ovate, growing either separately or in twos or 
threes, resinous, with obtuse scales, having 
obcordate reflexed bracts ; the seeds have a 
broad oblique wing. 

A noble tree, growing from eighty to a 
hundred feet high, w T ith smooth bark, and 
densely formed branches, the lower ones hori- 
zontal, the upper ones springing at a more 
acute angle. It is found in the north of Asia, 
at a considerable elevation (6,000 feet), and 
there is therefore no doubt as to its hardiness in 
this country ; but it has not been long intro- 
duced, and consequently the plants are but 
small. The leaves resemble those of P. grandis. 
It is a finer tree than the common Silver fir ; 
its silvery foliage and abundant cones giving 
it a distinctive appearance. When full grown 
it is said that the whole crown of the trees, for 
a fourth of their height, is covered with the 
cones. It was first met with by Professor Nord- 
mann on the summit of a mountain called 
Adshar. Being rare, it yet bears a high price. 

Picea ce/phalonica, Loudon (Cephalonian 
Silver Fir). — Leaves almost flat, shining, dark 
green on the upper side, with two obscure 
silvery lines underneath, almost sessile, dagger- 
shaped, somewhat resembling those of Arau- 
caria braziliensis. Cones erect, from six to 
eight inches long, slightly tapering, and about 
an inch and a half in diameter, with scales a 
good deal like those of P. pectinata. 

A fine tree, sixty feet high, introduced by 
General C. J. Napier, about the year 1824. 
Minutely considered, it has some resemblance 
to an Araucaria. Its general outline is like 
the Cedar, dense and spreading. It belongs 
to the Black Mountain of Cephalonia, or to 
what was, in classic times, Mount .iEnos, now 
Eno, and skirted Hebrus as it rolled towards 
the ^Egean over golden sands ! The ridge of 
mountains on which this tree grows is nearly 
5,000 feet above the sea, and about fourteen 
miles in length, lying in the direction of north- 
west and south-east. In Napier's Colonies, it 
is stated that a great part of this forest was 
burned down, but that it is still extensive, 
though materially injured by the goats, which 
are allowed to range at pleasure amongst the 
trees, biting off the leading shoots of the young 
ones. The same author states that when Count 
Mataxa, one of the nobles of the island, was 



CONIEERJE. THE PICEA, OR SILVER FIR.

presented to Napoleon, the emperor's first 
question was about the forest on the Black 
Mountain ; and, indeed, it appears to have 
formed a subject of the greatest interest to 
several of the governors. 

As a timber tree in this country, every 
thing known goes to prove that it may turn out 
to be valuable. There are already many good 
specimens scattered throughout the country, 
some of the finest of which are understood to 
be in the pinetum at Wolterton in Norfolk, 
Hendon Rectory, and Woburn Abbey. The 
earnestness with which this plant was made 
known by the late Mr, Loudon helped con- 
siderably to its introduction in pinetums and 
plantations : in his opinion, it forms " one of 
the most interesting and beautiful of the 
Abietinaa," and is in every way as worthy of 
being planted as an ornamental object as the 
Cedar of Lebanon. Plants are now within 
the reach of all, fine ones being only 2s. each. 

Picea Pichta, Loudon (Pitch Silver Fir). 
— Leaves short, thickly set, solitary, dark 
green. Cones erect, cylindrical, with entire 
cuneate-obovate scales, rounded at the apex. 

A variation only of P. pectinata, under 
which species it should have been treated. 
This variety is found in the forests on the 
Altaic Mountains, about 4,000 feet above the 
sea. It has been cultivated in the nurseries 
as a distinct species since 1820, and is even 
now sold at the rate of 2s. 6d. per plant. 
Lambert, Don, and others, recognise it only 
as the common silver fir. A specimen plant 
stands in the arboretum of the London Horti- 
cultural Society. 

Picea bahamea, Loudon (Balm of Gilead 
Pir). — Leaves rather flat, curved to the upper 
side, solitary, silvery beneath, and on the 
upper side of a bright dark green, nearly an 
inch in length. Cones erect, oblong, cylin- 
drical, of a purplish colour, with rounded 
undivided scales, the cone about four inches 
long. 

Pound, in an isolated state, in the colder 
parts of the United States, along with the 
black spruce, and deriving its name from a 
resemblance which its resin has to the Canada 
balsam,, or Balm of Gilead of the shops. It 
is a slendei", short-lived tree, remarkably beau- 
tiful when young, but fit only to be associated 
with shrubs and the smallest description of 
trees. It grows better in Scotland than in 
England, and in both countries prefers a deep 
sandy loam on the acclivity, or at the base of 
a hill. In its outline it resembles the Silver 
fir, but is by no means so apt to expend its 
strength in furnishing thick side branches ; 
nor is it so apt to lose its leading shoot. Its 
seeds, which are produced in this country, are 
treated in the same way as those of the Silver 
fir; and in the nurseries, two years old plants 



may be had at about 7s. 6d. per 1,000. On 
no account whatever should the young trees 
be subjected to pruning. The finest trees in 
England are at Woburn Abbey ; and at 
Syon and Chiswick Villa are specimens of 
about forty feet in height, beyond which alti- 
tude they rarely grow, even in their native 
abodes. 

Varieties. — There are two varieties in cul- 
tivation, one called jirostrata, of a bushy 
stunted habit ; and the other longifolia, with 
long leaves and upright spray. Both these 
varieties are cultivated in Knight's Exotic 
Nursery.! 

Picea Fraserii, Loudon (Fraser's Silver 
Fir). — Leaves like the foregoing, linear, some- 
what silvery underneath. Cones oblong, with 
a thick footstalk, squarrose. Bracteoles leafy 
and reflexed. 

A tree found on the mountains of Pennsyl- 
vania and Carolina, and introduced into this 
country by Mr. Fraser in 1811. Were it not 
for its cones, which are so much unlike those 
of P. balsamea, it might be classed as a 
variety of the latter tree. This distinctive 
difference, however, entitles it to be considered 
as a species. Mr. Lambert represents this tree as 
little better than a shrub, suited only to lawns 
and pleasure grounds, in situations where it is 
wanted to break particular lines, but not to 
interrupt the view. This estimate of its 
character is rather too humble, for in situations 
where the soil is favourable (a sandy loam), it 
grows with considerable vigour, making shoots 
of from one foot to eighteen inches in a season. 
In the climate of Scotland this plant is quite 
at home, and is there reported as making 
" annual shoots averaging fifteen inches. 
Whatever it may be as a timber tree, we do 
not regard it as more ornamental than the 
common Silver fir. The plants are perfectly 
hardy, having stood for several winters quite 
unprotected." The original tree is in the 
Hammersmith nursery ; young plants may be 
had at 3s. 6d. each (1846). 

Picea grandis, Loudon (great Californian 
Silver Fir). — Leaves long, fiat, narrow, green 
and shining on the upper, and silvery on the 
under side, blunt, and somewhat spreading. 
Cones erect, oblong, resembling in shape those 
of P. Webbiana, though smaller, six inches long, 
with broad entire scales of a chestnut brown 
colour. 

A noble object, from North-west America, 
somewhat akin to P. bahamea, but far out- 
stripping that tree, and many others, in state- 
liness. It was found by Douglas, and intro- 
duced by him in 1831. Its favourite seats are 
moist valleys, which it fills up with beautiful 
verdant piles, many of which are 200 feet high. 
The inferior quality of its wood is amply com- 
pensated for by its great height and rich garb of

green. What would Xerxes have said of such 
majestic objects ? However, we need no 
princes or sages of antiquity to awaken in us 
a due estimate of the overpowering grandeur 
of these works of the Almighty. There is a 
specimen in the garden of the Horticultural 
Society ; and though somewhat scarce in the 
nurseries, it is to be had at Loddiges' and 
Knight's at 5s. each (1346). 

Picea a a: ah <l/$, Loudon (lovely Silver Fir). 
— Leaves entire, flat, somewhat rounded at the 
apex, one and a quarter inch in length. Cones 
of a very regular shape, cylindrical, with short 
pointed bracteoles. Scales of a triangular shape, 
the upper side rounded, \\ inch broad, and 
the same in length. 

A beautiful and majestic tree, nearly allied 
to P. grandis, introduced by Uoiiglas in 1831. 
A good many plants were raised in the Chis- 
wick Garden and distributed to the members, 
so that the plant is found in many pinetums 
throughout the country. There are fine trees 
at Dropmore, Elvaston Castle, and in the 
Chiswick arboretum. Plants are 21s. each 
(1846). 

Picea ?iooilis, Loudon (noble Silver Fir). 
— Leaves almost all turned one way, thickly 
set on the branches, short, sharp, with a faint 
silvery colour underneath. Cones erect, cylin- 
drical, seven inches long, with imbricated 
bracteoles. Seed very small, measuring, with 
the wing, one and quarter inch in length. 

A majestic tree, discovered and introduced 
by Douglas, in 1831, forming extensive forests 
upon the mountains of Northern California, 
where it is said to produce timber of excel- 
lent quality. This is the tree which, above 
all others, awakened the admiration of Douglas. 
u I spent," he says, " three weeks in a forest 
composed of this tree, and, day by day, could 
not cease to admire it." Judging from the 
young trees at Belsay, Flitwick, and Hendon, 
it is likely to excite similar admiration in the 
less congenial climate of this country ; and it 
is not improbable that, at some future day, it 
will exhibit the beautiful and useful in a very 
eminent degree. Plants are 25s. each (1846). 
Picea religiosa, Loudon (sacred Mexi- 
can Silver Fir.) — Leaves linear acute, entire, 
somewhat pectinate, or comb-like, 1^ inch 
in length. Cones roundish-oval, nearly 3 inches 
long, and 21 inches broad ; they very much 
resemble those of the Cedar of Lebanon, but 
are smaller. 

A large growing tree, believed to be quite 
hardy in Britain. In a wild state, it grows 
from 100 to 150 feet in height, with a trunk 
5 or 6 feet in diameter. A native of Mexico, 
on the mountains of Anganguco, 8,000 or 
9,000 feet above the sea. It was introduced 
in 1839, by Mr. Hartweg, to the Horticul- 
tural Society of London. Like the Deodar 



among the Hindoos, this tree is greatly reve- 
renced throughout Mexico, where branches 
of it are used in decorating the churches. 
Plants. 18 inches high, are from 30s. to 42s. 
each (1846). 

Picea Webbiaha, Loudon (Webb's Silver 
Fir.) — Leaves linear, flat, two-rowed, crowded, 
smooth, shining, silvery beneath. Cones soli- 
tary, erect, 5 to 6 inches long, oblong, of an 
intense purple colour when ripe, but after 
being detached from the tree for some months, 
resembling in hue those of the Cedar of Le- 
banon, though somewhat darker. 

A fine tree, a native of the Alps of Gos- 
sainthan, and of the Himalayan mountains, 
where it was discovered by Captain W. S. 
Webb, and introduced into this country by 
Dr. Wallich, in 1822. It has a regular, 
majestic outline, which would indicate a loftier 
growth than it attains to even on its native 
hills, where it rises to the height only of 80 
or 90 feet. The branches, like those of the 
silver fir, are disposed in whorls, though less 
regular than in that tree ; the leaves are very 
thickly set, and its whole appearance entitles 
it to be considered as eminently beautiful. 
No decided opinion can be yet given of its 
use in this country as a timber tree : it suffers 
considerably from spring frosts, and, on that 
account often changes its leading shoot. 
Recent experiments, however, justify its being 
recommended in sheltered situations near to 
the sea, where the effect of frost is neutralized. 
In Scotland, too, it has a better chance of 
succeeding than in England ; and, indeed, 
throughout Britain, there is a source of hope 
regarding it, after it has become naturalized. 

Like the silver fir, it produces a great many 
bad seeds, and, on this account, it is scarcely 
worth while to send home the seeds in the 
cones. They should be extracted, and the 
good or plump ones selected and forwarded 
by the Overland route. Those who have 
friends in India, who are in the practice of 
sending cones to England, should be instructed 
to be very careful in getting those only of the 
current year's growth and from the trees ; 
for a great proportion of cones which reach 
Britain are evidently those which have fallen 
off prematurely, or are old ones gathered un- 
der the trees. Of all the countries under 
heaven, India is, perhaps, the slowest, and 
the natives are ever ready with an excuse to 
obviate the trouble of ascending a tree. The 
seeds should be sown in the first week of 
April, in the open air, like those of the com- 
mon pines, and treated in every respect like 
the Scotch rir or larch. One year seedling 
plants are 12s. per dozen ; and those 18 inches 
high, in pots, are from 7s. 6d. to 10s. each 
(1846).

leaved Silver Fir.) — Leaves in two rows, or 
nearly so, flat, and nearly of the same colour 
on both sides, bidentate at the apex, from 2 
to 3 inches long, having an elevated midrib. 
Cones erect, solitary, 5 inches long, of an oval 
obtuse form, and a greyish brown colour. 

A tree, growing to the height of 90 and 
100 feet, a native of the Himalayas, where 
it assumes the character, in some measure, 
of the Cedar of Lebanon, having stouter and 
more roaming branches than any other indi- 
vidual of the genus. In this respect it will 
find favour in the eyes of those who prefer 
picturesque growing trees, to those which are 
regular and pyramidal in their outline. The 
tree is not unfrequently confounded with 
P. Webbiana, but it may be easily distin- 
guished from the latter by its longer leaves, 
and by its cones, which are shorter and thicker. 
There is a good specimen in the arboretum 
of the Horticultural Society. One year seed- 
ling plants are 15s. per dozen; and those 
which are 15 inches high, are 21s. each 
(1846). 

Pieea bracteata, Loudon (leafy-bracted 
Silver Fir.) — Leaves linear, two -rowed, flat, 
silvery beneath, two inches long, light green, 
and shining on the upper surface. Cones 
ovate, four inches long, solitary, almost ses- 
sile, erect. 

A high slender tree, discovered by Douglas, 
on the high mountains of Colombia, and not 
growing at a lower elevation than 6,000 feet 
above the sea. It is a remarkable feature, 
that a tree affecting such an altitude should 
be so entirely devoid of that sturdiness pecu- 
liar to almost all other mountain trees ; its 
height being 120 feet, and the diameter of 



the stem at bottom only 15 inches. This 
fir will, no doubt, prove hardy in Britain, and 
produce valuable timber for some purposes. 
It is not yet, as far as we are aware, to be had 
in the nursei'ies of this country. 

Picea Pinsapo, Loudon (Mount Atlas 
Cedar, or Pinsapo Silver Fir.) — Leaves scat- 
tered, thick and fleshy at base, and tapering 
to a sharp point, dagger-shaped. Cones ovate, 
with bracts much shorter than the scales. 

A small tree very much resembling, in 
general appearance, P. balsamea, but by some 
regarded as a variety of P. pectinala. A 
remarkably slow growing plant when young, 
and not likely to prove otherwise than orna- 
mental in this country. A specimen, 18 inches 
high, stands in the arboretum of Mr. Mackie, 
Norwich. Plants, one foot high, are 12s. per 
dozen (1846). 

There are small plants of the following 
kinds in cultivation, but they are yet hardly 
enough advanced either to test if they are 
identical with other kinds already in culti- 
vation, or possessed of any peculiar charac- 
teristics: — P. Hudsonii, a very dwarf growing 
and small-leaved Silver Fir, the origin of which 
is unknown, price 15s. to 21s. each (1846). 
P. hybrida, a variety obtained in this country 
from Germany, slightly resembling P. Pichta 
in the colour of its foliage. Probably, these 
will prove to be merely varieties of the com- 
mon kind : both are in the collection of Messrs. 
Knight and Perry, of Chelsea. P. dianosa, 
represented to be hardy, cultivated by Messrs. 
Lawson and Son, and offered at 15s. each 
(1846). P. moustrosa, grown in the Exotic 
Nursery, King's Road : but Mr. Knight ex- 
presses considerable doubt concerning it. 



CONIFER^.— The Larix, or Larch Tree. 



Larix, Tournefort (the Larch), derived 
from the Celtic lav, fat, in allusion to its 
resinous exudation ; or, as others suppose, 
from the word Z/aris, the Berber name of a 
coniferous tree, found in Rif, and throughout 
the higher Sierras of Marocco. Deciduous 
trees. 

Larix europcea, Decandolle (European or 
common Larch.) -Leaves clustered, very soft, 
deciduous, rounded at the points, light green. 
Cones ovate-oblong, erect, one inch in length, 
of a dark brown colour when ripe, 



found in greatest perfection gi'owing in the 
neighhourhood of cataracts, avalanches, and 
ravines. Even, beside the icy glaciers of Savoy, 
where general vegetation never assumes its 
sway, some scattered specimens of it maybe seen 
skirting the outlines of that wondrous and 
appalling picture. On the Alps and Appe- 
nines, and generally over those countries 
where it is indigenous, it is found at a great 
height. The traveller, whilst journeying over 
the western and northern districts of Scot- 
land, may observe it, though not growing 



A well-known deciduous tree, with graceful J spontaneously, in similar situations, filling the 
pendent branches, naturally affecting cold and j straths with heavy timber, and ascending the 
elevated tracts of country, and when clad in its j mountains until it has attained an altitude too 
summer dress, considered to be an elegant I cold for it to live in. Those heights, it is true, 
object. In Alpine scenery, it is, perhaps, the \ are few in number ; for modern enterprise 



greatest of all trees. The most romantic and 
asonishing scenes in nature are clothed with it. 
In Italy, Switzerland, France, and Germany, it 
rises on mountains of uncommon height ; and is 



and ingenuity, by a simple process of inter- 
mixing the plants of the common pine with 
this tree, have succeeded in casting over the 
most sterile and exposed situations a lasting

and profitable vegetation. In summer time, 
it is delightful to witness the lively grassy- 
green hue of this tree, contrasted with the 
expanses of iron-coloured heath, which may be 
generally seen associated with it, and which 
apparently bid defiance to the inroads of the 
cultivator. 

Excepting the oak, and Scotch pine, no tree 
suited to the climate of Britain has proved 
itself of more general use. It is a fast grow- 
ing tree, not scrupulous as to where it is 
situated, and, though soon attaining to matu- 
rity, its wood is strong, tough, and imperish- 
able. Hence it is found to be a good substitute 
for the oak in ship-building. Throughout the 
sea-port towns of Russia, it is in constant de- 
mand, for the purpose of constructing line-of- 
battle ships ; and during the last twenty years, 
it has been frequently used in Scotland, in the 
building of brigs and frigates. It has been 
found to resist the effects of the extreme 
changes of climate, and, that most trying of 
all tests — the alternate exposure to air and 
water. It is found, again, to be of great ser- 
vice in the formation of railways, as supports 
to the rails, and as wood pavement, the former 
purpose being likely to absorb almost all the 
full-grown trees now existing in this country. 
In a smaller way, it is used for scaffolding- 
poles, ladders, pipes, shingles to cover the roof's 
of houses, vine props, posts for fencing, beams, 
lintels, joists, mill axles, and as hop-poles. 

But, whilst it is preparing itself for such 
useful purposes in commerce, &c, the great 
work which it accomplishes as a fertilizer of 
waste land, renders it an object particularly 



worthy of being introduced in all barren and 
unprofitable districts. That a tree should thus 
carry fertility along with it, and that at the 
same time there should be still so much space 
throughout Britain, upon which it is not 
allowed to operate, can be only accounted for 
by the fact, that its effects in this respect are 
not generally known. Be this as it may, we 
know from experience, that a better agent for 
subjugating tracts of heath land cannot be. 
When planted, so as that the branches touch 
one another, the air during summer is excluded 
to that degree, that the heath, and whatever 
coarse herbage may be upon the land is des- 
troyed ; and when the trees are thinned, so as 
to admit sufficient air to the surface, it is soon 
clad with certain species of delicate grasses, 
known to botanists as of the genera Festuca, 
Cynosurus, Agrostis, Poa, &c. This fact 
was first noted and acted upon by the Duke of 
Athol ; but the practice has since been im- 
proved by Mr. Gorrie, of Annat Gardens, 
Perthshire, who, with his relative, Mr. A. 
Gorrie, of Holkham, stand pre-eminent as in- 
dividuals who have paid the closest practical 
attention to the Larch in all its bearings. The 
former gentleman recommends the seeds of 
Poa nemoralis to be scattered over the 
ground after removing the first thinnings, as 
that grass, he says, " wonderfully improves the 
pasturage." 

Pictorially considered, the Larch is deficient. 
It is without grandeur ; and though it may be 
seen occasionally assuming an irregular and 
even noble outline, such a character belongs 
not to the species. It will, however, continue to

be a favourite with many on account of its 
tender green verdure in April and May, and 
the beauty of its catkins. It is one of the first 
to awake at the call of spring ; and that cir- 
cumstance alone will always ensure for it a 
favourable notice. The whole sum of it is 
this : — could it be removed, out of sight in 
June, it would form during the two preceding 
months a most lovely lawn ornament ; but, 
taken altogether, it is much more useful than 
ornamental, and fit only for far-off scenes, in 
poor soils, where alone it can be profitably 
employed. 

The rearing of the Larch is in many re- 
spects similar to that of the common Scotch 
pine. The cones are fit to be gathered in the 
month of December, and many are the plans 
adopted to get at the seeds which they con- 
tain. Boring them with a gimlet, and split- 
ting them with an awl, practices which are 
adopted by some, are tedious and tiresome 
operations scarcely worthy of notice. The 
proper way is to lay them upon wood in a 
kiln, for twelve or fifteen hours, turning them 
over three times during the day, and subject- 
ing them to heat, not exceeding 110 degrees 
Fahr. The cones will not expand so as to let 
the seeds fall out, as in the case of the Scotch 
pine, but the heat will render them much 
easier to break. They should then be laid in 
a thick ridge upon an uneven stone floor, 
resembling causeway, and beat to pieces with 
a flail. All those who know any thing of the 
operation of threshing these cones, will readily 
sanction the statement that it forms the 
hardest of all manual labour. Care should be 
taken to keep the cones thick enough upon 
the floor to protect the seeds from the stroke 
of the flail ; and when this is done, it is sur- 
prising how few of them are bruised. Every 
two or three hours the cones should be sifted, 
and laid down afresh to undergo the operation 
as before ; and so on till all the seeds are ex- 
tracted. It will be found impossible to sepa- 
rate the seeds from the broken pieces of cones 
by any process of winnowing, the latter being 
of the same size and weight as the former : 
hence it is, that pure and unmixed seed, in 
any large quantity, cannot be procured. 

The time for sowing the seed is about the 
end of April : in Scotland, where spring frosts 
might prove hurtful, it is deferred till the 
second week in May ; and the operation is in 
all respects the same as that adopted for the 
common pine. The soil should, if possible, be 
light and friable, such as will not get crusted 
after rain ; and, for the convenience of weed- 
ing the beds, they should not exceed 4| feet 
in width. In those beds, the plants may re- 
main either one or two years according to 
their size : a luxuriant crop, or such of the 
plants as have made a good growth, will be fit 



for transplanting into nursery lines at the end 
of the first season ; but in many cases, they 
are allowed to remain till they have completed 
their second season. When two years ^old, 
the plants are fit to take their station where- 
ever they are to remain, if the heath or 
herbage should be short and meagre ; but in 
all cases where the surface is matted, or much 
shaded, plants from nursery lines, of a larger 
size, should be used. In the event of a good 
close crop, the plan which is generally adopted 
is to weed out all the largest of the plants the 
first autumn or spring after sowing, leaving 
the remainder for a crop of two years' seed- 
lings ; and the advantages of this process are, 
that the plants may be sold or used twelve 
months sooner than those which remain ; and 
that those which are yet in the beds run no 
risk of being drawn up or choked by being too 
thick. 

There are two ways of planting the Larch, 
namely, by pitting them, and planting them 
with the hand iron. The former plan is 
adopted in plantations of limited extent, where 
large, and consequently, bushy-rooted plants 
are required ; and consists simply of small 
pits, eighteen inches deep, being made with 
the common garden spade. The other is the 
most expeditious yet in practice, and is but in- 
differently understood in England. It is appli- 
cable to all waste lands where the surface is 
bare, or partially so, and is performed by 
making a cut in the ground with a small spade 
worked by the right hand ; whilst the left is 
employed in inserting the plant, which is 
firmly fastened in its position by treading 
with the heel. (See Annals of Horticulture, 
1845, p. 188.) 

Strictly speaking, this tree requires no 
pruning : the stem should of course be cleared 
of all the under branches as they become de- 
cayed, but not until they are so useless as sap 
agents, that there can be no fear of the tree 
bleeding at the parts where the branches are 
detached. The time for felling is winter ; 
and as the roots make excellent fuel, it is re- 
commended that they should be either removed 
with the stem, or afterwards dug up. 

By far the most important point connected 
with the treatment of the Larch is the defect 
or disease, known as the rot, which, as Loudon 
truly observes, " has baffled every attempt of 
physiologists and planters to ascertain its 
cause." He therefore leaves the subject as he 
found it. The details which have been written 
concerning the supposed causes of this disease 
would fill a goodly octavo volume ; and as it 
would be useless to repeat even an abstract of 
them here (for they lead to no good end), 
the writer will simply detail the real cause 
and cure of this most serious evil. Amongst 
all the opinions delivered, the nearest approach 



SiG 



CONIFER.E. — THE LARIX, OR LARCH TREE. 



to the truth is that by Mr. Gorrie, and in 
these words, which are a commentary on 
Matthews's plaD of probing the roots of the 
Larch, and laying bare those fitted for knees in 
shipbuilding : — " Cutting the roots of a grow- 
ing Larch is dangerous, and will inevitably pro- 
duce rot ! " 

This, however, as the sequel will show, is 
short of the real cause. "When a Larch plant 
springs from the seed, it sends down a long 
tapering or tap root, in shape resembling a 
carrot or parsnip, so that if a seedling one 
year old be carefully taken up, it will be found 
to have a long leading root, furnished all the 
way with small minute fibres — quite a carrot 
root in miniature. To say that the part of 
the plant at the surface of the soil, and the 
whole length of the top must have the closest 
connexion and sympathy with the root just 
described, is only repeating what every one 
must see to be indisputable. Well, this plant 
is taken up, its root shortened with the pru- 
ning knife to within a few inches of the stem, 
or if not touched with the knife, it is other- 
wise compelled by frequent transplantation to 
give vp its tap root. It strives to regain it ; 
but no : the tree is removed again, and after 
many shiftings, all trace of the leading root is 
lost ; and in the language of nurserymen, 
it is at last furnished with "fine fibrous or 
matted roots." The tiny seedling commenced 
with a good foundation : the first thing it did 
was to send its root deep into the soil — a 
root of iron — the same rigidity of fibre per- 
vading its upward growth. Now, will any 
one say, that at the end of four or five years 
after its many shiftings, this hardy constitu- 
tion bas not suffered violence ? The heart of 
the stem, during its first year's growth, was 
formed and fostered by the tap root ; and 
when that is lost, it is only natural to conclude 
that the centre should, in many instances, 
decay also. It will scarcely do to say that the 
side or fibrous roots will administer the same 
nourishment to the tree, inasmuch as the 
infant stem was part and parcel of the tap 
root, which, under the common process, the 
plant is compelled to relinquish. It is true, 
the common mass of fibrous roots will support 
the plant, which, in all appearances, flourishes 
as before : they perform their office, but they 
nourish only a living sepulchre, worthless for 
aught, except shelter and show. 

Where is the analogy to all this ? Why, 
experience teaches us that frequent transplan- 
tation has a tendency to subdue and soften the 
rigidity of fibre, which all young trees possess : 
in the case of the crab tree, it lessens the 
sharpness and sourness of its fruit ; and it is 
well known that in Spain and Portugal, where 
large plantations of the chestnut are made, the 
practice of frequently shifting the trees is 



resorted to, for the purposes both of checking 
their growth, and freeing the nuts from that 
woody taste which they otherwise have. It 
ameliorates and subdues the wildness of their 
native character, and it must have a corre- 
sponding effect on the texture of their timber. 
All this, then, is accomplished by the destruc- 
tion of the main or tap root. A somewhat 
analogous instance may be drawn from animal 
physiology. Take the tooth. Physiologists 
tell us that " hard and resisting as the teeth 
appear, they are, nevertheless, endowed with 
the same vital properties as other parts ; and 
the root of each is perforated longitudinally 
by a small canal, through which the blood- 
vessels and nerve are admitted into its internal 
structure. From those blood-vessels the tooth 
derives its nourishment." The main, or tap 
root of a tree may, with some propriety, there- 
fore, be considered as the nerve of the plant, 
which, if damaged, causes that decay which 
the side roots are insufficient to ward off. 

But, lest these analogies should prove to be 
but fancied ones, let us look only at facts. In 
the self-sown plantations of Blair, Ballindal- 
loch, Relugas, and Altyre, where the trees 
were never transplanted, and where the tap 
root is uninjured, the disease is unknown : 
and further, so far as I can ascertain, it bas 
not discovered itself in those districts where one 
and two years seedlings have been used in 
trenched soil. It appears therefore, that plan- 
tations of larches should, if possible, be sown 
where the plants are intended to remain ; that 
it is better to use one year seedlings than those 
which are two years old ; and again, that two 
years old plants are to be preferred to those 
which are taken from nursery lines. It is not 
intended to be said that every one or two 
years seedling larch, even in soil which has 
been loosened to the depth of two feet, will 
produce a tree free from the rot : such plants 
may receive injuries which cannot be over- 
come ; and it is equally clear that many of 
those which have been often shifted may yet 
retain the original root, or at least the power 
of forming to themselves new tap roots. Al- 
together, the subject is important beyond 
example, and deserves the closest attention. 
One year seedling plants are Is. 6d. per 1000 ; 
two years old plants are 3s. 6d. per 1000 ; 
and transplanted plants are from 10s. to 20s. 
per 1000 (1846). 

Varieties. — These are numerous, and some 
of them well entitled to be cultivated as 
curious and ornamental. L. europcea, how- 
ever, is the only one claiming consideration as 
a timber tree. 

L. e. pendula (weeping Larch). — A very 
distinct variety discovered amongst plants 
raised from seeds sent from the Tyrol. It is 
much more robust than the American weeping 



CONIFERS. THE LARIX, OR LARCH TREE.

Larch, its branches being thicker and longer, 
and its cones considerably larger. Plants 
5 feet high, are 2s. 6d. each (1846). 

L. e. pendvla repens. — A variety of the 
foregoing, with less of the drooping character 
in it. It is propagated in the London nurse- 
ries and sold at 4.*. per dozen (1846). 

L. e. sibirica( Siberian Larch). — A variety 
sent by Professor Pallas to the Hackney nur- 
sery about the beginning of the present cen- 
tury, and since discovered in the Duke of 
Atliol's plantations amongst plants raised from 
seeds received from Archangel. Hence, in 
some catalogues, it bears the name of L. 
europcea archangelica. It is common on 
the sides of the Ural Mountains, and extends 
noi'thwards through Siberia and Kamtschatka 
to the Pacific Ocean. In the south of Siberia, 
it assumes the dimensions of the European 
tree. In budding and leafing, it is con- 
siderably in advance of the common tree, or 
any other of its varieties ; but its catkins do 
not expand till late in the season. It has 
been tried in Scotland as a timber tree ; but 
it has with justice given place to L. europcea, 
which grows with greater rapidity, and in a 
shape infinitely more serviceable as respects 
its timber. Plants, in pots, are at the high 
price of Is. each (1846). 

L. e. dahurica (Dahurian Larch). — A 
worthless variety discovered in Dahuria, flat- 
headed, irregular, and stunted : many of the 
same sort might be selected from plantations 
in England. A scrubby, unsightly plant of 
the same kind stands on the property of Lord 
Stafford, near Cossey village. Plants are 4d. 
each (1846). 

L. e. laxa (loose-headed European Larch). 
— Not seen by the writer, but described by 
Lawson as " more horizontal and less crowded 
in its branches, with a darker green, or some- 
what glaucous colour of foliage," than the 
common tree. Plants, \\ foot, are 4s. per 
dozen (1846). 

L. e. compacta (compact-branched Larch). 
— A very distinct variety, discovered by Mr. 
G-orrie of Annat Gardens, a gentleman who 
has bestowed more attention upon the Larch 
than any other person in Britain. In habit, 
t his plant is represented as being conical in its 
outline, like the common larch, with brittle, 
horizontal branches, erect towards the point. 
The bark is thick and rugged. Cones nearly 
as large as those of the common tree, with 
blunter points, equally persistent, and with 
scales remarkably smooth. The leaves are of 
a light grassy-green colour, and so long as 
they continue fresh, the tree is very orna- 
mental. Of its qualities as a timber tree, no 
favourable opinion has been hazarded. Plants, 
2 feet high, are 4s. per dozen (1846). 

L. e. intermedia (intermediate Larch), 



belongs to L. e. sibirica, though some bota- 
nists think there is an appearance exhibited 
by it entitling it to be considered distinct. It 
awakes at the very first approach of spring, 
and consequently suffers from after frosts. 
Plants, 2 feet, are 4s. per dozen (1846). 

Other varieties of the common Larch have 
been selected by the curious, and even the 
minute differences in the flowers have given 
rise to two individuals, namely, L. e. jiore 
rubro, with red flowers, and reddish-brown 
cones ; and L. e. jiore alba with whitish 
flowers, and cones of a very light colour. 
L. e. Killermaniana is also to be found in 
catalogues at 7s. 6d. each. 

Larix americana, Michaux (American 
Larch). — Leaves short, clustered, deciduous, 
flexible. Cones oblong, erect, green in spring 
time, and becoming brown or violet coloured, 
from |in. to fin. long, the scales gradually 
diminishing from the base to the top. 

A native of cold mountainous districts in 
Vermont, New Hampshire, and the district of 
Maine. Near Lake St. John, and the Lakes 
of Misstassin, it forms deep and unbroken 
forests ; and its extreme limits, towards the 
south, are New Jersey and Pennsylvania, 
where it is only found in the coldest and 
gloomiest exposures. Again, in Lower Jersey 
and in the neighbourhood of New York, it is 
very scarce, and seen occasionally intermingled 
with the white cedar. When grown in Ame- 
rica, the wood is reckoned equal to that of the 
common larch as grown in this country ; but 
in Britain the American tree does not succeed 
well, and has fallen into the rank of an orna- 
mental tree only. Plants, 6 feet high, are Is. 
each (1846). 

Varieties. L. a. rubra (red American 
Larch). — A native of North America, of a 
middle size, very much resembling in its out- 
line the common European larch, from which, 
however, it is readily distinguished by its 
small purplish cones. The tree has a smooth 
brown bark, with horizontal, or somewhat 
drooping branches ; and the leaves are shorter 
and narrower than those of the common tree. 
It has been tried along with other coniferous 
trees in the plantations at Blair Athol, but 
found to be remarkably deficient for econo- 
mical purposes. What little wood it produces, 
however, is very close-grained and heavy. 
Plants, 2 feet high, are Is. 6d. each (1846). I 

L. a. pendula (pendulous-branched, or 
black Larch). — A native of North America, 
where it grows on mountainous districts 
where the soil is free, and on low meadow 
lands, in rich clay, or deep sandy loams. This 
is the most graceful of all the larches, the 
leading shoot frequently assuming its pen- 
dulous outline at the height of 20 feet from 
the ground ; and as Lindley observes, " it

forms a natural arch of great beauty." It is 
rather singular that this tree, which has been 
in Britain for upwards of a century, should not 
be found more frequently in pleasure grounds 
as an ornamental object. Plants of this variety, 
2 feet high, are 2s. each (1846). 



L. a. prolifera. — A specimen bearing this 
name stands in the arboretum of the Horti- 
cultural Society at Chiswick — no doubt a 
mere continuation by grafting of some curious 
monstrosity. The tree which is growing in 
the Society's Garden is about 20 feet high. 




HELICHRYSUM PROSTRATUM. 

Dr. J. D. Hooker. 
THE PROSTRATE HELICHUrSUM. 



One of the plants of which a figure is given 
in Dr. Hooker's splendid work, the Flora 
Antarctica, is the Helichrysum prostratum, 
represented in the annexed figure, reduced 
from the plate given in that work. It is one 
of the neatest, if not the gayest, of the plants 
of the Antarctic flora. 

It is a graceful and very elegant plant, with 
decumbent branching stems, small elliptic- 
obovate, or obovate-spathulate, obtuse, scat- 
tered leaves, and flowers of a pure white, or 
faintly tinged with rose colour, and nearly an 
inch across. The flowers, it will be seen, 
grow terminally at the ends of the shoots, and 
being pretty freely produced, they have a gay 
appearance. The plantispeculiar among its con- 
geners for its prostrate or decumbent habit, 
which, however, renders it very suitable for 
planting on rock-work. The stems are leafy 
throughout, and irregularly furnished with 
divaricating branches, which turn upwards at 
tlie tips, where they produce their solitary 
flowers. The leaves, which are from a quarter 
of an inch to a third of an inch long, are 
covered beneath with a silvery tomentum, or 
downy substance, and on the upper surface 
with scattered silky hairs. 

It has been gathered both in Lord Auck- 
land's and in Campbell's Island, in the former 



confined to rocks at the top of the hills. In the 
more southern islands, it grows abundantly, 
trailing over the rocks and banks near the sea. 
Dr. Dieffenbach found it on Mount Egmont, 
in the northern part of New Zealand, where 
it was growing at an altitude of 4,000 feet 
above the sea. There cannot, therefore, be 
any doubt of its capacity to bear the cold of 
the climate of England : some experiments 
would however be necessary in order to ascer- 
tain if the moisture of our climate would 
destroy it. 

This is one of the plants which those who 
have communications with the countries it 
inhabits, should endeavour to introduce to 
this country. Being a composite plant, there 
is no doubt it pi'oduces plenty of seed, by 
means of which there would be little difficulty 
in raising it. Obviously, the situation where 
it would be most appropriately placed, under 
cultivation, would be where it would be ex- 
posed as far as possible to the pure free air. 
The plant seems to bloom pretty freely, but 
we have no means yet of determining what 
would be its flowering season in this country. 
From its habit, we may judge it to be a plant 
which would continue a considerable time in 
bloom. It 'should be planted in well drained 
and somewhat sandy soil, containing loam.

THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 

So?ii borecole, cabbages, cauliflower, carrot, 
cress, endive, lettuce, Lamb's lettuce, onions, 
parsley, peas, radishes, rape, red cabbage, 
salading, spinach, and turnips. 

Plant and Transplant balm, borecole, 
brocoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cole- 
worts, endive, lettuce, and savoy. 

General Directions. — Close the general 
winter cropping, gather in and dry herbs and 
seeds of all kinds, also onions, shalots, and 
such like. Hoe and earth up the growing 
c-ops, and apply clear liquid manure often : 
still clear, dig, or trench every empty space, 
and let it be occupied by some useful 
vegetable different in constitution from that 
which grew there before, by which means, 
none of the ground need be left " fallow," or, 
in other words, wasted. 

Balm maybe readily increased by division of 
the roots ; it grows in any common garden soil. 

Borecole. — A little seed may now be sown, 
for very late planting ; plant out ; hoe 
amongst the previous planting. 

Brocoli. — Plant out such as the Tartarian 
(late), which will come in next May; also from 
the other late sorts : give them a fresh, rich, 
and loamy soil, or dig deep and dung well : 
prepare for another planting early next month . 

Cabbages. — Sow for the principal spring 
crops, the second week, in an open situation ; 



and 



suc- 



if very dry weather prevails the seed beds 
may be watered : each sort should be sown 
distinct, and labelled accordingly. Plant out 
a few more any time this month in a rich soil, 
for coleworts. 

Carrots. — To obtain them young, and early 
in spring, sow this month in a deep, open, 
and rich soil ; choose a calm day for sowing, 
as the seeds are very light ; put them in rows 
a foot apart. 

Cauliflower. — Sow now for the early sum- 
mer crop ; some are particular to a day, and 
prefer the 24th : give it a good situation and 
a bed of rich light earth. Attend to the 
advancing crops in cutting, clearing, 
hoeing in time. 

Celery. — Continue to plant out for 
cession : earth up those which require it, 
observing to keep the earth from the heart, 
and not to do it too often. Waterings with 
liquid manure will now be beneficial, but do 
not saturate the soil. 

Coleworts. — Plant out the strongest from 
the early cabbage beds, at a distance of four- 
teen inches each way. 

Cress. — Sow twice, or oftener, this month, 
in a shady situation. 

Endive. — Sow the first week for a late win- 
ter crop : plant out those sown last month, and 
hoe between those planted early ; give all a 
good situation and a rich open soil. 

Herbs of all sorts should be cut on a dry 
day, and hung up in small bundles, or spread 
out in an airy place to dry. To secure them 
in the best state, cut them when the flowers 
begin to open.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR AUGUST. 



Kidney Beans must be hoed amongst, and 
the tall sorts staked : the dwarf sorts will be 
better for being earthed up. Those which 
are ready for gathering should be taken off, 
whether required for use or not, as the 
strength of the plant goes to mature them, if 
they are left on : it is well to leave a few 
by and by for seeds. 

Leehs. — Hoe amongst these, and draw a 
little earth about their stems ; do not follow 
the common practice of cutting the leaves. 

Lettuce. — Sow about the middle of the 
month to stand the winter : the Hammersmith, 
brown Dutch, and brown cos, also the green 
cos and imperial cabbage, are the best hardy 
sorts. Plant, or thin out from the late sowings 
for autumn use. 

Lettuce (Lamb's) or corn salad. — Sow this 
month in very common soil, and rather a 
shady situation; it will be found useful in 
winter. 

Onions. — Sow the first week for a full 
winter crop ; they must have a rich, deep, and 
fresh soil, and a good place, and should be 
sown in drills a foot apart. Watch the pro- 
gress of the spring crops, and gather and lay 
them in a dry place (before storing) as they 
ripen. 

Parsley. — A large sowing should be made 
as early as possible. Thin out the sowings 
made in June, leaving the most curled plants. 

Parsnip. — It will be beneficial to go over 
them anew, and see that they are not left 
too thick ; suffer no weeds to grow. 

Peas. — Discontinue sowing unless it be 
upon a very warm spot. Stake the advancing 
crops in time, and top them when about three 
feet in height : give them thorough waterings 
as recommended if the weather is dry ; also 
soak the seed in water, before sowing. 

Radish. — Sowings for winter or late in 
autumn should be made about the middle of 
the month ; either the black Spanish or the 
queen radish are suitable : sow early for 
succession, and the quicker they grow the 
more crisp and better they will be. 

Rape. — Sow; transplant, if sown last month, 
about two feet apart ; it is very hardy, and 
forms a substitute for mustard. 

Red Cabbage. — Sow beside the others ; they 
need not be transplanted until the spring, as it 
is not used until the head is large and firm. 

Salading, as mustard, &c. must still be 
sown every fortnight or so; it will keep in 
use longer if grown in a shady place. 

Scarlet Runners. — Allow none of the old 
pods to remain unless wanted for seed, as they 
do not then bear half so many fit for using. 

Savoy. — It is almost too late to plant out, 
except in good situations ; if done, do it early. 

Spinach. — Sow early in rows a foot apart, 
for a main winter crop; the prickly is best. 



Turnip. — Another sowing can still be made; 
the white stone or a superior early sort is to 
be preferred : thin out, and hoe, the earlier 
sowings. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Be indefatigable in 
preserving the ripe and ripening fruit from 
the attacks of vermin ; the net, the bottles, 
the mats, &c, the watchful eye and ready 
hand, must all be in active operation, even to 
the removing of the causes, of which perhaps 
the early and extensive destroying of wasps, 
nests is not the least effective : dare we say 
kill the birds also ? The training and thin- 
ning both of wood and fruit may still be neces- 
sary and beneficial. Examine newly budded 
trees, and perfect the ties when required : also 
take away all suckers and superfluous shoots 
that would draw nourishment from the bud. 

Apricots. — A few may ripen at the end of 
the month, and only those must be gathered ; 
avoid touching those which are not ready. 
Slugs are sometimes troublesome, and must be 
destroyed at night. 

Cherries. — See that the nets used for pro- 
tecting the fruit from birds are whole : it 
i3 not well to gather all at once, but go regu- 
larly over, taking only those ripe : when the 
crop is cleared well wash the trees. 

Currants. — About the end of the month, 
it may be necessary to mat up a i'aw of the 
best bushes, both for kitchen and dessert use : 
choose a perfectly dry day, and make the mats 
quite close ; standards, espaliers, or wall- 
trained trees, are most readily preserved in 
this way. 

Figs. — Remove any crude shoots that may 
now appear, and use every proper means of 
ripening the fruit quickly ; do not take off 
many of the leaves, but the wood may be much 
thinned. 

Gooseberries. — Mat up the good keeping 
sorts, such as the "Warrington and Iron- 
monger ; the bushes must be quite dry. 
It may be necessary to net over the whole, 
where birds are plentiful. 

Nectarines. — Finally thin and nail in the 
shoots, removing all late growths, and it may 
be, a few over-strong shoots where too much 
crowded ; this will assist the ripening of the 
fruit, and what is not less important, the 
ripening of the wood. 

Peaches. — Treat the same as nectarines. 
Expose the fruit to the sun ; but whilst no 
leaves must be removed where they will not 
easily shed, the half of the leaf may be cut 
away. 

Pears. — Again remove the breast-wood 
and any after-growths or blossoms, so as to 
conduct all the strength to the fruit and next 
year's wood. Let none of the leading shoots, 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR AUGUST. 



351 



especially of young trees, be injured from in- 
attention to nailing, or otherwise securing 
them ; a windy night might ruin them. 

Plums. — These are very unequal in ripen- 
ing, and require to be often looked over : 
some will now be required for kitchen use ; 
these, if taken off with care, may assist those 
to be kept for dessert. 

Raspberries. — The young canes, if strong 
and likely to suffer from wind, should be tied 
up : the fruit for preserving must be gathered 
on a dry day. 

Strawberries. — Lay them in pots, if re- 
quired ; and at an early period cut off the 
runners, and plant them, if wanted, in nursery 
beds for new plantations. Those potted early 
for forcing, should be set in a hot dry place to 
ripen them. 

Vines. — Do not leave a shoot that is not 
required, and give the bunches and berries a 
final and good thinning. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Fire heat may in 
nearly every case be dispensed with, except 
in the fruiting pine pit, and in these cases it 
must be very moderate. Renew linings to 
hotbeds where required. Continue the rou- 
tine operations of July. 

Cherries. — The house must stand fully open, 
or if the plants are in pots or tubs, or there 
is any way of getting them out, it would 
answer the same end, of resting them, and 
their place might be filled with growing 
plants. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature from 60 to 
90 degrees. Provide now plants for a winter 
stock ; they may be obtained either by cut- 
tings, layers, or seeds, but will bear soonest 
from layers. Get suitable soil prepared for 
them, and placed in readiness where they are 
to be planted ; there is nothing better than 
fresh turfy loam, with about a third of leaf- 
mould. Water the bearing plants with 
liquid manure, and keep them clean and regu- 
larly thinned : fumigate often and shut up 
early. 

Figs. — Temperature from 55 to 75 degrees. 
Withhold watering entirely ; it may be ne- 
cessary to sponge over the leaves to kill the 
red spider. The good forcing sorts should 
be increased now by cuttings or suckers. 

Melons. — Temperature from 65 to 90 de- 
grees. Maintain a brisk heat by means of 
linings, yet if the sun heat is economized, as 
it were, by early closing in the day, little or 
no artificial heat is requisite ; shut up early 
therefore, but give plenty of air to those ripen- 
ing. Water only in the mornings, and not 
over the foliage ; thin the shoots and slightly 
stir and freshen up the surface of the soil. 

Miishroovis. — Temperature from 55 to 60 



degrees. Keep the house or cellar, or where- 
ever they are grown, dark. If the early 
directions were attended to, young mush- 
rooms should soon be making their appear- 
ance in the old cucumber or melon beds ; these 
may still be made available for that end, by 
taking off the soil all but two inches, thrust- 
ing in spawn at six inches apart amongst 
the dung, shutting up the frame, and shading 
with mats ; a good crop may thus be expected 
in due time. 

Musas. — Temperature from 65 to 90 de- 
grees. Always maintain plenty of moisture 
about the growing plants, but keep those 
whose fruit is ripening, dryish : shift the ad- 
vancing suckers as their appearance directs ; 
give a rich loamy soil, and water with liquid 
manure, when the roots are strong and touch- 
ing the edges of the tubs. 

Nectarines and Peaches. — Temperature 
from 55 to 80 degrees. The trees in the early 
houses must be syringed if the least dirty ; 
keep them exposed, unless the wood requires 
ripening. The late houses must have air and 
water as before ; withholding the latter en- 
tirely when the fruit is ripening, and there 
! giving air night and day. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature from 65 to 90 

| degrees. Many of the fruit will now be cut, 

' and a general re-potting of the young plants 

I and suckers may take place ; the suckers are 

strengthened by remaining for a time on the 

old stool. On the Hamiltonian system they 

are allowed to remain attached, and the soil 

is brought up about them, whereby they are 

induced to root freely ; of course they are all 

planted out in a prepared bed of soil. Equal 

success attends both plans when due attention 

is bestowed. Where there is a brisk heat, 

airing at night is commendable. 

Strawberries. — Those plants which are be- 
ing prepared for forcing should be put early 
into six-inch pots and placed close together, 
or plunged at the foot of a south wall, where 
they will become fully matured early in the 
autumn ; and this is no small advantage for 
the earlier crops. 

Vinery. — Temperature from 65 to 85 de- 
grees. Where the fruit is ripening keep the 
house dry and airy. The growing house must be 
moist and free of draughts. The houses for 
early forcing must be thrown open, or the 
vines taken out. Attend, where necessary, to 
thinning, stopping, and keeping clean. The 
late houses must not be too much retarded, as 
cold will and does cause a stagnancy of the 
" circulating medium," which results in stone- 
less berries, rust, and unripened wood. It is 
well to do without syringing in the late vine- 
ries where little fire heat is required ; the 
necessary moisture may be maintained by 
damping the floor, walls, &c.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR AUGUST. 



FLOAVER GARDEN AKD SHRUBBERT. 

Sow for planting out and early spring flower- 
ing, such annuals as clarkia, collinsia, coreop- 
sis, Oenothera, nemophila, gilia, &c. ; they 
will do well on a warm border in a light sandy 
soil. Biennials and perennials may also be 
sown. 

Plant and Transplant biennials, also a 
few annuals for late flowering, and shrubs of 
all sorts if required. 

General Directions. — Every place being 
now filled must be kept, as respects neatness 
and cleanliness, in a superior style, to impart 
the desired gratification ; both choice flowers and 
skilful arrangement would alike be lost without 
these accompaniments. Towards the end of 
the month the shrubs will demand attention, 
if any are to be transplanted. Follow up the 
propagating of flower garden plants, selecting 
those things which apparently best suit the 
situation and object. Do not omit watering 
as required ; this is often a trying month for 
flowering plants : use weak liquid manure. 

Anemone seed may be sown almost as soon 
as gathered ; select a rich and light soil, and 
keep it damp until the seeds vegetate. Take 
up the old tubers and dry them, if not already 
done. 

Annuals sown out of doors now, will flower 
early in spring. Mignonette and other choice 
things can be put in pots, and preserved in 
frames through the winter. Clear away at once 
those past bloom, unless they are wanted for seed. 

Auriculas may be shifted now, but only 
take those which require it, that is, those 
whose roots are matted ; give them a soil 
composed of one half sandy, turfy loam, and one 
half decomposed cow-dung ; place the plants 
in a frame, shut it close, and shade slightly 
for a day or two, where air must be given and 
shading continued only in the middle of the 
day. Prick out and look after seedlings and 
offsets ; do not throw away the seed pan, as 
many more seeds may yet vegetate. 

Biennials of all sorts may be pricked off in 
beds prepared for them. 

Carnations. — Water the layers, and lay 
what are to be done. From those pods intended 
for seed remove all withered petals and any 
damp tendency. Seedlings may be planted 
where they are to bloom. 

Crocus seed may be sown in pans and 
placed in a cool frame, or it will do in the open 
ground. The old roots are better not lifted 
too often, if they can be allowed to remain. 

Dahlias should now be in bloom, and con- 
tinued vigilance is requisite to keep down 
vermin. Flowers for show must be shaded 
carefully, and those likely to be perfect assisted 
by taking away the buds that are near them : 



remove all bad blooms the moment they appear: 
fasten in the lateral shoots and cut away any 
spray-like branches. Bad seedlings should be 
thrown out at once. 

Laurels, Laurustinus, &c, may be re- 
moved with impunity at the end of the month ; 
a balancing of the head and root, by way of 
pruning, may be effected previous to trans- 
planting. 

Lawns should have regular and constant 
attention to mowing, rolling, sweeping, &c, 
on which their softness and closeness depends. 
JPansies. — Shade those for competition. 
Form new beds of the young plants, and still 
propagate others. Be careful to impregnate 
where seed is required, and nip off all besides. 
Increase the showy sorts for the borders. 

Perennials. — Propagate such desirable 
plants as pentstemons, phloxes, campanulas, 
double rockets, lychnis, &c, either by cuttings 
or divisions. Cut away all the flowering 
stalks that are past bloom, unless they are 
wanted for seed. 

Pinks. — Plant out in nursery rows, the 
rooted pipings, six inches apart, in a rich 
soil of sandy loam and dung. 

Ranunculus. — Sow early, either in pans, or 
in the open ground ; take up the established 
tubers, and dry and store them. 

Rhododendrons, Kalmias, and such like 
shrubs, should be copiously watered, and di- 
vested of all their seed pods ; liquid manure 
will be found beneficial, if they have not yet 
matured their growth. 

Rockets, if strong, should be planted out 
where they are to flower ; a few may be put 
in the shrubbery border. 

Roses. — Remove all the wild shoots from 
the stocks of those that are budded, and secure 
the shoots of the buds against winds : if green 
fly yet attack the young shoots, syringe with 
tobacco water promptly. 

Stocks. — The Bromptons and Twickenham 
stocks may be planted where they are to 
bloom next spring ; but it will be well to pot 
a quantity next month, and keep them in 
frames. Sow the German sorts now, and 
preserve them in frames through the winter. 

Tulips. — If the bed is in the flower garden, 
it must be filled during .summer, and so with 
ranunculuses and other bulbs, Pelargoniums 
ready to flower, being plunged in them, as 
soon as the bulbs die down ; but if apart in any 
other situation, the soil in the beds may be 
ridged, and turned at least once every month. 
Wallflowers, Stveetwilliams, and similar 
things, should be planted out if large enough, 
where they are to bloom ; or if small, pricked 
out in nursery beds : most of these look best 
in masses, and may be planted in that way 
amongst annuals and other plants, which must 
soon be cleared off. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR AUGUST. 



35; 



WINDOW GARDENING. 

The chief matter at present to be attended 
to, is to allow a regular and liberal supply of 
moisture to the plants, especially those in 
sunny aspects, using dilute manure water occa- 
sionally. Another point is to prepare hardy 
evergreens for the balconies, to replace the 
flowering plants as they go out of bloom. 
Hardy spring flowering herbaceous plants 
might also be introduced in a few of the larger 
pots or tubs ; such for instance as the Christ- 
mas rose, an&Tussilago fragrans, the first for 
its large white flowers, and the last for its 
pinkish blossoms and pleasant hawthorn-like 
scent. As they both flower by or before 
March, they are doubly welcome at a time 
when little else can be procured. 

Bulbs, such as hyacinths, crocus, &c, should 
be procured as early at the end of this month 
as possible, and potted and buried six inches 
deep in ashes under a north wall. They may 
then be had in perfection by Christmas : pot 
them in free sandy loam. 

Begonias. — Reduce the amount of water 
to such as are dying down, and let them go to 
rest. Expose the pots freely until all moisture 
is dried up, and then set them by in a dry cool 
place. 

Camellias. — Protect all the plants from too 
much moisture, and remove a few to flower 
early, to a warmer situation. 

Cinerarias. — Shift the plants as they ad- 
vance, and water freely ; stop such as appear 
likely to start into flower, in order to strengthen 
them before winter. 

Fuchsias. — Shift such as require it, or if in 
pots sufficiently large, use manure water more 
frequently than before. Put in cuttings of 
any desirable kinds, and pot them off as soon 
as they are well rooted. 

Geraniums. — Shift the early flowering 
sorts, using a free, and rather rich soil. Thin 
out the weak or misplaced shoots, and stake 
out the branches. Stop the young shoots of 
such as are to flower at the usual season, and 
shift such as require it. Keep the foliage very 
clean at all times. 

Myrtles, and other evergreens, should be 
regularly, but not too copiously supplied with 
water, and should be so placed as to have the 
full benefit of the sun to ripen their wood. 

Roses. — Keep them dry at the root by lay- 
ing the pots on their sides in a shady place. 
The Chinese, and similar sorts, should be 
pruned, and encouraged to flower again, by 
keeping them warm and damp at the root. 

Primulas. — Sow a little seed to keep up 
a succession ; shift those previously in pots, 
and keep them rather close until they root 
again. 

Violets. — Pot up a few, and place them 
48. 



in a shady situation to form new roots ; water, 
to settle the mould about the roots, but do not 
sodden them with too much. 

Warclian Cases. — Continue the treatment 
previously recommended, filling up blanks, 
and watering freely when necessary : if many 
succulents are introduced, this last operation 
must be done with great care. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

The principal operations will consist in 
preparing a stock of plants for the next 
season ; and also the different structures for 
their reception. 

Annuals. — Small sowings of the half-hardy 
sorts, as rhodanthe, schizanthus, lobelia, and 
others, may be made about the middle or end 
of the month, and may be placed in a warm 
frame until up, when they should be gradually 
hardened off, so as to stand full exposure to 
the atmosphere as long as the weather con- 
tinues favourable. The hardy species, as 
collinsia, gilia, intermediate stocks, &c, may 
also be sown, and pricked off as soon as big 
enough into pans or boxes. Give air freely 
after they are once up, in order not to weaken 
or draw the plants. 

Half-hardy plants, as calceolarias, petu- 
nias, verbenas, &c, should be propagated to 
the desired extent, and those cuttings previ- 
ously struck should be potted off. Keep 
them close until growing freely, and then 
allow plenty of ventilation : also keep them 
topped as they advance, in order to induce 
them to become shrubby ; water regularly. If 
it be intended to keep them in the cutting pots 
during the winter, the cuttings should be 
placed thinner, and they should be topped as 
soon as they are rooted, and should also be 
hardened off as soon as possible. Sow any 
seeds of these plants which have been saved, 
using a light free soil, and scattering the seeds 
very thinly. Give air freely as soon as they 
are up, and pot off singly into small pots as 
soon as they have two or three leaves. 

Forcing pit. — Many plants intended for 
forcing, may now be placed in this house, 
where they can be sheltered from the heavy 
rains, at the same time that a free supply of 
air can be admitted, and the watering so 
limited as to thoroughly mature the plants. 
Amaryllis and other bulbs, cacti, roses, and 
various others may be so treated. Lily of 
the valley, violets, and such plants, may also 
be potted up from the open ground at the end 
of the month, and should be protected from 
heavy rains. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 70 to 75 degrees by 
day, and 60 to 65 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely by ail avail-

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR AUGUST. 



able methods, and leave a considerable portion 
of the lights open all the night in very hot 
weather. 

Watering. — This should be copious where 
the plants are growing freely, and the house 
should be kept damp and syringed in the same 
proportion. Such plants as have completed 
their growth must be more sparingly supplied 
with moisture. 

Potting. — Continue to shift such plants as 
require it, being very particular in the drain- 
age, as many will have to stand all the winter 
in the pots they are put into at this season. 

Soils. — Collect new supplies as opportunity 
occurs ; old compost heaps should never be 
exhausted before more is collected ; besides, 
entirely fresh soils are not beneficial to all 
plants. 

Dressing. — See that all plants are properly 
cleaned, staked, and tied up, before they are 
staged ; also that the surface is stirred and the 
pots washed. 

Insects, &c. — Examine the balls of earth 
closely, and remove all worms or other 
vermin from the roots, previous to the plants 
being finally arranged in the house. Fumigate 
as often as green fly makes its appearance, or, 
if only a few plants are attacked, syringe with 
tobacco water. 

Aloes, and succulents generally, should be 
housed early, before heavy rains come on ; 
give only sufficient water to keep them from 
shrivelling up too much. 

Agaves, and large succulents, should also 
be placed under shelter from rain and rough 
winds. 

Alstrdmerias must be kept in a place suffi- 
ciently cool and dry to preserve the tubers 
in a plump state ; they may be examined occa- 
sionally to see that they do not get so dry as 
to shrivel. 

Annuals. — Sow some of the choice sorts 
to bloom in early spring. When potted off 
and established keep them near the light, and 
admit air freely, watering as requisite. 

Azaleas. — Remove these to a cool house, in 
case of heavy rains ; they must never get dry, 
or, if the plant be not killed, it is sure to lose 
all its leaves. 

Calceolarias. — Cut down the old plants as 
they go out of flower ; repot them, and start 
them again in a pit, kept rather close, until 
they have formed fresh roots ; shift old and 
young as they advance, and water freely : old 
plants are hardly worth growing if cuttings 
are plentiful. 

Camellias. — Begin to return such plants as 
flower early, to the house, and syringe them 
often, but keep them rather cool at present. 
Bud stocks with desirable sorts, and place the 
plants in a close warm pit, where they must 
be kept moist. 



Cape bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c., if they 
have rested two or three months, may now be 
potted in turfy loam, with a considerable 
addition of sand; place them in a cold pit, 
and give no water until they begin to grow. 

Ccphalotusfollicularis (New Holland pitcher- 
plant). — Keep a moist atmosphere about it, 
and keep it close and warm in case of cold rainy 
weather. 

Cinerarias. — Shift as the plants advance, 
and let them be supplied freely with air and 
water. Pot up more suckers or plants from 
the open ground, and keep them stopped for a 
time, so as to allow the earlier plants to gain a 
sufficient start of the next crop. 

Chrysanthemums. — Shift as requisite, and 
stop the shoots where necessary, but not later 
than about the middle of the month. Peg 
down more layers into small pots, and keep 
all sorts well watered, using manure water 
occasionally to the established plants. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, as sempervivum, 
should be very sparingly watered, especially 
such as are intended to flower soon. 

Cyclamens. — If any show signs of growth, 
they should be potted ; if not, keep them cool 
and rather dry. 

Epacris. — Protect from heavy rains such 
plants as have ripened their wood, but allow 
a free circulation of air about them at all 
times. 

Ericas. — Let these remain exposed, using 
the shade to protect them from either sun or 
rain in excess. The strong growing sorts 
should be gradually exposed to the sun as they 
ripen their wood; the smaller plants, and 
smaller growing species, are best grown in 
pits all the season, where a similar line of 
treatment can be applied to them, modified by 
their more tender habits. 

Fuchsias. — Put in cuttings of any new or 
scarce varieties, and pot off the young plants 
as soon as they are sufficiently rooted, so as to 
get them well established before the cold 
weather comes on. Shift any of the very late 
plants that require it, and use manure water 
occasionally in watering them. 

Gompholobiums, and slender creepers, should 
be protected from heavy rains, and moved early 
to an airy part of the house, if such weather 
continues. 

Haworthias, Apicras, &c, should receive 
little or no water, unless in a growing state ; 
by attention to this they may be had in all 
stages all the year through, in a warm 
house. 

Helichrysums. — Encourage such as are 
growing, applying water very carefully, and 
being sure that the drainage of the pots is 
always good. 

Leschenanltias. — Encourage the growth of 
those intended for specimens, but check such

as are wanted to start again for autumn and 
winter flowering. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan lily). — These 
Will now be flowering ; supply them still 
liberally with water, and shade them to pro- 
long the bloom ; decrease the supply of water 
as the flowers decay. 

Mignonette. — Sow a succession, and observe 
the previous directions with regard to manage- 
ment. 

New Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiasas, &c, should be guarded from heavy 
rains, but ought to remain entirely out of doors 
in other respects, in order to ripen the new 
growth. 

Orange trees. — Propagate these and their 
allies by budding and keeping the budded 
stocks in a warm, close propagating pit. The 
plants out of doors should be watered more 
sparingly as they show signs of completing 
their growth, in order to rest them previous 
to their being housed for the winter. 

Oxalis. — Dry off such as are nearly at rest, 
and keep the others dry. If any exhibit 
signs of growth, pot them and treat them as 
other Cape bulbs, but this is better deferred. 

Pelargoniums. — Cut down such as are out 
of flower, and expose them ; pot those which 
have been exposed long enough, and put them 
in a cool frame at first ; thin the buds as soon 
as they are well visible, and stop the shoots of 
the best lot as soon as they are three or four 
joints long. Those intended for autumn or 
winter flowering should not be stopped after 
the middle of the month, and may be kept 
rather closer, but not so much so as to cause 
the plants to draw up weak. 

Primulas. — Shift such as require it, and 
keep them cool : a rich light soil is most 
favourable to their growth. Sow a little seed 
to keep up a proper supply of plants : start 
the old plants if the supply is short ; they 
may be made to flower rather earlier than 
seedlings. 

Proteas, Banksias, Dryandras, fyc, must 
be removed to a very airy house as soon as 
rainy weather is apprehended, and very care- 
fully watered during its continuance. 

Rhododendrons. — These will now be ma- 
turing their wood and flower buds. This 
should be assisted by a regular but not exces- 
sive supply of moisture, especially in dry 
weather. In case of continued wet they 
should be screened from it, but by no means 
moved to a warmer situation, as that would 
inevitably set them growing again, and the 
flower buds w r ould be lost. 

Roses. — Keep these rather dry at the root, 
especially those intended to be introduced 
first : a good plan is to invert them on 
tressels so high as to keep the top clear of 
the earth, as soon as they show signs of brown 



leaves and checked growth. This practice 
should be regularly followed every month 
until the weather becomes so wet and cold as 
to make it advisable to invert the whole of 
those wanted for this house. 

Salvias. — Water these freely, using manure 
water occasionally ; and keep them in a warm 
part of the house. 

Stapelias. — Decrease the supply of water 
early, so as to forward the formation of their 
flower buds, as if these are developed early, 
the flowers expand much better than if they 
they appear late in October. 

Tropmolums. — Keep dry, and in a cool 
place, where they may remain quite at rest. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature, from 65 to 70 degrees by 
day, to 60 degrees at night. Shade during 
bright weather. 

Ventilation. — Give air in every way, so as 
to keep the heat as low as possible, but do 
not leave any on at night likely to cause 
draughts. 

Watering. — Use moisture freely to the 
coarser plants while in flower, observing 
greater caution with the more tender plants 
introduced from the other houses. The per- 
manent plants, as climbers, &c, must be regu- 
larly watered and syringed, and such as re- 
quire it should sometimes have manure water. 

Arrangement. — Continue to vary the dis- 
position of the plants as often as possible, and 
also take notes of the best plants, and the 
numbers in which required to make the best 
display at different periods. Such notes 
would afford valuable information at any time, 
and would save much trouble in preparing for 
another season. 

General Directions. — Begin to lessen the 
supply of moisture, and shade, and increase, 
if possible, the circulation of air, in order to 
keep the house cool, the flowers in perfection, 
and to ripen the wood of such plants as are 
permanent in the house, and whose growth is 
finished. Of course the necessary routine to 
ensure neatness and freedom from vermin, 
must never be remitted. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature, from 70 to 85 degrees by 
day, to 65 to 70 degrees by night. 

Ventilation must be guided by the above, 
but must never be too great, as the plants do 
not safely bear too violent alterations of the 
atmosphere. 

Watering must be performed according to 
the individual requirements of the plants. As 
a general rule the supply ought to be gra- 
dually diminished, in order to meet the loss of 
heat which a very short time will now bring 
about : syringe regularly.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR AUGUST. 



Potting. — Continue where requisite, espe- 
cially with cuttings or seedlings : these may 
be grown into nice plants before the season 
closes. 

Insects. — Use all means to keep these down, 
especially the thrip and red spider : sulphur 
and syringing are good remedies against both, 
and should be incessantly applied. 

Achimenes. — Shift those intended for late 
flowering, and still propagate for the same 
purpose, or to increase rare sorts ; a damp 
situation is suitable to their growth, a more 
sunny one to their flowering. 

Allamanda, Beaumontia, Bchites, and all 
strong growing climbers, should be encouraged 
to set with bloom by stopping such free grow- 
ing lateral and other shoots as do not appear 
likely to afford any buds by other means : re- 
duce the moisture where the plants indicate a 
cessation of activity. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, should be gradually put on a shorter 
allowance of water as they pass the flowering 
period. 

Aphelandras, Justicias, Puellias, fyc, for 
winter flowering, should be encouraged, by 
frequent shifting and a hot damp atmosphere 
to form a handsome growth ; do not stop these, 
unless the object is to make a specimen rather 
than to get flowers. 

Amaryllids. — Keep these all in a state of 
complete rest, just giving enough moisture to 
such as do not lose their leaves to keep them 
from perishing. Some shake the leafless ones 
quite out of the pots, and store them on a dry 
shelf until they show their flowers. 

Begonias. — Continue to remove them to a 
cooler place as they flower, and supply freely 
with water; they are easily propagated by 
slips or cuttings inserted in pots of sandy soil 
in heat. 

Burchellia. — Should be kept cool, and with 
a moderate supply of water. 

Cacti. — Remove all under cover if rain sets 
in, and keep them without water until they 
are quite red in the skin. Such as are wanted 
for early forcing should be still more strin- 
gently treated. 

Clerodendrons. — Remove to the conserva- 
tory as they flower, and stop and grow away 
the younger plants for winter use. 

Climbers. — Keep them stopped and regu- 
lated, and reduce the moisture to such as have 
made their growth. 

Daturas. — By having various plants under 
different methods of treatment, these plants 
may be had in flower nearly all through the 
season. Dry off some, but be sure those in a 
growing state are well supplied with water, 
and, where size is the object, with liquid ma- 
nure. 

Erythrinas. — Continue to advance such as 



are in an active state,' and cut down and 
start again such as are past flowering ; the 
young shoots are very subject to the attacks 
of insects. 

Euphorbias. — Keep the succulent ones hot 
and dry, and keep the young plants of the 
more leafy sorts, as E. jacquinijlora, continu- 
ally stopped in to get a bushy plant. 

Ferns. — Allow such as show symptoms of 
requiring rest to gradually sink into inac- 
tivity by partially withholding heat and mois- 
ture. 

Gardenias. — Grow these away in the dung 
beds or pits, supplying them copiously with 
water, and guarding against insects, although 
few attack them in such a situation. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, fyc. — Gradually with- 
hold water from such as are getting past their 
prime, and prepare them for their rest. 

B^ippeastrums, Crinums, Pancratiums, $*c, 
should be gradually rested as they complete 
their growth. Few of them, however, but 
require some water, but it should now be 
given in small quantities, or they continue 
in an active state, and produce no flowers. 

Ipomceas. — Encourage the growth of the 
late flow r ering sorts, and stop the laterals to 
make them throw more flower buds ; syringe 
constantly, to guard against red spider. 

Ixoras. — Reduce the exciting causes to 
such as have completed their growth ; shift 
growing plants. 

Jasminums, Brunfelsias, Rondeletias, S?c, 
should be rested as they arrive at maturity ; 
propagate where necessary. 

Lantanas. — Put in cuttings of the half ripe 
wood, in heat, and pot off and stop as soon as 
rooted : keep them stopped as they advance, 
and they will form good plants in the spring, 
either for the houses or bedding out. 

Lucidia gratissima. — Continue the treat- 
ment given last month, varying it to meet the 
season. 

Malvaceous Plants, as hibiscus, will be in 
flower ; water freely, and syringe often, occa- 
sionally with tobacco water for the green 
fly. 

Manettias, and other tender climbers, will 
some of them be in bloom ; water freely, and 
keep them neatly arranged. 

31elastomas. — Such as have not flowered 
should be grown freely, and kept near the 
glass. 

3Ielo-cacti may begin to rest if they have 
made a good growth, but it is easy to have 
them in an active state by keeping them moist, 
near the glass, and in a moist heat. 

Musas. — Water freely, occasionally with 
liquid manure, and syringe often, but be 
particular at all times not to wet the flowers. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher-plant). — Continue a 
moist atmosphere and high temperature, 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



357 



guarding against stagnant water near the 
roots. 

Neriums like to be cool at the root, with 
the head freely exposed to the light. They 
may be easily induced to flower for a length 
of time, by giving them a rich soil, and much 
water and heat. 

Nymjrfueas ("Water lilies). — Keep the water 
clean and sweet about them ; the water rather 
above than under the temperature of the house. 

Palms. — Syringe well, and water copiously 
at the root ; sometimes with liquid manure. 

Thunbergias. — Prune freely to produce 
laterals, and syringe often ; they are all very 
liable to the attacks of red spider. Propagate 
those which do not seed freely, by cuttings in 
sand in bottom heat. 

Vincas will be flowering freely; a succession 
should be kept up by cutting back some of the 
old plants, and allowing them to break again. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm house for the 
Indian species, 85 to 90 degrees by day, to 
75 degrees by night ; the cool, or Mexican 
house, 75 to 80 degrees by day, to 65 degrees 
by night. 

Ventilation. — Air should be admitted pretty 
freely among such plants as are resting in the 
Mexican house. Greater caution must be 
observed in the Indian house, as many of the 
plants are still growing. 

Watering. — Be careful in watering plants at 
rest, those in a growing state may be liberally 
supplied, and the syringe should be always 
in use. The water should always be a few 
degrees hotter than the house to allow for the 
loss of heat in the course of its fine dispersion 
by the syringe. 

Insects. — Be continually on the alert. A 
new enemy may now be expected in force — 
the earwig. 

Potting. — Continue, wherever necessary, 



changing such as do not appear to thrive on 
blocks to baskets or pots, and so on with the 
rest, as may appear most proper. There is 
much to be learnt in this way. 

Shading must be continued over the grow- 
ing plants, but may be partially dispensed 
with over such as are at rest, using it only 
during the hottest portions of the day. 

Soils. — Continue to collect all likely mate- 
rials; especially singular or appropriate knobs 
and slabs of wood, for these seem better 
adapted for many plants, and not so offensive 
to the eye as the baskets in common use. 

Imported Plants should be gradually 
brought forward as before directed. The 
masses of pseudo bulbs should not be disturbed 
too much at first, unless very much decayed ; 
any dust or mould from them should be 
strewed over the plant again as more likely to 
suit it than fresh soil. 

Aerides, Saccolabiwns, and Vandas, should 
be rested as they complete their growth, but 
should be kept in the warm house. 

Cymbidiums should be kept cool and rather 
dry after their growth, until wanted to flower, 
when they generally start without difficulty. 

Cattleyas. — Grow away, taking great care 
the young roots are not destroyed by the 
various insects which feed on them. 

Dendrobiums. — Eemove such as D. nobile 
and its allies to the cool house, and keep them 
rather dry for some time. Those producing 
spikes of flowers, should be continued in the 
warm house, with only a small allowance of 
warm water while at rest. 

Oncidiums. — Continue to remove these to 
the cool house as they form their growths, and 
restrict the supply of water. 

Stanhopeas. — Such as have only lately 
flowered should be encouraged to strong 
growth while the heat and light is powerful ; 
afterwards they should rest until they show 
their flowers. 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



The great secret of getting rich is to make 
the most of what we have, and whether this 
applies to money, to time, or to land, it is the 
same. You may almost tell what a man is by 
the appearance of his garden. Does he make 
the most of his ground ? then there is some 
hope he is prudent. Does he make the most 
of his labour ? he will rarely want. We do 
not mean that such men are never unfortunate, 
that they have not their troubles and trials 
like other men; but under every kind of 
visitation such men are better prepared, and 
therefore suffer less than careless reckless 
persons. In a garden no rod of ground should 
be ever idle. If a man who is naturally lazy has 
not kept his ground well cropped, he may have 



his excuses about laying fallow, ridging it in 
winter to mellow the soil, or leaving it rough 
that the frost may get into it ; but there is no 
occasion for all this, — the soil need on no 
occasion to be at rest ; change of work is 
a holiday to man, and change of crop is all 
that any ground needs ; for no two crops 
require the same kind of feeding, and conse- 
quently, by changing from one which requires 
high feeding of one kind to another that re- 
quires no feeding, or feeding of another sort, 
the ground continues at work without being 
exhausted. If ground has been used for car- 
rots, parsnips, or beet-root, it may be imme- 
diately cropped with lettuces, or some crop 
which has no tap roots. Turnips, also, and

potatoes, may be followed by peas. Very little 
attention (if that be properly devoted) will be 
necessary to prevent ground being wasted, or 
crops being out of place. When a garden is 
wanted for a family, and economy rather than 
variety is to be consulted, we are quite sure 
that asparagus, sea-kale, and similar expensive 
things, ought not to be undertaken. The first 
object is plenty, the second object is the choice 
of those subjects which last on the ground, or 
preserve well when taken off! Potatoes are a 
first consideration, onions, carrots, parsnips, 
and beet-root, are next, and Jerusalem arti- 
chokes are not to be forgotten, because all 
these are capable of being stored for months 
after they are taken up ; then, of those which 
last a long time on the ground, and afford a con- 
stant supply, scarlet beans, cabbages, onions, 
winter spinach, and savoys, are the most 
worthy of a cottager's attention ; and brocoli 
(except the sprouting, which is a hardy useful 
vegetable), cauliflowers, peas, and other sub- 
jects, which yield less produce on the same 
ground, by reason of the greater quantity of 
room they take, or the longer period of remain- 
ing on the ground, must be considered as 
luxuries. Every body with a garden must 
consider the circumstances under which he has 
to cultivate it. If he has more ground than 
his family require for their supply, care must 
be taken to have the surplus of a useful and 
marketable nature, such as are always saleable, 
and if not bought on the ground, capable of 
being preserved for some time. All the 
articles mentioned in the first instance are of 
this nature. Potatoes, carrots, parsnips, beet- 
root, onions, and such like subjects, when 
ripened, will keep, and are always in request, 
whereas to over-grow any perishable crop is 
unwise, because they will bring nothing, as 



when one person is overdone, most people are 
in the same predicament. There are some 
seasons in which it is better to sow for main 
crops, but in a general way it is better 
to have different sowings, and not too large, 
because all will frequently come in to- 
gether, and so in a few days all be gone by. 
How frequently do we see a whole planting 
of cauliflowers come in and go by in a single 
week ; they are unlike cabbages in this 
respect, for a cabbage is eatable from the time 
it has four good leaves until it is hard and 
solid ; hence cabbage is the most useful of 
the green crops, and should be sown at all 
seasons, that there may be always some ready 
to plant out. Savoys are perhaps the most 
hardy of the good winter greens. Scotch kale 
may be an exception, for hardly any degree 
of frost will kill it. Brussels sprouts are an 
excell nt green ; but when the object is 
economy of ground, it is better to limit the 
crops to those which are most servicable as 
food, or most saleable as a surplus. As a 
general rule, where ground is an object, double 
culture is desirable, that is, the planting of 
one crop between the rows of another crop; 
sowing rows of spinach or peas, or planting 
rows of French beans, or lettuces or leeks, 
beet-root or parsnips, between rows of other 
subjects. The only good object to be attained 
by this is the saving, perhaps, of a month or 
something more occasionally by digging be- 
tween the rows of a crop that may be not 
cleared off for a month or six weeks, and 
planting young stuff that will not be in its 
way till that time arrives, although it will be 
getting on pretty nearly as fast as if there was 
nothing there. When the other crop comes 
off, the digging of the ground on which they 
stood will let air into the soil, and greatly 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING, 



359 



refresh the rising crop, whatever it may be. 
Another mode of economising the ground is 
to plant out some subjects at half distances. 
Cabbages, in the fall of the year, are adapted 
for this. If, for instance, they would cabbage 
well at two feet apart from row to row, 
and eighteen inches from plant to plant, put 
them in rows only one foot apart, and only 
nine inches from each other in the row: all 
through the winter, you may be pulling the 
alternate rows for greens and cabbage plants, 
and when you have removed the alternate 
rows you may begin to pull up the alternate 
plants ; meanwhile the plants intended to cab- 
bage have lost nothing, because before they are 
too thick those that are removed give ample 
room to the remainder to cabbage. Another 
mode of economising, is to sow radishes, 
spring onions, lettuces, &c, in the same 
quarters as the early potatoes, and they are 
cleared off for consumption or for planting 
out before the potatoes are inconvenienced, or 
grow enough to injure the other crops. Ex- 
perience will always teach us the best mode 
of economising ground and labour ; but some 
few general hints may be useful to the amateur 
and the cottager. There are many books in 
which there are directions for the garden 
operations every month in the year, but even 
the best of them are not explicit enough in 
respect to the quantities or proportions of 
ground to be sown or planted ; but so much 
depends on the circumstances under which a 
garden is cultivated, the wants of the culti- 
vator, and his command of labour, that we 
hardly know how it could be defined, unless 
we take an ordinary garden required for an 
ordinary supply. There are not, however, 
two families alike in this particular : one 
family may not consume a peck of onions in 
a year, while another, no larger, may eat 
several bushels; under these circumstances 
(like the little work called Gardening for the 
Million), we recommend frequent sow r ing 
rather than large crops, and lay it down as a 
rule that the wants must regulate the supply. 
Productive gardening, therefore, may mean 
large produce, abundance of everything ; but 
the intended application of the term is large 
produce without waste, and the way to secure 
this is to limit the quantity of perishable 
articles, and make ail the abundance and 
surplus of some crop which is always sale- 
able and not perishable, — that is, not perish- 
able within the period of several weeks. We 
propose to direct briefly the cultivation of the 
various subjects desirable to a family, so as to 
make the most of the ground. 

POTATOES. 

The numerous writers on the cultivation of 
the potato differ as much in their plans as if 



they were advising upon as many different 
subjects. We have grown them upon every 
plan. The indifference of the root to many 
different modes of treatment, and its success 
occasionally under all, has made all men too 
careless. We set out with preferring whole 
tubers for sets, in preference to cut sets, when 
they can be got of the right size, and, when 
we can get whole sets, we like autumn planting 
better than spring. Whole sets should, on 
account of economy, be small, that is, about 
the size of a walnut in its green husk ; those 
much smaller might prove weak, if much 
larger there would be waste. Whole tubers 
are less liable than cut ones to be damaged by 
wet or frost, but for winter planting, or rather 
for autumn planting, they should be a clear 
six inches under the surface, for which pur- 
pose the dibble must be thrust down eight 
inches. In selecting the place for potatoes, 
plant those intended to be early under a south 
wall or paling, or on a sloping southern aspect, 
using the Ash-leaf kidney, Soden's early 
Oxford, Pilot's flour-ball, Alliway's early 
seedling, and Looker's Oxonian, or any other of 
the well-known early kinds. Plant any of 
these a foot apart, in rows eighteen inches from 
each other. Plant in October. Between 
these rows there may be planted rows of cab- 
bage plants, not more than six inches apart, 
to be pulled as greens as soon as they are large 
enough to eat, beginning by taking every other 
one the first time you go over them, and 
clearing them altogether the second time. 
When the potato plants are well up, let them 
be earthed, that is, the earth drawn up round 
their stems with a hoe; but although we men- 
tion October, the open weather from that time 
till May would be good, if the vegetation 
could be kept back ; for the instant a potato 
begins to shoot the eyes, it begins to take 
harm. Common sense dictates that the instant 
the eyes begin to swell the tuber ought to be 
in the ground ; for this reason, seed potatoes 
ought never to be pitted, but when taken up 
they should be dried on the surface of the 
ground, or what is called greened. This 
process thickens the skin, evaporates a portion 
of the moisture, and adapts them for keeping, 
though it totally spoils them for eating. They 
ought then to be kept in a dry, cool place 
until the period for planting arrives. Suppose 
them disinclined to gi'ow, and the eyes not to 
start even till late in the spring, they would 
be just as well planted the last day as the 
first; but we repeat that the instant they 
begin to grow (before planting), they begin to 
lose quality. Presuming large potatoes alone 
can be had for seed, the necessity of cutting 
them into smaller sets must be admitted ; but 
equal care, indeed greater rather than less care, 
must be taken to cut and plant before they 



JGO 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



begin to grow. In a general way it may be 
observed that a potato has the eyes for growing 
chiefly on one half. Now if fhejpotatoes to 
be cut are in good order, and not growing, 
one-half may be cut off for eating, the other 
containing the eyes should be so cut as to 
have one strong eye on each shoot ; some are 
more liberal, and have two, and in some kinds 
of potatoes the eyes sit so close that you are 
obliged to have more. These cuts should be 
spread out to dry before they are planted ; 
a little lime sifted over them, so as to dust 
them all, is desirable. The planting may be 
entirely regulated by the disposition to 
grow. It may be sufficient to say here that 
when a potato is in the ground it is gaining 
strength as it grows, but while it is out of the 
ground it is losing. It may also be observed 
that potato planting is good so long as potato 
sets that have not begun to grow can be pro- 
cured. The various modes of planting depends 
on the quantity of ground, the rate of labour, 
and the quality of the soil. The following 
practices are common in different localities : 

1. Trenches one spit deep are dug, and the 
soil thrown on one side; the trenches are half 
filled with stable dung, the sets placed on the 
dung, and the soil placed on the top, forming 
a complete ridge, under which the potatoes 
soon vegetate and often yield heavy crops ; 
but in general the best potatoes for eating are 
those grown on undunged land, which does 
not yield so much. 

2. Dung is placed on the land and dug in, 
and the sets are dibbled in from four to six 
inches below the surface ; in this case the soil 
should always be pressed on the tuber, that it 
may lie solid on the ground, for if this be 
carelessly attempted, one half the sets, being 
dropped into a hole that a lump of soil may 
stop up half way, would be left without any 
soil surrounding them: this cannot but be inju- 
rious, therefore we cannot be too particular in 
seeing that the soil above is bruised and lightly 
pressed, so as to surround the set. 

3. Where there is much land, furrows are 
ploughed, the potatoes dropped into them, and 
ploughing the next furrow covers them up. 
In this case, the second furrow is not used, as 
it would be too near for the rows, but the 
third furrow fills the second, and is used for 
the sets, the fourth covers them in, and so on, 
the whole ground being thus well stirred. If 
such land is to be dunged, the dressing is 
spread over the surface and ploughed in. 

4. After digging and, if necessary, dress- 
ing the ground, the sets are laid in rows of 
the proper distance, and earth is taken from 
between the rows and thrown on the sets. 

A crop of very early potatoes may be had, 
by digging the ground along the foot of a 
Bouth wall, placing the .sets a foot apart, and 



about six inches from it, and then take earth 
from the front and throw on them so as to 
form a sloping bank, and when the plants 
come up, earth them up on the outside. This 
may be a small crop, because it is generally 
dry, but it comes early in proportion, and 
always of fine flavour. The late potatoes 
ought not to be planted late, that is, the sets 
must not have grown out before planting, and 
the distance for the late ones ought to be two 
feet, and the very large ones two feet six 
from row to row. Potatoes are ripe when 
the haulm decays. Regent's, Forty-fold, York 
red, Ne plus ultra kidney, Champion, Red 
kidney, are good sorts for main crops. 

CARROTS, PARSNIPS, AND BEET-ROOT. 

Next to potatoes, which are food for months, 
these three vegetables are the most useful. 
They are not only good with almost every 
kind of meat, but they are always saleable in 
any quantity ; all grounds are not suitable, 
for they recpiire fifteen inches of good rich 
light soil, free from gravel and stones. The 
soil should be trenched and well broken ; beds 
of four feet wide, with one foot alleys between 
them, are the most handy for all three, and 
the seed should be very thinly sown over them ; 
when the plants are up, they should be hoed 
to leave them eight or nine inches apart, nor 
should a single weed be allowed to grow. 
The first hoeing may not do this effectually, 
but the second, with the help of the hand oc- 
casionally, will accomplish it. These crops 
are valuable in all families, and, besides using 
them as soon as they are large enough, they 
may be stored as soon as they are ripe, and, 
with care, keep through the winter. The 
early carrots to be drawn and eaten as soon as 
they are of sufficient size, should be sown in 
February and March, the main crop the latter 
end of April ; the best for the former is the 
Early horn and its varieties ; the best for the 
late is the Altringham. For storing they 
ought not to be taken up until the foliage 
turns yellow. 

ONIONS. 

This is one of the most useful of vegeta- 
bles, and deserves especial attention ; like the 
previously mentioned crops, they keep a long 
while if well ripened, and the principal art in 
their culture is to well dress the ground : well 
decomposed night soil a good two inch thick- 
ness all over the soil, forked into and well 
mixed with the top six inches of mould, will 
be found an excellent dressing ; but it must be 
well decomposed, or it will be too strong. 
The surface should be well levelled, the lumps 
well bruised, and the seeds sown thinly and 
equally over the bed ; this should be rolled in 
or trodden in solid, and raked smooth and

eveu. The beds, like those of all crops sown 
broad-cast, ought to be four feet wide, with alleys 
of one foot. The month for sowing for a main 
crop is March, quite the beginning ; when 
they are up they should be hoed out, so as to 
leave them six inches apart, and in a week or 
two a second hoeing will be found necessary ; 
as the onions grow there may be found some 
close to each other — two in a place instead of 
one. These should be drawn by hand, so as 
to leave only one, and they must be kept clear 
of weeds all through their growth. When 
the period for taking up approaches, and the 
bulbs have swelled nearly as much as they 
will, the market gardeners make a practice of 
breaking down the foliage, under an impres- 
sion that to keep on growing would exhaust 
the onion, and that stopping the growth of 
the leaves by breaking the necks throws all 
the strength into the bulb : we venture to 
affirm that this is a mistake, the breaking 
down of the leaves can be of no service ; they, 
like all other plants, receive one kind of 
nourishment from their foliage, another from 
the root, and unless all goes on harmoniously, 
things cannot be at their best. However, 
when the foliage begins to turn yellow the 
bulbs are ripe, and may be lifted and left on 
the surface of the ground to dry out some of 
their moisture ; they should be preserved in a 
cool dry airy place. The sowing of earlier 
crops and later ones for present use may 
always be done where something else is grow- 
ing, such as between lettuces that are planted 
out, or any warm border or corner, or in 
frames ; they do not come under our defini- 
tion of productive garden, but rather among 
the luxuries than otherwise. The sorts best 
adapted are the Deptford, white Spanish, 
Tripoli, and Portugal ; all these keep well 
and grow to a useful size. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 

The value of this root was, perhaps, hardly 
known by a large portion of the public until 
the scarcity of the potato rendered all vegeta- 
bles available ; as a substitute it is very poor, 
but as a vegetable capable of being dressed 
many ways, and requiring very different 
treatment in cooking from the potato, it is 
worth a place, because it is preserved as easily 
as any vegetable in store all the winter, and 
can be made available. It is chiefly used in 
stews, alone or with other vegetables. The 
culture is very easy ; the haulm grows six 
feet high, therefore requires room and support. 
The best place is along the back of a border, 
or next to north or east palings and hedges. 
One row is found prolific, but as the uncouth- 
ness of this crop is against it, most people 
who cultivate it only have a large patch in 



the worst part of the garden, so that neither 
sun nor air can get to the roots. They are 
mostly left for years, the tubers becoming 
numerous and small. If there is to be a 
second row, there ought not to be less than a 
yard between the rows ; plant them like po- 
tatoes, and dig up the crop annually, and keep 
it clean ; take out every tuber, and, at the 
proper time, plant them again. 

TURNIPS. 

This is one of those useful vegetables that 
can be enjoyed with almost everything. In 
field culture it is precarious, but in garden 
quantities it is very manageable. They may 
be sown every month from February to Sep- 
tember, and for families using quantities it is 
better to sow every month. They should be 
sown broad-cast in four feet wide beds, and as 
they get four rough leaves they should be 
hoed out six inches apart, and be cleared of 
weeds. They may require several hoeings, 
and a succession of crops for those who con- 
sume many will be desirable, but regard 
should be had to the probable supply of other 
vegetables when these are likely to come in 
for eating, and this, with the quantity likely 
to be wanted, must always guide these com- 
paratively perishable crops ; for turnips are not 
so well stored as carrots, parsnips, or beet- 
root ; but no vegetable can be more whole- 
some than the turnip, and so that they be not 
oversown they are really good. The new 
early stone, the Dutch, and the Maltese yel- 
low, are the best for culinary purposes. The 
best month for sowing a principal crop is 
June, but if showery weather come in July, 
that is a good month. 

CABBAGES. 

Of all the green crops this is the most valu- 
able ; it may be sown and planted out, if the 
weather be open, every month in the year ; it 
stands almost any frost. It is eatable from the 
time it is large enough to handle until it has ac- 
quired a hard close heart. It is a crop to put on 
every bit of otherwise idle ground ; it can be 
planted between rows of anything and every- 
thing, either to be eaten as greens when large 
enough, or left to cabbage on the coming off 
of other crops. They should be sown thickish on 
a seed-bed in January, and every week there 
should be a lot put out, three inches apart, to 
strengthen for planting out. The sowings 
should be repeated every month till August, for 
a constant succession of plants is everything. 
There need not, however, be large quantites 
sown each time ; the quantity must be regu- 
lated by the wants. Nor is the use of this 
excellent vegetable over when the full grown 
cabbage is cut, for the sprouts which follow 
are equally good. Planted out to cabbage, 



362 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



they should be eighteen inches apart in the 
rows, and the rows two feet asunder. When 
the best part of the cabbage is cut, other crops 
may be planted between the rows, the ground 
being first dug, and the stumps may be all 
taken up and be planted close together in 
some otherwise useless spot and yield a mass 
of greens when scarcely anything else is to be 
had. The seed is but little object ; sowing, 
therefore, to provide at all times plants to put 
out is a necessary precaution. The best sorts 
are new Early nonsuch, Wheeler's imperial, 
Sprotsborough, Nonpareil, and Early York — 
the Battersea is not to be despised, though it 
grows a large size and wants plenty of room. 

SCOTCH KALE, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, SAVOYS. 

These are only so many different mem- 
bers of the same family, and may or may not 
be used. The savoy is the most useful, the 
Scotch kale the most hardy, but it is an infe- 
rior green to either a good savoy or cabbage. 
The savoy should be sown in April for a gene- 
ral crop, and the Brussels sprout and kale at 
the same time. These may, when large 
enough, be planted, or rather pricked out, 
three inches apart, to strengthen previous to 
planting out in their final place. In doing 
this the strongest plants must be taken, and 
every few days, as others get large enough, 
they may be pricked out, so that the store- 
beds may have a succession of plants con- 
stantly coming in, large enough to plant out 
as they are wanted. They may be always 
planted out as other crops are cleared, when 
the ground is not required for a different pur- 
pose. 

RED CABBAGE. 

Few people know the worth of this, ex- 
cept for its use as a pickle, but a moment's 
consideration will convince any thinking per- 
son that the immense number brought to 
market can never be consumed for that alone. 
It is used raw as a salad, and is excellent. 
When grown well, too, and cut at the right 
time, the red cabbage will store the best part 
of the winter, merely losing two or three 
of the outer leaves. As a salad it is econo- 
mical and capable of being eaten by itself, 
and only requires to be cut into the thinnest 
possible shreds. The seed of the red cabbage 
may be sown in August, so as to get strong 
enough to stand the winter in the store-beds, 
where they are to be pricked out six inches 
apart. They may be planted out in Febru- 
ary or March to their final destination, two 
feet apart one way and eighteen inches the 
other ; spinach may be sown in drills between 
the rows, and will come off before the cab- 
bages get large enough to occupy the room 
themselves. Seed may also be sown in small 



quantities in January in a frame or among 
the radishes, to be protected with litter from 
frost, and they will succeed from sowings any 
time during the period from January to 
August. When they have established them- 
selves after final planting out and begun to 
grow, the earth should be drawn up to their 
stems, and they may remain in the ground until 
they are hard and solid, for in that state they 
will keep for months. 

SCARLET BEAN. 

This is the poor man's luxury, for besides 
growing up against palings, or in almost any 
corner of the garden, or as a blind, and the 
plant from its peculiarity forming a good 
fence or hedge to separate any two depart- 
ments of the garden, it is very prolific, and 
can hardly be said to leave off growing and 
bearing until the frost cuts it off. Again, 
the beans are allowed to grow to a size that 
renders the yield considerable, and the larger 
they are, the better they eat, until they get 
old and stringy. The seed should be sown in 
April, and the following are the different 
modes of planting them : — three in a patch, at 
a distance of three feet from patch to patch, or 
singly in rows a foot apart. In the first, poles 
or strong branches are driven into the ground 
at each patch; in the other they may be trained 
up bean sticks, placed along the row, or poles 
may be placed eight or ten feet apart and a 
line fastened along the tops, from which single 
lines may be led to each individual bean, or if 
against a north wall or paling, nails may be 
driven along the top, from which strings may 
be fastened in lengths to each plant. When 
they begin to bear, they should be frequently 
looked over, and all that are large enough, 
be picked for use, because they grow rapidly, 
and so long as they will break short in two 
pieces without being stringy, they are eatable. 
If a succession is desirable, sow again in May, 
June, and July. Another, and if the ground 
be limited, a more advantageous way of grow- 
ing them, is to sow the seed in a patch, in two 
or three barrows of dung for the sake of slight 
bottom heat, putting about six inches of 
mould for them to grow in, and when, about 
the middle of May, the weather looks settled, 
plant them out carefully without losing any of 
the fibres, and place the sticks, or poles, or 
string to them as soon as they are out. 

HARICOT BEAN. 

As a winter store, a few rows of the large 
white kidney or haricot bean may be sown at 
the end of April, and allowed to go to seed alto- 
gether, the entire crop to be used for stewing 
in winter. They require rich ground, that is 
to say, soil which has some heart in it, but 
after earthing up they require little or no 
care till they are fit to gather in. 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



363 



BROAD BEAN. 

A few rows of these may be grown with 
advantage ; let the beans be planted about six 
or eight inches apart in an open situation. 
When they are well up, the earth must be 
drawn to their stems, and as soon as they are 
in bloom, their tops must be taken off. They 
require to be gathered at two or three different 
gatherings, because the lower ones will fill 
out before the others, and when large enough 
to pick, their removal will strengthen the 
others. The seasons for sowing are from 
November to March, but as the economy of 
the ground on the one hand, and the chances 
of injury by frost on the other, render spring 
planting best for the cottager, it is better to 
insert them in the ground about March ; there 
is less risk of disappointment. There are 
many sorts or varieties of these beans ; Marshall's 
prolific is a sweet eating and heavy bearing 
variety, but not large ; other good ones are 
Wonderful Longpod, improved thick Wind- 
sor, green Windsor, and Toker. 

CELERY. 

Although not always the most economical 
way of disposing of ground, if celery be 
grown in the ordinary way, a piece should 
always be spared for a supply for soups ; celery 
for this purpose may be sown in a warm 
border in February, and as soon as it is large 
enough to prick out, it should be put 
two or three inches apart, only in a bit of 
good rich soil, to grow into strength. When 
it has advanced so as to stand the removal well, 
it may be planted in the common surface in 
rows three feet apart, so that any crop that 
comes off pretty early may be planted between. 
As the celery advances in growth, draw the 
earth up the stems, and continue this as long 
as it is in the ground. It will be found quite 
as useful in soup as if it had been grown in 
the trenches, and with not a tenth part of the 
trouble, and in time it will be large enough to 
eat as salad ; the only thing it requires is 
constantly earthing up as it advances ; there 
will be a sufficient quantity blanched to make 
it eatable, but a few plants for soups are as 
necessary as onions, and as wholesome. 

LEEK. 

Perhaps, looking at the utility of this escu- 
lent, boiled, stewed, or in soup, there are few 
more useful vegetables, and it has the advan- 
tage of taking but little room; it may be planted 
anywhere ; it can be used in an alternate row 
with almost any thing, and not require more 
than a six inch extra allowance between the 
rows ; or if they are planted in rows two feet 
apart, any crop you please may be planted 
between them, especially any kind of winter 
green. Sow the seed in a patch in February, 



when it comes up keep it very clear of weeds; 
as soon as large enough, prick out six inches 
apart in a piece of well dressed ground, and 
when it has acquired good strength, plant nine 
inches apart in the row and the rows two feet 
asunder for a crop between, or one foot 
asunder if no other crop is to be introduced, 
but lettuces may be planted in the alternate 
rows, and the alternation of crops looks well 
if nicely managed. It is as well to earth up 
leeks as you would celery, that is, sufficient 
to blanch about three inches or so of the plant. 
Boiled in salt and water till they are tender, 
and eaten with melted butter like asparagus or 
sea-kale, the water being changed when half 
done, the leek is excellent, and when used in 
soup they should be boiled, cut into two inch 
lengths, and used in plenty by stewing them 
afterwards with the soup itself. The leek is 
not sufficiently cultivated among cottagers; and 
some object to them on account of their very 
strong flavour, while boiling them and throwing 
the first water away just before they are quite 
done, renders them as mild as a Spanish onion; 
whereas there are many advantages in their 
culture that should induce them to be adopted 
to a great extent, if not preferred for the pur- 
poses to which onions are generally devoted. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Here we are getting to something rather 
extravagant, but there is nothing but economy 
to prevent its culture, and our business is to 
show how easily it can be done if wanted. 
Trench a row of soil eighteen inches wide 
across or along any quarter of the garden 
that is open, put a good four inches thickness 
of dung between the lower and upper spits of 
earth and tread it in, then throw in the top 
spit, which should be of itself in good heart. 
In the centre of this trenched ground draw a 
line tight, and within a circle of six inches 
place half a dozen seeds every eighteen inches 
along the row ; four feet from this, do an- 
other, and so occupy as much ground as you 
like with rows at these distances. The ob- 
ject of placing them at such a distance is to 
have crops between. This sowing to take 
place in February, March or April. When 
the seed vegetates, the place may be kept 
clear of weeds, and when it can be seen which 
of the plants take the lead, leave the strongest, 
two in a place, and keep them very clear 
from weeds. In the mean time the ground 
between these rows may be cropped with any- 
thing that may be required, so that there be 
room left for the young plants of asparagus 
to gi*ow. When the haulm turns yellow it 
may be cut down, and in cropping the inter- 
mediate ground, care must be taken to avoid 
injuring the roots, which will be found near 
the surface ; a little soil may be hoed towards 



36-1 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



the stems, so as to have the effect of covering 
up the roots a little, as a sort of protection, 
and forming a slight ridge, that it may be seen 
where the rows are. The principal object is 
to keep clear of weeds. Cut down the haulm 
at the end of the growth, and slightly earth 
up, to keep the row conspicuous when there 
are no plants to show it, and avoid damaging 
it in minding the other crops. After the 
third year you may calculate on cutting, and 
the only way to do this with advantage, for 
your own eating, is to let the buds grow a 
good four inches above the surface, and then 
cut it even with the ground. All the trouble 
of forming beds, and earthing up eight or 
nine inches, is saved by doing without the 
long useless stem which market bundles 
have, and instead of being a troublesome 
thing, involving considerable labour, to form 
the beds every autumn, there is no more 
trouble than there would be with a cabbage 
crop. For family purposes the asparagus is 
better, the roots are less exhausted, the ground 
less interrupted or interfered with, and, in fact, 
the luxury is no more trouble than a crop of 
broad beans, or a row of scarlet runners. In 
cutting this vegetable, care must be taken to 
avoid injuring the root. On cutting down the 
stems after the first year's cutting for use, a 
good dressing of dung should be laid at top, 
and a little soil thrown on it : the immediate 
effect of this is beneficial, and it scarcely more 
than reinstates the soil, for it washes away 
from the roots, and in time would expose 
them altogether ; but there is to be no pro- 
fessed earthing up to lengthen the buds as if 
they were for market, for that does away 
with the simplicity and economy of this mode 
of treating it, which is reducing its culture 
to the same trouble as almost any other 
vegetable, and the quantity eatable is nearly 
treble that which can be found in the mar- 
keted asparagus. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

This highly esteemed vegetable is economi- 
cally or extravagantly grown according as it is 
required in or out of season. If sown in March, 
pricked out when large enough into a well- 
dressed bed to gain strength, and planted out in 
its final place in June, there is no more trouble 
required to grow cauliflowers than cabbages. 
It is only when sowing in frames and pro- 
tecting under hand-glasses are resorted to, for 
the purpose of producing early maturity, that 
the thing becomes extravagant, because of the 
labour necessarily expended on it. Many 
vegetables are of the same nature ; if we were 
content to have them in their natural season, 
they would cost us but little ; but to obtain 
them out of season much labour and expense 
s frequently incurred. Sow, therefore, on a 



warm border in March. In April they will 
be large enough to prick out, three or four 
inches, or say six inches, apart ; these will 
have attained such strength in June as to 
be planted out in their final destination in 
the garden, and come in well for use in the fall 
of the season. If you sow on a slight hot-bed 
in January, and when large enough prick them 
out in a frame, but without much heat, and 
bring them well forward by April and May 
to plant out, you may get them much earlier. 
If you desire to have plants to grow through 
the winter, sow in August, prick out where 
they can be covered with a garden-light, and 
stand protected all winter ; but the strongest 
may be planted out under hand-glasses, three 
or four under each glass. In this case, great 
care has to be taken about keeping the glasses 
down in cold weather, and during heavy falls, 
and taking them off altogether, or tilting them, 
in any mild weather. As they grow large 
enough to crowd each other under the glasses, 
take away the weakest, and plant them out in 
the open ground, leaving only one, or per- 
haps two plants, to complete their growth, 
under each hand-glass ; as they show their 
flower the leaves should be bent down, to 
keep the sun off, that the colour may not be 
injured. Cauliflowers should be planted out 
as a general crop two feet apart one way, and 
eighteen inches the other ; but under hand- 
glasses there must be room for the hand- 
glasses to be taken off and placed in the row 
when the plants are at their largest size. The 
best sorts are Walcheren, Asiatic, and Early. 

BKOCOLI. 

Here is a varied and an excellent crop, 
and occasionally a cheap one. It is, however, 
one which no poor man ought to trust. Of 
the varieties choose Grange's early white, 
Chappel's cream, Somers's superb, Chappel's 
white Roman, Purple cape, White cape, and 
Early sprouting. The latter is the most use- 
ful. From January to June this vegetable 
might be sown every month, pricked out six 
inches apart as soon as it is large enough, and 
planted when strong enough. In this way 
brocoli is obtained from various sowings and 
plantings all the latter part of the summer and 
through the autumn and winter, unless it be 
very untoward weather. The sprouting sort 
is a very delicious and economical vegetable ; 
it eats well with anything, gives a good sup- 
ply for a long period, and requires but little 
labour. The best season for sowirg all the 
sorts is February and March, half each 
month. As soon as they have four rough 
leaves, prick them out in an open space, six 
inches apart, taking the strongest plants from 
the seed-bed each time ; you will thus get 
several different seasons out of each sowing. 



PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



\(S& 



As soon as they have attained the necessary- 
strength, begin to plant some out, either be- 
tween crops of other things that are coming 
off, or in quarters devoted to them ; but Ave 
are always anxious, as a row of anything is 
off that will admit of being replaced, to get 
something on the ground. Brocoli thus put 
out in a moderate garden, as room is made by 
other things coming off, must come in well 
at some time or other, and if one season misses 
all cannot. As soon as the plants which are 
put out for good, begin to grow, the earth 
ought to be drawn to the roots, and after this, 
little or no care is necessary. 

ENDIVE. 

This is a hardy salad, and may be culti- 
vated in small quantities with advantage, 
sown in April, May, and June, and planted 
out when large enough on a bank sloping to 
the south : it is a fine wholesome salad with 
beet-root and lettuce, or with red cabbage. 
When the plants are large enough these must 
be blanched by tying them up like lettuces, 
or by laying tiles or slates, or flat pieces of 
board, on them : one foot apart all over the bed 
would do for distance at planting out, and it 
is very little trouble. 

SEA KALE. 

Another luxury ; little or no trouble when 
cultivated for its proper season, and only costly 
when forced. For instance, many acres are 
grown that are merely put out in rows and 
earthed up. When the sprouts come forward 
they break the earth on the surface, the culti- 
vator then removes the earth low enough to 
enable him to cut off the shoots down clean 
to the crown of the plants. Here, as neither 
fire-heat nor dung is used, it cannot be said 
to cost much. The proper mode of cultiva- 
tion is to sow the seed three or four in a spot, 
these spots being eighteen inches apart in the 
rows, and the rows three feet apart. When 
they have vegetated, keep the strongest and 
take away the others, which may be trans- 
planted in continuation after the same plan, 
and, if carefully done, will not be much be- 
hind those that have not been disturbed. 
They may grow on for three seasons with 
nothing more than the earth drawn up to the 
roots, and being kept clear of weeds. Now 
if you have large flower-pots, or kale-pots, 
they may at Christmas be covered over the 
individual plants, and be surrounded by dung 
from the stable or leaves, the plants will 
shoot much sooner than if they were only 
earthed up ; but the least trouble is to earth 
up the rows into a flat-topped bank by digging 
an eighteen-ineh trench between the rows 
and putting the soil that comes out upon the 
plants, covering them eight inches. In the 
spring the plants begin to shoot, and when 



they break the surface it is known that the 
shoots are long enough for the purpose, and 
that they may be uncovered and cut, but 
those under the pots covered with dung or 
leaves will have been forward enough to cut 
weeks before. Sea kale, however, is not an 
economical vegetable, because the ground, 
like an asparagus-bed, is occupied the year 
round for one crop. This can be in part 
counteracted by cropping between the rows 
as soon as the kale is cut, for the bank is then 
levelled, the plants allowed to grow till the 
autumn, and all this time lettuces may be 
planted out and got off the ground ; or spin- 
ach, or a couple or three drills of turnips 
sowed directly the kale is done with, will 
come well into use before the plants need be 
earthed up again. 

CUCUMBER AND VEGETABLE-MARROW. 

If you can sow in a hot-bed a few seeds of 
cucumber and gourds to use as vegetable- 
marrow, and have a spare place in a south 
border to plant them, the chances are that you 
get a good supply of both. Sow them in 
April ; grow them singly in pots till the second 
week in June, stopping the shoots at the 
second joint ; plant them out in June, and 
there will be a good recompense for your 
trouble. The vegetable-marrow must not be 
allowed to grow too large ; they ought to be 
eaten before the seeds are formed : while 
young they are like marrow, but after a cer- 
tain age they become a mere jelly, and when 
they lose their firmness and swell they are 
watery, faint, and unwholesome. 

LETTUCE AND OTHER SALADS. 

Lettuce, corn-salad, small salad, and 
other herbs for the same purposes, may be 
sown each month, but corn-salad is by far the 
most economical of all the small salads, be- 
cause you keep picking from it the leaves, and 
they grow again continually. Lettuces, both 
the cos and the cabbage sorts, may be sown on a 
warm border in February, March, April, May, 
June, and July, and in frames, or with some 
protection, all the rest of the months. They 
may be watered and drawn out for planting 
according as they get strong enough, and 
ground is vacant. There is no season to 
regulate their growth any more than their 
consumption, but it may be taken as a general 
rule that the cabbage kinds are the most 
hardy, and do with least trouble all through 
winter, and that, as they want protection, even 
when sown in February, in an open border, the 
best way is to sow them with onions for pulling 
young, and with radishes to draw young, 
and the same litter that covers for one will 
cover for all. Lettuces ought to be planted 
out a foot apart in the row and eighteen 
inches from row to row. Radishes, like

PRODUCTIVE FAMILY GARDENING. 



other salads, may be sown every month, if 
the demand warrants its being done, but in 
the summer time so many things crowd in 
upon the gardener that he hardly knows what 
to be at, so that he ought well to study not 
only the most useful vegetables, but also those 
which are longest in perfection when once 
produced. 

PEAS. 

Here we have a keeping as well as a 
perishable stock. It is not the most desirable 
crop for persons of limited means, but it is to 
be taken into consideration that what are not 
eaten green are good dry ; there is no reason 
why a man should not grow his peas for soup 
as well as his celery, and no dry peas can be bet- 
ter than those he saves and ripens himself. It is 
a general notion that peas are not split for soup 
and puddings, till they are too old to grow, 
and it may be readily supposed that what a 
man grows himself he can depend on. There 
is no difficulty in bruising peas, and new ones 
shall swell better, and taste better, than old 
ones. Peas, therefore, may be looked upon 
in the light of a double crop, if wanted, or a 
safe crop if saved all for harvest. Of the 
hundreds of varieties in cultivation many 
have very equal claims ; novelty may do 
something for a pea, and, of course, there are 
some which have both novelty and excellence 
to recommend them : we have found all the 
following to be good : — Cormack's Prince 
Albert, Shilling's early grotto, Flask's victory, 
"Ward's incomparable or British Queen, 
Knight's improved dwarf green marrow, 
Groom's dwarf, TVaite's Queen of the dwarfs, 
Girling's Danecroft early, and Inrperial. The 
Early frame, Charlton, and many others, are, 
however, still favourites. Peas may be sown 
from November to July every three weeks, 
but it is for a man to consider whether he 
ought to devote much or little ground to a crop 
which, if eaten green, is a luxury of some 
cost, and if saved dry may cost more than 
they could be purchased for. However, there 
is a great fault among pea growers; they sow 
the seeds much thicker than they ought to be 
sown, and therefore waste a great deal. Peas 
ought to be sown in drills, and if there were 
half the quantity usually sown the crop would 
be heavier ; when up above ground, earth 
ought to be drawn up to their stems ; the 
soil bruised and closed about their roots, and 
brought up to a kind of bank on the cold side 
of them; sticks should be placed to them at the 
same time, and after this they only require to 
be kept clear of weeds and in parching wea- 
ther to have water. 

RHUBARB. 

This has become so general a favourite 
from its wholesomeness and flavour, in sea- 



sons when fruit cannot be had, and is more- 
over so strongly recommended to families, 
that a portion of the garden ought to be de- 
voted to a few good roots — a dozen will be 
found enough for a moderate family, and they 
ought to be two feet from each other every 
way. The ground should be well dressed, the 
plants young, the season autumn. They 
should be planted without bruising their roots, 
and they will do all the rest themselves. If 
wanted earlier in the spring than they will 
come naturally, put a box, or rather a wooden 
trough, two feet high and one foot diameter, 
over a plant, cover the open end that is upper- 
most with a flat tile or a proper cover, and 
surround the whole with dung or leaves ; it 
will hasten the growth : or pot up a strong 
root or two and put them in a warm cellar, 
or a kitchen-cupboard, or [a greenhouse, or 
any other place where the temperature is 
raised ; but it is never so good as from the 
natural ground, grown in the natural way. 

SPINACH. 

The winter spinach is the most useful and 
economical, andis as good in summer time as 
in winter. The difference between this and 
the round-leaved is, that the winter kind takes 
longer to perfect the plant and seed it than 
the round-leaved does, and, therefore, it is 
longer eatable. It is not pulled up as one 
half the spring spinach is, but the leaves are 
picked off from time to time as they grow, and 
a good bed of spinach yields for a long time. 
The round-leaf spinach will be better for the 
same treatment, and looks much larger for it, 
but it is not so long in perfection. Spinach of 
either kind may be sowed in drills eighteen 
inches apart any season, but it is usual to sow 
the round-leaf from January to July, and the 
prickly, or winter, from August to October. 
If it comes up too thick, pick out some when 
they are large enough to eat, and thus thin it, 
when you can use the surplus. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON GENERAL 
SUBJECTS. 

Many other subjects might be mentioned 
under separate heads, but we have gone 
through all that concerns those who wish their 
gardens to be usefully productive ; we have 
not devoted a chapter to the herb bed be- 
cause it is so very simple, and forms a subor- 
dinate part of the establishment, though highly 
useful. It is not very difficult to procure a 
plant or two of sage, mint, thyme, marjoram, 
and other herbs ; and very little of these will 
do for a large family. Parsley is a more 
generally useful herb, and is raised from seed; 
any of the perennial herbs will tear to pieces 
and strike like weeds ; and parsley should be 
sown twice or three times a year, and any 
root whose leaves are not double and curled, 



HEDYOTIS CCERULEA.

should be pulled up. There are many sub- 
jects in a garden that we have not mentioned : 
we have not touched on fruit ; our sole object 
has been to treat of those things which are 
more or less necessaries, or profitable stocks, 
and, although we have treated of several 
things that a man may cultivate as luxuries, 
no person with limited means ought to lose 
sight of the one great object of appropriating 
every rod to something that he can sell if 
he cannot eat it, or that he can keep for a 
considerable time if he can neither sell nor 
eat it. These will be found to have been 
mentioned pretty nearly in the order of their 
importance, taking into the account their 
value as stock or their saleable nature as mer- 
chandise, for such, in truth, food as well as 
raiment is, and when a man can choose the 



stock he will produce, he ought to be doubly con- 
siderate how he misapplies a rod of his ground. 
A gardener is none the better for wanting 
extravagant implements, but proper ones he 
ought to have, for being obliged to make shift 
with one thing for another is a sad loss of 
time. Hoe, rake, fork, spade, garden line, 
knife, good strong box-barrow, broom, bas- 
ket, and dibble ; all these things are neces- 
sary. There is also a proper way of keeping 
them ; they need not be all in morocco cases 
and mahogany boxes, but at the same time 
we should like to see them taken somewhat 
more care of than our artist has bestowed on 
them. To be plain, a gardener, like a 
prudent housewife, should have a place for 
everything, and everything in its place, when 
not in use. 



HEDYOTIS CCERULEA. 

(Hooker.) 
BLUISH-FLOWERED HEDYOTIS. 



This little subject will be more generally 
known, perhaps, under the name of Hous- 
tonia coerulea, which it bears in many gar- 
dens. It is a neat little plant, of the class 
known as "alpines," a name 
given to plants of this habit 
by gardeners not so much 
to indicate that they are 
natives of alpine districts, 
as simply that they are mi- 
nute perennials, suitable, 
from their small size, for 
pot-culture or rock-work, 
and, indeed, requiring some 
such aid to bring them, as 
it were, within the range 
of the eye. The term itself 
was no doubt suggested by 
the fact, that the majority 
of the plants so classed do 
really inhabit alpine dis- 
tricts, and, in many cases, 
this is indicated by their 
bearing the specific name of 
alpina in direct allusion to 
this fact ; and so it be- 
came applied as a collective 
designation to all such cultivated species as 
would agree with them in general appearance 
and in cultivation. Alpines may be considered 
then as minute herbaceous perennials ; there 
are a few shrubby plants — of minute propor- 
tions too — which associate with them, but they 
are exceptions, and consist chiefly of Azalea 
procumbens, and one or two species of Salix, 
or willow, and Rubus, or bramble. 

Hedyotis coerulea is a small tufted plant of 
three or four inches high, with numerous 




erect, spreading, forked stems, spathulate or 
ovate root leaves, the upper ones being ovate- 
lance-shaped, and small salver-shaped flowers, 
the lobes or divisions of which are acute ; the 
colour of the flowers is of 
a light bluish lilac, and 
they are produced in suc- 
cession from May till Au- 
gust. It was introduced 
in 1785, from North Ame- 
rica ; and Virginia and 
Canada are particularly re- 
corded as its localities. It 
has received many names 
besides that here adopted, 
among which are Hous- 
tonia coerulea (Linnseus), 
H. patens (Elliott), H.pu- 
silla (Don), and Anotis 
coerulea (Don). There is 
a recorded variety in which 
the blossoms are white ; 
both are neat and pretty 
plants. 

When grown in small 
pots, the compact tuft 
which it forms, freely 
studded with blossoms, is far from inelegant ; 
and it is best adapted either for pot-culture 
or for placing in the front part of rock -work 
where it will be near the eye. It is of course 
hardy, but if grown in pots would require to 
be slightly sheltered, as with other alpines. 
A sandy peat soil suits it ; the plants should 
be potted at the latter end of summer, they 
have then time to get established before 
winter, and throw out strong blooms in the 
succeeding season.

THE INDIAN AZALEA. 




THE INDIAN AZALEA. 



Of all the beautiful plants brought from 
China, perhaps nothing upon the whole beats 
the Azalea indica; not if we look to the origi- 
nal species or varieties perhaps, because they 
were inferior to their progeny, but we mean 
taking the family as we now possess it. The 
yellow, the purple, the white, and the scarlet, 
were very grand, but very faulty. The splen- 
did varieties, however, produced from seed, 
deserve universal adoption as conservatory 
plants. There are scores, perhaps hundreds 
of varieties now, but looking to the properties, 
there are, perhaps, nearly a dozen of great 
beauty, and possessing excellent points. The 
grand improvement was thickness of petal, 
for, without that, the colours looked watery, 
and the flowers soon faded. There is evidently 
a connexion between tbe rhododendron and the 
azalea, for they have been crossed with the 
greatest advantage. In fact, all the azaleas, 
deciduous and hardy, as well as tender and 
evergreen, seem capable of intermixing, and 
the result has been some very splendid varie- 
ties. The most hardy of the Chinese kinds is, 



the Azalea sinensis, a deciduous shrub, with 
bright yellow flowers, very superior to the 
American varieties, and able to stand a little, 
frost. The Azalea indica is totally distinct 
from all the rest of the azalea and rhododendron 
tribe. The flowers are nearly funnel-shaped, 
with divided edges and sharp points; and we 
have not yet seen any disposition to amalgamate 
with any but their own peculiar kinds. The 
varieties alba, phoenicea and coccinea — white, 
purple, and red — have, by crossing, produced 
all shades, from white to deep purple, and from 
white to deep red, and some variegated with 
spots and stripes exceedingly fine. The most 
conspicuous among the present favourites are, 
Gledstanesii, Variegata, Danielsiana, Cocci- 
nea, Prsestantissima, Splendens, Lateritia, 
Murray ana, and one or two others, either not 
named, or not yet in general cultivation. A 
collection of these, with the most remarkable 
of the few retained for their colour, rather 
than any other quality, would be all that can 
be required for a beginner who wishes to ad- 
vance. These are generally purchased in

fmall pots, and should be grown with great 
care, and apart from any of the common sorts 
which are now spreading abroad in all direc- 
tions, under all sorts of names. 

SOIL. 

The best soil in which to grow this plant is 
decayed turfs, decayed melon bed, and turfy 
peat. This will be found generally light and 
rich, and well adapted to the wants of the 
plant. The turfs should have been cut from 
a meadow of which loam forms the upper spit, 
and should be cut about three inches thick, so 
that all the fibry matter of the roots as well 
as the grass itself should be included. One 
half of this passed through a coarse sieve that 
would let a marble through, one fourth de- 
composed dung from the melon bed, and one 
fourth peat earth also rubbed through the sieve, 
will be found excellent compost. Should it, 
however, in consequence of the quality of the 
loam, which cannot always be controlled, seem 
too adhesive to allow of the water passing 
through freely, add a little silver sand ; but 
it is very unlikely that this will be required. 
Into pots a full inch larger all round, or, 
which is the same thing, two inches wider 
across the top, shift the plants as soon as the 
roots reach the side of their first pot, the 
chance of which is, that they want it immedi- 
ately, but the perfection of this compost is 
merely well mixing it, so that it shall be all 
alike, and laying it in a heap till wanted. 

POTTING AND SHIFTING. 

On turning out the balls of the earth they 
first arrive in, you will observe whether the 
roots have reached the sides. In most cases. 
the nurserymen keep plants in the smallest 
sizes they can, for convenience ; and therefore, 
you mostly find the roots matted so completely 
round the side of the pot as to require imme- 
diate change. Let your pots be very clean, if 
not new : place a few crocks at bottom, and a 
- lump of the turfy peat that would not come 
through the sieve upon the crocks ; then a 
little of the soil, enough to lift the plant to its 
proper position. It is the best way to put a 
sort of cone of the soil, because by pressing the 
plant down, it will give way, and the height is 
easily adjusted. The surface of the ball of 
stale earth should be rubbed off a little, but 
not low enough to touch the fibres or damage 
them ; and the old drainage or crocks that 
may stick to the ball may be taken away, 
unless the fibres of the root are among them. 
The ball thus prepared, may be placed in the 
centre of the fresh pot, and pressed down till 
the collar of the plant is just even with the pro- 
posed new surface. The mould should be put 
in all round, and be gently pressed in with the 
finger as you fill. The plant will then be in 
48 



the centre, and the mould must be filled so as 
just to hide the ball of earth about the plant. 
The plant may now have a little water to 
settle the earth about the roots ; and the pot 
may be placed in a cold frame, shut up for a 
day or two, and then, according to the weather, 
be exposed to the air and warm rains, or 
closed against heavy falls and frosts. There 
is no way of growing these plants better than 
in a cold frame or pit, if there be a capacity 
for keeping the frost out, for that is the only 
thing that is required. Nevertheless, they 
grow well in a moderate greenhouse, and seed- 
lings are always pushed on as fast as possible, 
for the sake of seeing what sort of flowers 
they produce. If a plant is wanted large, it 
may be easily grown in the stove or propa- 
gating house ; and it has been found that they 
bear a considerable degree of heat without 
materially suffering, except, perhaps, that they 
may be drawn up rather, more for want of 
the air than from other cause, and that want 
of air applies to all artificially heated houses, 
because the admission of air lowers the tem- 
perature so much that it is rarely practised to 
an extent that is serviceable, on account of its 
waste of heat. The Azalea can be grown 
rapidly in heat, and if it be moderate, and air 
given frequently, nothing is easier than to 
raise the temperature so high as to enable us 
to admit air, to bring it to the proper heat. For 
beauty, however, and healthy growth, we 
recommend the greenhouse temperature ; 
and as soon as the roots reach the side of 
the pot again, there must be another shift into 
a larger sized pot : so much for potting and 
shifting. But, in the mean time, the plants 
want 

GENERAL MANAGEMENT. 

It depends altogether upon the style of 
plant you want, how you manage them from 
the first growing. If it were the intention to 
let them grow naturally, they would require 
watching, and where any vigorous shoots 
appear inclined to take the lead of others, they 
must be cut back ; but the principal cultiva- 
tors have got into a habit of training this 
beautiful plant very artificially, and the judges 
at horticultural shows have been encouraging 
that peculiarity. We allude to the ungar- 
dener-like mode of making only one front to 
a plant. The fancy for distorting subjects 
that naturally grow elegant, has been too 
much promoted by the horticultural societies. 
The branches have been twisted and turned 
to all manner of shapes, to bring the flowers 
into the front. Props are placed in all direc- 
tions ; the back of the plant is a series of ties, 
and sticks, and battens, like the back of a 
scene in a theatre, and as ugly. If the deter- 
mination is to form these half plants, the only 

B B 



370 



THE INDIAN AZALEA. 



proper way is to do all the distortion while 
the plant is growing, for of a bad business it 
is making the best. "We are no friends to 
distortions of any kind, we only recognise 
proper, legitimate, natural modes of growing 
plants. Nature will sometimes make a stand- 
ard, and at other times a bush of the same kind 
of plant, and we care not how we see a plant 
grown, so that it imitate nature, even if it be- 
in some of her freaks. But to have a plant 
that is naturally a bush forming a flat shield, 
out of all character, and with a mass of flowers 
but no leaves in sight, on a dead flat surface, 
resembling nothing in nature, is to us a bore. 
We have no objection to growing the azalea 
as a standard, as a tall shrub, or a dwarf bush ; 
all these may be formed by nature herself, 
and, consequently, there is no harm in fol- 
lowing her in her most rare and beautiful 
works. 

TO FORM A STANDARD . 

Select a plant with one good upright stem, 
however many lateral branches maybe growing 
out of it. Cut off the lower lateral branches 
close to the centre stem ; as the plant is shifted 
and grows taller, so others of the lateral shoots 
may be taken off; and every two or three 
lateral branches that come out at the top will 
enable you to remove lower ones, until the 
head of the plant is all new growth, and con- 
tinues to grow upwards. Of course the lateral 
branches removed, must be cut very clean and 
neat from the main stem, which must be free 
from spurs or snags. There must always be 
left a few branches towards the top, but the 
object being to gain height, the vigour of the 
plant must be thrown into the top branches, 
and as soon as the lower ones can be spared, 
have them off. So far as this goes, the plant 
need only be shifted as often as it fills jthe pot 
with roots, and continued in its growth. If 
the main stem exhibits any weakness, fasten it 
to a good upright stake thrust in the pot. 
When it has arrived at about the height you 
require, take off the top, and shorten all the 
side shoots. This will occasion lateral shoots 
to grow from all the shortened branches, and 
upon the choice of these, or such of them as 
are best adapted to form the permanent 
branches, depends much of the beauty of the 
future tree. In the next growth, therefore, 
of these shoots, such of them as cross each 
other, or grow inwards or upwards, may be 
either shortened or taken away altogether. 
The object is to leave branches growing out- 
wards on all sides, and to shorten them where 
you want side shoots to thicken the head ; but 
as side shoots will grow naturally, even when 
the main stems are not shortened, we should 
always allow for a little thickening. Upon 
the natural habit of the plant depends how 



large the head may be grown. Some are of 
a weeping habit naturally, and make but a 
small head ; others more robust, are enabled 
to form a good bold tree-like head, and ac- 
cording to their size ought their height to be 
regulated. Standards have been made for 
weeping roses and cytisus, not inapplicable to 
these, something like the skeleton of an um- 
brella, in iron ; by this means, the first or main 
branches would be supported, and the pendent 
shoots, falling over it, and beyond it, would 
look very graceful. But many of the varieties 
of Azalea inclica are robust enough*to require 
no help beyond an upright to support the stem. 
The great object is to so form the main 
branches of the head, as to enable us to prune 
and regulate every year directly after the 
bloom, so that the new growth shall form 
always a pretty nearly close head of foliage, 
every point of which, if properly managed, 
will set for flowers while the standard is grow- 
ing ; after losing the lateral shoots below, small 
shoots will come out all up the stem. These 
must be rubbed off as they first form, but there 
will be no difficulty about managing the head 
according to the taste of the cultivator. No 
head ought to be smaller when full grown, 
than the diameter the same as the length of 
the upright stem; in other words, just as much 
across from one side of the head to the other, 
as the stem is from the pot to the under side 
of the head. 

AS PYRAMIDAL, OR NATURAL BUSHES. 

In this case the plant to be selected should 
have a leader, and be allowed to grow its own 
way, except that when any shoot is more 
vigorous than the rest, and seems inclined to 
take more than its share of nourishment away 
from other parts, that shoot ought to be 
shortened very materially, or cut clean away, 
according as the space it occupied required it 
or not ; at all events it must be shortened far 
enough back to allow of its more vigorous^ 
lateral shoots growing without disturbing the 
form. If any branches cross each other or 
come too thick, there is no harm in cutting 
some clean out. Some kinds are naturally 
tall growing, — the three original kinds are, — 
and it will require but a short time to grow 
phoenicea, alba, and coccinea, six feet high, 
if it were desirable; but while we recom- 
mend the pyramidal, we object to rapid growth. 
We dislike the one-shift system, we object to 
heat ; to be growing freely and healthily is all 
we care about ; shifting them from time to 
time as they fill their pots with roots, and 
watering, covering or uncovering them at 
proper times, so as to give them all the 
benefit of air, proper moisture, and protection 
from cold winds and frost, are all that we care 
about. 



THE INDIAN AZALEA. 



371 



AS DWARF BTJSHY PLANTS. 

This, which we fancy before the last for 
beauty, is as simple as either of the others. 
The plant should be stopped as soon as it is 
obtained, or one should be selected that is 
already bushy, and been served so. All the 
while the plant is growing the shoots are to be 
stopped as soon as they push much ; but it 
must be taken into consideration that many 
grow naturally in a bush, and these are most 
likely to want pruning out instead of shorten- 
ing. Variegata, Lateritia, Gledstanesii, Smithii, 
and some others, are naturally low growers, 
and are almost too confused unless they are 
rather thinned out ; and as it is a good rule 
to shorten nothing until it is too long, care 
need only be taken to take off any shoots that 
are too vigorous for the rest, and thin out 
some when they are too thick. Changing the 
pots goes on alike in all cases, and in that of 
dwarf plants it may perhaps be necessary to 
obtain tall pots, because the plants very often 
spread out and hang over very considerably. 
They are then required tall for the sake of 
appearance, as well as safety or ease in handing 
them about: we have often had the weaker 
kinds hang half way down the pot, and have 
seen the necessity of obtaining some made 
taller in proportion. 

BLOOMING AND SETTING FOR BLOOM. 

After the Azalea has done flowering, you 
should pick off all the buds, unless you desire 
to save seed ; but if seed is the object, let the 
plants have all the mild air they can, all the 
wann rains, and be merely protected from 
heavy rains or other falls. Nothing ever 
answered our purpose for these and other 
hard-wooded plants so well as removing them 
into the tulip-house, when they were sheltered 
from the wind and violent rains by only rolling 
down the canvass roof, or shutting down the 
side canvass blinds. However, as everybody 
has not got a tulip stage or canvass house, and 
may not be inclined to get one or a substitute 
for it, they may be placed inthe most sheltered 
part of the garden, or in the greenhouse, but 
shaded at the top. Out of doors is, however, 
the best in a sheltered spot, if the saving 
of the seed be an object. It is, however, 
doubtful if the bloom will set well after the 
seed has all ripened. It exhausts a plant 
much more to save seed than any body is 
aware of. Those from which no seed is 
required should be stripped of every pod as 
soon as the bloom in the least declines, so as 
to be done with for its flowers. It will 
immediately set off growing without further 
care ; but if on examination of the roots they 
are found to be close to the pot, and inclined 
to be matted, they may have another shift into 



a pot of larger size before they make their new 
growth. While they are progressing they 
should have plenty of moisture ; as soon as 
they have perfected their growth they should 
rest, and have much less water and more 
shade. In the absence of any other con- 
venience, a shady place in the garden and a 
canvass roof put up in a temporary manner, 
will be of great use in turning off the wet and 
keeping off the sun. They have to be placed 
in a cold pit all the winter, but one that can 
be covered up effectually against the frost and 
high winds, hail, rain, &c. They may be 
removed to the greenhouse, or a warmer 
birth still, if they are required to flower 
early ; but as the difficulty is generally how 
to keep them back for the shows, we never 
remove them from the pit unless it is to a cold 
greenhouse. They will flower abundantly 
without forcing, and last four times as long 
in bloom as if they were flowered in heat. 

PROPAGATION BY CUTTINGS. 

This is a very simple process : take off 
cuttings of the present year's growth, and 
place them in a pot, the top half inch of stuff 
being pure silver sand, the lower portion being 
the stuff they grow in ; take the lower leaves 
off the cuttings and stick them into the sand, 
so as just to touch the other soil, cover them 
with a bell-glass, which must be wiped clean 
every morning, and apply moisture to the 
cuttings, so that they shall never get dry. As 
soon as they are struck, which will be indicated 
by their growing, they may be potted off into 
the smallest sized pots, one in each, and after 
waiting a while in the frame, covered with a 
hand glass, they may be removed into the 
greenhouse, or into a pit, to grow and establish 
themselves. In striking cuttings it must be 
remembered that a slight bottom heat will 
hasten the operation, and so far may in some 
cases be useful. The best time for cuttings is 
in the spring, for the shoots that have no 
bloom, and in autumn for the last growth ; 
but young wood will strike almost any how 
and at any time. 

PROPAGATION BY SEED. 

The seed is gathered when indicating ripe- 
ness, and laid by in the dry and warm house 
all the winter. Take a wide mouthed pot in 
spring, with the stuff we grow the plants in, 
and having first levelled the surface, sow the 
seed thinly, and sift some mould very lightly 
through a fine sieve to cover the seed. Cover 
the seed with a glass and place it in the green- 
house or propagating house, or, for want of a 
better place, a common garden frame. As 
soon as the seedlings are large enough to 
handle, prick them out in a number of pots, a full 
inch apart, and replace them in the greenhouse;

cover each pot with a bell-glass, to keep off 
the air and draught till they are established. 
When these grow large enough to nearly 
touch one anothei - , let them be potted off 
singly in thumb-pots, and place them again in 
the greenhouse; here they may be established; 
but they will be fit to turn out into the frames, 
where they may undergo their shift from one 
sized pot fo another until they arrive at the 
blooming period. All this time they are not 
to be pruned nor checked, but left to grow as 
they may, for the purpose of showing their 
natural habit. All the flowers that are not 
better than those we possess already should 
be discarded at once, so as not to fertilize 
others with their secondary qualities. Save 
none but those with petals thick, smooth, and 
of fine texture on the surface, flowers round, 
slightly cupped, and no apparent indenture on 
the edge ; colour either new or good in either 
case the flower would be acceptable. 

MANAGEMENT OF AGED PLANTS. 

In pruning old plants there should always 
be some of the old wood that is most in the 
way cut out, and this should be done rather 
freely upwards, but remove nothing low down, 
if there is a shoot of green upon it ; by using 
the knife freely higher up the plant, good shoots 
will come from below, but if the stems be 
healthy and bare, let them be budded and 
grafted, and as a fancy thing, there may be 
several kinds budded or grafted on one stock. 
If there be a good upright stem that would 
do for a standard, cut away all the rest of the 
shoots from it up to the height you wish to 
have the stem, and retain all the branches you 
can to form, or towards forming, the head ; 
upon every one of these branches, or upon 
alternate ones, graft or bud some distinct 
variety, or any one variety of which you 
desire the tree to be thereafter composed ; or, 
if all the lower portions of a plant are ugly 
and bare, cut the plant down and graft or bud 
all the ends as well as putting a bud close to 
the bottom of every branch ; the buds and 
grafts will grow rapidly, and in one season 
there will be a completely renovated plant. 
If the variety be a favourite one the grafts 
may all be of the same ; but the old wood will 
not always break when cut down, so that 
grafting and budding is the only way to make 
sure. A good old plant, however, will often 
give one good stem for a standard, and that is 
the most desirable thing to make of it. 

PROPERTIES. 

1. The flower should be round, composed of 
five divisions, though only one petal; and the 
indentures, where they join, should be so small 
as not to materially interrupt the circle. 

2. The petal should be thick, and of course 



to be round the ends of the divided portions 
should be blunt, lap over each other, and be 
free from notch, serrature, or blemish. 

3. The flower should be large and slightly 
cupped ; the colour should be distinct, dense, 
and if a self, alike in all the petals, or rather 
the divisions. 

4. If variegated, the colours should be dis- 
tinct, and, if spotted, the spots should be so 
much darker than the other colour as to form 
a strong contrast. 

5. The leaf should be bright green ; the 
plant shrubby, the wood or stems strong, to 
stand without support, and short, to form a 
compact bush. 

The great faults of the present favourite 
varieties are flimsy, pointed flowers, weak 
stems, straggling plants, dingy foliage ; and, 
beautiful as they may look, they can be im- 
proved greatly in two years. The two years 
are up, and some very beautiful varieties fully 
realize this prediction. 

MONTHLY DIRECTIONS. 

January. — Now we have young seedlings 
in the greenhouse, and the general stock of 
older plants in cold frames, pits, or a house 
kept cool on purpose. The former, that is to 
say, young seedlings, not being so robust, must 
have air admitted very carefully, and, unless 
the weather be very mild, sparingly ; for cold 
winds (that would not affect older plants) 
would injure them. The plants in pits and 
frames must be well protected from frost 
by covering, but in mild weather may have 
the glasses entirely removed, and air should 
be given at all times when there is no frost. 

February. — Examine the roots by taking 
out some of the balls of earth, and if the fibres 
are matted round the side of the ball, give 
them larger pots, carefully filling the earth 
round the ball, and shaking it well down, and 
if necessary pressing it down with a bit of 
wood. You may safely increase the size two 
inches in diameter. Stir the surface of the 
soil in all those that do not require shifting. 
If the fibres of the seedlings in the house have 
reached the pots, give the plants a shift to one 
a size larger. Sow seed ; they now begin to 
require watering. 

March. — The buds are now swelling for 
bloom, and wherever plants are subject to 
stronger light on one side than the other, turn 
the plants daily that they may flower all round 
alike. If any are trained with their branches 
to show but one face 1 they must be examined, 
and any branches that are loose should be tied 
carefully into their places, because all plants 
are now growing, and the face can never be 
made good afterwards if it be not done while 
growing ; nothing makes a plant look worse 
than any tying that shows the backs of the

leaves ; and when a branch is turned out of 
its natural position it will do so for days. Look 
well to watering ; sow seed if not sown before. 

April. — Many flowers are now opening, 
and seedlings which do not bloom are growing 
fast ; look to shifting all that require it, which 
can be told by taking one or two out of the 
pot, the ball of earth being kept entire. The 
blooming plants must now be shaded from the 
extreme heat of the sun, as it would hasten 
the flowers too much, and make their period 
of perfection very short. Turn all the naturally 
grown plants daily, that the light may have 
equal influence all round ; look well to the 
watering. 

May. — The plants are now in perfection of 
bloom, and require only shading and watering 
to keep them so as long as possible. Seedling 
plants will keep on growing, and may require 
removing to larger pots ; they nday be taken 
from the greenhouse to the pits or frames at 
the end of the month, and have all the air 
that can be given them. The seed sown in 
February will be up, and perhaps large enough 
to prick out, for they should be put out as 
soon as they are large enough to handle well. 
They should, after pricking out, have a hand- 
glass put over them, although they are in the 
greenhouse. Select the best, and throw 
away the useless varieties among blooming 
seedlings. 

June. — Prick out seedlings, remove the 
plants that have done blooming into the shade 
and shelter. If the form of the plant requires 
any correction, use the knife. If the branches 
are too thick, there may be here and there one 
removed. The decayed blooms may be all 
picked off, unless the seed is wanted, in which 
case the plant may be put out of doors just as 
it is. The plant will grow fast, and when 
any of the branches are too vigorous, shorten 
or stop them, because as the plant is allowed 
to form so it sets its bloom, and any alteration 
then'removes the flowers. 

July. — Attend to the advancing seedlings. 
They must not be too wet ; but by no means 
must they be neglected, as a short time with- 
out necessary moisture would kill them. The 
hand-glass may be removed from the small 
seedlings in the greenhouse, as they will 
require air. Attend to the necessary shifting 
of growing plants. The larger plants have 
made a good deal of their growth, and require 
great attention to the watering. 

August. — Continue the treatment of last 
month. Keep the established plants that 
have now made their growth, or nearly so, in 
a cool place still. Shift all the seedlings that 
may want it ; and if the young seedlings are 
large enough, pot them off in sixty sized pots, 
one in a pot. Pick the seed pots, if ripe. 

September. — The plants may now be 



placed in their winter quarters. The surface 
of the earth should be stirred, and a little 
fresh earth be put with it to fill the pots up 
properly, and they must have only as much 
water as will keep a little moisture in the 
compost. This must not be done by giving 
little at a time, but by doing it less frequently. 
The seedlings as last month. Pot off all that 
are not already potted. 

October. — No plants require much less 
care in winter. Keep them from frost and 
excess of wet, and they are almost sure to do 
well. Deep pits, or the greenhouse, will do 
for the largest, a common frame will do for the 
smaller ones, and the shelves at the top of the 
greenhouse will do for the young seedlings. 

November. — Nothing more than giving 
plenty of air, little water, and keeping them 
clean, are now required by the Azaleas. Seed- 
lings that are growing very fast will require 
examining occasionally to see that the roots do 
not fill the pot, and to give them timely shifts 
into those of a larger size. The frames and 
pits should be kept dry and clean, free from 
dead leaves and weeds. 

December. — Continue last month s treat- 
ment, attending to the wants of seedlings in 
small pots, because they soon dry and damage ; 
change their pots as often as they require it, 
and keep them growing. The greenhouse is 
an excellent temperature in general for seed- 
lings that have not arrived at blooming size 
and age, for they keep growing all through 
the winter. 

DESCRIPTIVE LIST OF INDIAN AZALEAS. 

The blooms of the varieties of Azalea in- 
dica are usually more or less spotted on the 
upper segment of the flower, sometimes on the 
three upper ones. Most of the annexed de-

duced at the different metropolitan exhibitions. 

Agnesii ; colour light scarlet, slightly 
spotted ; flowers small, with broadish segments. 

Alba com/pacta ; colour white ; flower 
moderate size, of good form ; better than ledi- 
folia. 

Alba magniflora ; colour white, delicately 
marked with a few streaks of rosy purple ; 
flowers large, with rather long segments.

ritia, Variegata, Triumphans, Optima, and Re- 
fulgens. 

The sorts of Azalea indica recommended 
in the Garden Almanac as the best, are Pres- 
tantissima, Variegata, Murrayana, Gledstanesii, 
Splendens, Lateritia, Danielsiana. There is a 
large white one grown at Falkirk far superior 
to our ordinary Alba. We should grow Azalea 
sinensis among them, most assuredly, and do 
our best towards seeding from it after cross 
fertilization ; it would probably originate some 
handsome varieties.

T0REN1A ASIATICA. 




TORENIA ASIATICA. 

(Linn/Bvs.) 

ASIATIC, OR LARGE FLOWERED TOEENIA. 



To this pretty genus of plants we have ' 
recently Lad some accessions, which will be- 
come valuable ornaments of our gardens. 
The best, in every respect, is that of which 
an engraving is here introduced : nothing can 
exceed it in the richness and the softness of 
its colouring. 

In noticing this plant on a former occasion, 
(Annals of Horticulture, ii. 553,) we took 
the oppm-tunity of expressing a doubt whe- 
ther the statement that the plant was an 
annual was strictly correct. The statement 
was made in the Botanical Jfagazine, where 
a beautiful figure of it was published last 
year. Nothing in the appearance of the plant, 
at the time our notice above referred to was 
written, would seem to warrant the belief 
that the plant was annual, and our further 
experience of it does but confirm our former 
supposition : hundreds of plants raised from 
cuttings last year, along with calceolarias, 
cupheas. and similar sub-shrubby plants, have 
been preserved through the winter, and 
planted out into the flower garden; and the 
old plants which blossomed last season are 
now vigorous, and blossoming freely again. 



It was. moreover, said to be a stove plant, 
but this, too, is incorrect; for it has been 
preserved during winter in the temperature 
of a greenhouse, and has been grown and 
flowered well in such a situation. Moreover, 
experience has shown it to be a plant suitable 
for bedding out in flower gardens, though 
here, we presume, it will always be found to 
do best in the warmest situations, all other 
conditions being equal. 

The plant is of diffuse branching habit, 
with quadrangular, flexuose stems, bearing 

I opposite ovate, or ovate-lanceolate, coarsely 
serrated leaves, from the axils of which other 
branches, and towards the tips of the shoots 
numerous flowers, are produced ; the flowers 
grow on separate stalks, but sometimes seve- 
ral — three or four — together, from the same 
axil; they are shaped something like the 

! flowers of a mimulus, only they are divided 
into four instead of five lobes, the lower of 

; which, and the two side ones, each bear a 

. large deep purple blotch, and the throat, or 
centre, is of the same colour ; down the cen- 

: tre of the lower segment is a pale streak; 
the rest of the flower is a clear, soft, porce-

lain blue-lilac, of indescribable tint. It is a 
very free flowering plant, blooming through- 
out the summer and autumnal months. 

Viewing the extensive range which it 
occupies in a wild state, one would be pre- 
pared to find it possessing much hardihood of 
constitution, even though it be East Indian. 
It is recorded as growing throughout Bengal, 
in Amboyna, Ceylon, Mergui, Chittagong, 
Sylhet, and in the Madras peninsula. It is 
also widely diffused in alpine regions, and 
hence our success in cultivating it in a low 
temperature. 

The plant is easily cultivated in any light 
rich soil, and propagates with the utmost 
facility by means of cuttings. Probably its 
beautiful tint of colour will be best brought 
out and preserved by affording it some shade 
from intense sun-light. 

We may take the opportunity of again men- 
tioning Torenia concolor (Lindley), as a 
handsome species. It appears to be of a more 
trailing habit than T. asiatica, and its flowers 
are of a uniform violet colour, except the 
throat, which is deeper tinted. Mr. Fortune 
found this growing in marshy ground, on the 
mountains of Hong-Kong, where it bears much 
cold and drought in the winter season, but 
grows and flowers profusely in the hot damp 
months of summer. In this country, it should 
be treated during the growing season as a 
half-stove plant ; and it requires a trellis, 
unless the pot be elevated, and the branches 
are allowed to become dependent.

Under this title we reviewed Lady Cal- 
cott's admirable work, written under great 
bodily infirmity and suffering, but, neverthe- 
less, produced in a way that did great honour 
to the head and the heart of the fair authoress: 
we adopt the same head for a review of the 
noble volumes lately published under the 
title of the " Cyclopaedia of Biblical Litera- 
ture ;"* because, although it touches upon 
every subject mentioned in the sacred book, 
flowers and plants form a considerable portion, 
and belong especially to us. The work has 
been produced with great labour ; the con- 
tributors comprise a host of talented men, 
and the manner in which each subject is 
handled shows a degree of research and labour 
scarcely surpassed by any modern writers. 
In fact, as we are told in the preface —

this great harvest. And as the ground seemed, 
for the most part, common to all Christian 
men, it appeared desirable that assistance 
should be sought from a sufficient number of 
competent Biblical scholars, and others, with- 
out distinction of country or religious party, 
that the field might be the more thoroughly 
swept, and the greater wealth of illustration 
obtained from men of different lines of read- 
ing, and various habits of thought. The 
prompt manner in which the call of the Editor 
for co-operation has been met by the numerous 
eminent Biblical scholars and naturalists, 
whose names appear in the List of Contri- 
butors, has been amongst the highest grati- 
fications arising to him out of this undertaking; 
while the ability, the laborious research, the 
care and the punctuality, with which they 
have discharged the various tasks confided to 
them, demand his warmest acknowledgments." 

Without touching upon theological points, 
which we leave to those who read the work, 
we are bound to say, that a more valuable 
accumulation of facts, touching natural his- 
tory, cannot be found, than are now before 
us. The writers may be all called great men, 
close reasoners, full of sound argument ; and, 
for the most part, they draw conclusions per- 
fectly convincing. We will not pretend that 
we agree with all they say, nor do we alto- 
gether exculpate some of the writers from a 
charge of elaborating too much upon trifles, 
or things of small importance ; but with all 
the imaginary, and a few real faults, it is one 
of the most able productions of modern times. 
The principal portion of the articles on flowers 
and plants, if not the whole of them, are by 
Professor Eoyle. Perhaps no subject has 
given rise to more speculation than the lily, 
mentioned by our Saviour in his sermon on 
the mount : and we are sorry that Professor 
Royle persists in the extraordinary delusion 
that Christ referred to some one species, when 
it is plain to any man of common sense, or 
should be so, that our Saviour applied the 
language to all ; " Behold," says he, " the 
lilies of the field how they grow, they toil not, 
neither do they spin ;" yet, in the teeth of 
this passage we find commentators haggling 
with one another as to which one species could 
have been meant. We have hardly common 
patience with those who fancy they show their 
talent by disputations as unprofitable as they 
are groundless. However, let us do the writer 
justice ; there is a vast deal of information in 
his general articles : take, for instance, that 
on the melon, from which we select a few 
passages that more immediately concern the 
lovers of a garden, while we omit the more 
learned portions that relate to the translation 
of particular words, and the reconciliation

of partial facts, •which we look upon as 
very immaterial. 

" The Cucurbitaceae, or gourd tribe, are re- 
markable for their power of adapting themselves 
to the different situations where they can be 
grown. Thus, Mr. Elphinstone describes 
some of them as 3d elding large and juicy fruit 
in the midst of the Indian desert, where water 
is 300 feet from the surface. Extreme of 
moisture, however, is far from injurious to 
them, as the great majority are successfully 
cultivated in the rainy season in India. Mr. 
Moorcroft describes an extensive cultivation 
of melons and cucumbers on the beds of weeds 
which float on the lakes of Cashmere. They 
are similarly cultivated in Persia and in China. 
In India, ' some of the species may be seen in 
the most arid places, others in the densest 
jungles. Planted at the foot of a tree, they 
emulate the vine in ascending its branches; 
and near a hut, they soon cover its thatch 
with a coating of green. They form a prin- 
cipal portion of the culture of Indian gardens; 
the farmer even rears them in the neighbour- 
hood of his wells.' (Royle, Himalayan Bo- 
tany, p. 218.) 

" These plants, though known to the 
Greeks, are not natives of Europe, but of 
Eastern countries, whence they must have 
been introduced into Greece. They probably 
may be traced to Syria or Egypt, whence 
other cultivated plants, as well as civilisation, 
have travelled westwards. In Egypt they 
formed a portion of the food of the people at 
the very early period when the Israelites were 
led by Moses from its rich cultivation into 
the midst of the desert. The melon, the 
water-melon, and several others of the cucur- 
bitaceas, are mentioned by "Wilkinson {Thebes, 
p. 212; Ancient Egyptians, iv. 62), as still 
cultivated there, and are described as being 
sown in the middle of December, and cut, the 
melons in ninety and the cucumbers in sixty 
days. 

" If we consider that the occurrences so 
graphically detailed in the Bible, took place in 
the East, we should expect, among the natu- 
ral products noticed, that those which appear 
from the earliest times to have been esteemed 
in these countries, w r ould be those mentioned. 
But as all are apt to undervalue the good 
which they possess, and think of it only when 
beyond their reach, so the Israelites in the 
desert longed for the delicious coolness of the 
melons of Egypt. Among these we may sup- 
pose both the melon and water-melon to have 
been included, and therefore both will be 
treated of in this article." 

" All travellers in Eastern countries have 
borne testimony to the refreshment and delight 
they have experienced from the fruit of the 



melon. But we shall content ourselves with 
referring to Alpinus, who, having paid par- 
ticular attention to such subjects, says of the 
Egyptians, ' Fructibus, &c. se replent, ut ex 
iis solis saspe ccenam, vel prandium perficiant 
cujusmodi sunt precocia, cucurbitae, pepones, 
melopepones ; quorum quidern nomen gene- 
ricum est Batech.' (Rerum ^3Sgypt. Hist. 
i. 17.) He also describes in the same chap- 
ter the kind of melon called Abdellavi, which, 
according to De Sacy, receives its name from 
having been introduced by Abdullah, a gover- 
nor of Egypt, under the Khalif Al Mamoon. 
It may be a distinct species, as the fruit is 
oblong, tapering at both ends, but thick in 
the middle ; a figure (tab. xli.) is given in his 
work, De Plantis JEgypti ; but Forskal 
applies this name also to the Chate, which is 
separately described by Alpinus, and a figure 
given by him at tab. xl." 

" The water-melon is clearly distinguished 
by Alpinus as cultivated in Egypt, and called 
by the above names, ' quae intus semina tan- 
tum, et aquam dulcissimam continent.' It is 
mentioned by Forskal, and its properties 
described by Hasselquist. Though resem- 
bling the other kinds very considerably in its 
properties, it is very different from them in 
its deeply-cut leaves, from which it is com- 
pared to a very different plant of this tribe — 
that is, the colocynth. ' Citrullus folio colo- 
cynthidis secto semine, nigro.' A few others 
have cut leaves, but the water-melon is so 
distinguished among the edible species. The 
plant is hairy, with trailing cirrhiferous stems. 
The pulp abounds so much in watery juice, 
that it will run out by a hole made through 
the rind ; and it is from this peculiarity that 
it has obtained the names of water-melon, 
melon d'eau, wasser-melon. Hasselquist says 
that it is cultivated on the banks of the Isile, 
in the rich clayey earth which subsides during 
the inundation, and serves ' the Egyptians 
for meat, drink, and physic. It is eaten in 
abundance, during the season, even by the 
richer sort of people ; but the common people, 
on whom Providence hath bestowed nothing 
but poverty and patience, scarcely eat any- 
thing but these, and account this the best 
time of the year, as they are obliged to put 
up with worse at other seasons of the year."'

The article Garden is treated with consi- 
derable power, and the authorities referred to 
are too numerous for us to notice ; some of 
the information is new and curious. After 
noticing the various allusions to gardens, the 
writer proceeds to inform us that — 

" Gardens were dedicated to various uses 
among the Hebrews, such as we still find 
prevailing in the East. One most essential

difference between them and our own is, that 
they are not attached to, or in any way con- 
nected with, the residence, but are situated in 
the suburbs. "We have known gardens from 
half a mile to a mile distant from the houses 
of the persons to whom they belonged. It is 
manifest that all the gardens mentioned in 
Scripture were outside the several towns. 
This is, however, to be understood of regular 
gardens, for shrubs and flowers were often 
planted in the open courts of the dwelling- 
houses. 

" People repair to then' suburban gardens 
to take the air, to walk, and to refresh and 
solace themselves in various ways. For then" 
use there is mostly in each garden a kind of 
summer-house, or pavilion, fitted up with 
much neatness, gaily painted, and furnished 
with seats, where the visitants may sit and 
enjoy themselves." — Pp. 735, 736. 

In this article we have an account of the 
various kinds of gardens, and the uses to 
which they were put. How they were made 
by the side of, or near streams, for the sake 
of irrigation ; we have, also, examples of the 
different modes of applying water, and of pro- 
curing it ; the plan of raising it from w T ells 
by levers, after the fashion adopted to the pre- 
sent day in many nursery-grounds, was a very 
ancient practice ; but there were rills for 
water formed all over the garden, and when 
it was raised, it was poured into these, to run 
wherever the place was left open, and was, 
by the simplest means, stopped out of one set 
of rills, and directed into another. The fol- 
lowing notions will rather surprise those who 
have not already been made acquainted with 
the circumstance by reading : — 

" The Jews, in their ceremonial treatises, 
have frequent occasion to mention gardens, 
chiefly for the purpose of showing what plants 
or seeds might or might not be planted or 
sown together under the law against hetero- 
geneous propagations. (Lev. xix. 9 ; Deut. 
xxi. 9, 11.) Prom this source some curious 
facts relating to the arrangements of gardens 
may be gleaned. The following are from the 
Mishnic treatise Kilaim, which is devoted to 
the general subject : ' Trees must not be 
grafted on trees of a different kind, nor one 
kind of shrub on another kind of shrub, nor 
yet trees on shrubs, nor shrubs on trees.' 
Rabbi Jehudah, however, sanctioned this last 
practice. ' Shrubs must not be planted in a 
sycamore-bush ; rue must not be grafted on 
white cassia, because that would be a shrub 
on a tree ; a scion of the fig tree must not be 
planted among chatzub, (supposed 'ivy,') to 
cool it; a vine branch must not be sunk 
(trained) into a melon bed, to instil its j uices 
therein, because that is a tree on a plant; 



pumpkin-seed must not be set among mallow, 
in order that it may be preserved therein, 
as that is herb in herb.' ' In a garden-bed, 
that is six hands square, fiVe different kinds 
of seeds may be sown, namely, four kinds in 
the four corners of the bed, and a fifth in the 
centre. If the bed has a ridge (border), thir- 
teen different kinds may be sown, three in 
each corner, and one in the middle of the 
bed.' ' All kinds of field-seeds must not be 
sown in a garden bed ; but all kinds of herbs 
(garden-seed) may be sown therein.' ' A 
ridge (border) that had been one hand high, 
but is decreased in height, still remains good, 
because it had been originally of lawful 
height.' This applies, of course, to the ridges 
by which different plants which might not 
lawfully mingle were separated. ' In a trench, 
or dry kennel, one hand deep, three different 
kinds of seeds may be sown, namely, one 
kind on each side, and one kind in the 
middle.' 

"It is very evident that where such careful 
distinctions and rules of separation existed, 
great attention must have been required to 
the means of dividing the different plants 
from each other. This was effected not only 
by ridges and trenches, but by light fences of 
cane. This apppears from what follows : 
' A partition of cane is considered a fence, 
provided the space between each cane is less 
than three hands wide, so that a young kid 
cannot pass through. If there is a breach in 
the fence to the extent of ten amoth, it is con- 
sidered as a gate (entrance). Should a greater 
portion of the fence be broken down, it is 
unlawful to sow or plant towards the breach. 
If there are several breaches in the fence, 
should the portion still standing be greater 
than that broken down, it is permitted ; but 
should the portion broken down be greater 
than that standing, it is forbidden.' These 
examples are selected only as specimens of 
the endless modes by which the later Jews 
sought to carry out with minute and impos- 
sible exactness the useful regulation of the 
Mosaical law. Por that law various reasons 
have been given, on which we are not re- 
quired to pronounce any judgment ; but it 
appears to us that the economical grounds 
which may be collected from the effects which 
appear to result from the interdicted practices, 
are quite sufficient in themselves, whether 
others exist or not. Thus we find enumerated 
among the radical defects of Hindu husbandry 
— ' the barbarous system of sowing two or 
three species of grain in one field .... The 
mode of reaping is equally defective ; if two 
or three species of grain are sown in the same 
field, the Indian husbandman treads down a 
great part of his crop, in order to collect each 
kind separately ; indeed, so fond is he of this 



380

method of proceeding, that he pursues it even 
when the crop is all of one kind, that he may 
select what he deems the ripest.' (Tennant's In- 
dian Recreations, in Mdinb. Review, iv. 320.) 
" There is no reason to suppose that the 
gardens of the ancient Jews differed in any 
material respect from those which are still 
found in Palestine. Such difference as did 
exist was doubtless occasioned chiefly by the 
minute rules which were founded upon the law 
forbidding the intermixture of diverse plants 
and seeds. The gardens of the Holy Land 
have been mentioned by travellers in terms 
too vague and general to afford the basis of a 
satisfactory description. Dr. Olin seems to 
have paid most attention to them. Of the 
gardens near Shechem, he says, ' Upon turn- 
ing an angle in the steep gorge, we found 
ourselves, as if by enchantment, in the midst 
of fruitful gardens filled with vegetables, 
flowers, and fruit-trees, and all in the highest 
perfection of luxuriance and beauty. Olives, 
vines, acacias, pomegranates, figs, mulberries, 
and several species of trees which I did not 
recognise, are crowded together in small en- 
closures, forming an impervious shade, as well 
as an impenetrable thicket ; and yet the capa- 
bilities of the soil seem not to be overburdened. 
Each separate tree and plant thrives to admi- 
ration, and seems rather to profit than suffer 
from the thick dark canopy of branches 
and foliage, which entirely excludes the sun's 
rays from the tangled huddle of trunks and 
roots. A beautiful mountain stream runs 
through the midst of this forest of gardens, 
in a channel mostly artificial, and sometimes 
covered ; but the water often rises into small 
fountains, and forms several cascades.' {Tra- 
vels in the East, ii. 350.) The orange and 
citron trees, which abound in these gardens 
near Shechem, (see Schubert, Reise ins Mor- 
genlande, ii. 116,) were probably those not re- 
cognised by Dr. Olin, from their not being in 
fruit at the time of his visit." — Pp. 736, 737. 

Geometrical gardens were not, it seems, 
unknown, nor unappreciated by the ancients, 
but we are not quite sure they were contrived 
after our present notions. It would seem 
they approved of large gardens being laid out 
so, while we rather limit a geometrical gar- 
den to a space that the eye can command at 
once, with all the figures displayed, at a glance; 
as if their whole gardens must be uniform, 
instead of the eye wandering over rich land- 
scape, and falling upon a well-managed figure, 
like one of the views in a kaleidoscope, in 
some pleasant nook, which is our notion of 
the place for a geometrical garden. Upon 
this subject the author says : — 

" ' The ancient plans of gardens show that 
the Egyptians were not less fond than our 



ancestors of mathematical figures, straight 
walks, architectural decorations, and vege- 
table avenues ; and that they as thoroughly 
entered into the idea of seclusion and safety 
suggested by enclosures within enclosures. 
It has been remarked that, in some old En- 
glish places, there were almost as many walled 
compartments without, as apartments within 
doors ; and the same may be said of Egyptian 
country houses. This principle of seclusion, 
and an excessive love of uniform arrangement, 
are remarkably displayed in the plan of a large 
square garden, given in Professor Rosellini's 
great work, I Monumenti dell' Ecjitto. Here — 

" Grove nods at grove, each alley has a brother, 
And half the platform just reflects the other." 

This royal garden must have formed a most 
enviable retreat from "the intolerable day" 
of an Egyptian summer. The whole was 
shut in by an embattled wall. On one side, 
a canal runs along just without the walls. In 
the centre of the enclosure is an oblong walled 
vineyard ; the vines, planted in rows, or ave- 
nues, are trailed above on trellis-work, form- 
ing shady arched walks. The space on one 
side this central vineyard exactly corresponds 
to that on the other. In each there is a row 
of palms, an oblong tank with water-fowl, 
four flower-beds on a lawn, and an open 
summer-house on the margin overlooking the 
pool ; an oblong walled compartment of trees ; 
a second tank with water-fowl and flowers ; 
and all along within the wall of circuit, a row 
of trees, of three kinds, in regular alternations. 
At one end of the garden, next the entrance, 
is a building containing apparently one large 
room, perhaps for the royal entertainments ; 
at the other end, or back, is a house of three 
stories, which commanded a view of the whole. 
This garden, with its sheltered walks, its 
groves and tanks of water, its seclusion and 
privacy, reminds us of the " fair garden" of 
Joacim at Babylon, with its baths, its deep 
shady coverts, and its " privy gate," in the 
apocryphal story of Susannah.' " — P. 737. 

We shall close our quotations here, for we 
have given enough to show the nature of 
those articles which belong peculiarly to our 
subject. The articles on natural history, 
geology, entomology, and the arts and sciences 
of the ancients, are exceedingly clever and 
deeply interesting, and the embellishments are 
numerous, well executed, and elaborate. We 
therefore commend Dr. Kitto's volumes ; they 
present a rich intellectual treat for the in- 
quiring mind ; indeed we hardly know where 
else to look for so large a proportion of amuse- 
ment and instruction, combined, too, as the 
whole range of subjects necessarily are, with 
much that is calculated to improve not only 
the mind but the heart. 



TROP.EOLTJM SPECIOSUM.

TEOP^OLUM SPECIOSUM. 
(Pceppig.) 

THE BEAUTIFUL INDIAN CHESS. 



The family of Indian cresses is in high 
favour in our gardens. About a score species 
are known and cultivated; and if in comparison 
some of these may be held — as they rightfully 
are — to be superior in beauty to others of 
their congeners, on the other hand, there is 
not a known species which can be regarded 
as anything else than an epitome of graceful- 
ness and elegance. Even the common kind, 
Tropceolum majus,ihe nasturtium of the kitchen 
garden, is a gorgeous plant when clothed with 
bloom, as it is during great part of the sum- 
mer. Another annual and smaller, though 
similar kind, T. minus, is equally beautiful, 
and still more elegant. The yellow-fringed 
annual kind, T. aduncum, known commonly 
in gardens as the canary-flower (and hence, 
erroneously called T. canariensis), is one of 
the gayest of rapid growing summer climbers. 
Then everybody who knows anything of orna- 
mental greenhouse plants is familiar with the 
perennial, or tuberous-rooted kinds which are 
usually cultivated there in pots, and their 
branches trained over ornamental trellises : 
there is T. tricolor with its horn-like flowers 
of scarlet, orange, and black ; T. brachyceras, 
with yellow blossoms, and T. azureum, with 
flowers of a soft bluish tint ; these are each of 
slender habit, with deeply divided leaves. 
Rather more vigorous is the T. Moritzianum, 
which has elegant red and orange flowers ; 
and still more robust is an eatable-rooted kind 
— (most, if not all, are so employed by the 
South Americans of their native countries) — 
called T. tuberosum, which produces roots as 
large as ordinary sized potatoes, but requires 
to be planted in gravel, and placed in a hot 



sunny exposure to cause it to develop its 
floral beauty. 

The structure of the flowers of TropaBolums 
is somewhat singular. They have a calyx or 
outer covering of five segments, and this part 
is lengthened behind into a more or less de- 
veloped organ which is called the spur ; within 
the calyx is a corolla of five petals, and, of 
course, within these, the anthers and pistil. 
Owing to a remarkable difference in the de- 
gree of development in the calyx, the corolla 
and the spur, there is, to a superficial ob- 
server, perhaps, as much diversity in the 
appearance of the flowers of different species 
of the genus as can be found in any family of 
the same extent. In the common garden nas- 
turtium, for example, the calyx and spur are 
but moderately developed, whilst the petals 
being highly developed, a large wide open 
blossom is the result; and the spur is not 
very obvious except on a side view. In the 
case of T. brachyceras and T. azureum, the 
spur is still less developed compared with the 
size of the petals. In T. tricolor, on the 
other hand, neither calyx nor petals are very 
evident, but the spur is highly developed, and 
appears to constitute the entire blossom : in 
this case, an entirely different appearance is 
produced. So also in the case of T. aduncum, 
in which, while the spur is present and 
hooked, the two upper petals are large and 
conspicuous, the three lower ones being so 
small and narrow as to be almost unobserved. 
This diversity of appearance, no doubt, forms 
a recommendation additional to their intrinsic 
beauty. 

Trojpmolum speciosum is the most recent

introduction to our gardens. It is a very dis- 
tinct and very handsome kind. The habit is 
climbing, branching, and moderately vigorous, 
in the way of T. pentaphyllum and T. tri- 
color. The leaves are formed of six leaflets 
or lobes, arranged on the stalks so as to be- 
come, in general outline, nearly what is called 
peltate* or shield-formed ; these leaflets or 
lobes are obtusely-oblong, and slightly mu- 
cronate, and they are, moreover, hairy be- 
neath ; the anterior segment is nearly twice 
as large as the posterior one : at the base of 
each footstalk is a pair of small three-cleft 
stipules. The blossoms are large — upwards 
of an inch in diameter — and entirely red ; the 
spur is long and slightly curved ;. the petals, 
which are of a very rich crimson red, are sin- 
gularly formed ; the two upper are very nar- 
rowly wedge-shaped, the three lower ones 
consist of a longish slender thread-like claw, 
with an expanded blade, squared at the base, 
and slightly lobed and rounded at the apex ; 
the effect of these oddly-shaped petals is very 
singular and distinct. The flowers are very 
freely produced, and, doubtless, as in the other 
kinds, may be had almost at any period of the 
summer, according to the period when the 
plants are set growing'; during the present 
year, which is the first of its blooming in this 
country, the plant has been well furnished both 
in June and July. On its native hills it 
blooms in February and March. 

Messrs. Veitch and Son, nurserymen of 
Exeter, are the fortunate possessors of this 
elegant species : they have, indeed, been par- 
ticularly successful with the family, having pre- 
viously, and within a comparatively recent pe- 
riod, introduced three other very ornamental 
kinds, especially T. azureum and T. Lobhi- 
anum. We are indebted to them for the ma- 
terials from which the accompanying sketch 
and description have been prepared. They 
received living plants in the autumn of 1846 
from Mr. Yfilliam Lobb, who discovered it in 
the Andes of Patagonia, near the snow line. 
It has bloomed with them for the first time 
in England during the present summer, and 
is found to be a plant of vigorous growth and 
an abundant bloomer. It is probable that, 
like T. pentaphyllum,, which it a good deal 
resembles in habit, it will prove nearly hardy; 
that is to say, its tuberous roots will most likely 
live through the winter in light soils and in dry 
situations, witli the slightest possible surface 
protection, such, for instance, as that afforded 
by a layer three inches thick of dry sawdust, 
or of short loose litter ; and in the spring 
would throw up their young stems with re- 
markable vigour. 



* Roundish, -with the stalk attached behind, at a 
distance from the margin. 



We have but little else to add respecting it. 
It belongs to the natural order Tropgeolaceas ; 
and most probably will prove to be one of 
that group of species of which T. pentaphyl- 
lum is the type, and to which the name of 
Chymocarpus has been applied. It is one of 
the most elegant novelties of the present 
season. 

PRACTICAL EDUCATION. 

There are some branches of knowledge 
which ought to be common to all classes, and 
the sooner all men attain it the better. The 
chances of emigration from choice or neces- 
sity should induce men to teach their children 
all the ordinary operations connected with the 
productions of the vegetable world. No man 
should be ignorant of what is called kitchen 
gardening, and cheap lessons on that subject 
are both plentiful and easily understood. The 
practical part of gardening can only be known 
by practice, but all the practical rules may be 
so engrafted in the mind of a youth, that prac- 
tice will come easy when occasion calls for it, 
and more especially as from the time he learns 
to the time he practises for himself he can 
hardly go for an ordinary walk without seeing 
some operation going on in suburban gardens. 
That gardening is a profession requiring a 
man to acquire a vast store of information, 
and long practice, to become master of it, is 
true enough, and we do not pretend to make 
light of such acquirements, nor do we con- 
template any instruction that would qualify 
ordinary people for any of the higher walks 
of the profession, but we would teach every- 
body enough to enable them to grow their 
own necessary food, in the same way that we 
would teach anybody to read and write with- 
out the least intention to finish a scholastic 
education. "When a man can dig, plant, sow, 
and reap his harvest, or gather his ordinary 
produce, we would leave him to take his 
chance of any further advance, but up t^ that 
we would have the knowledge of gardening 
grounded in him as well as his reading and 
writing, and thus, according to Abercronibie's 
notion, make " every man his own gardener." 

It may be that gardeners will fancy this 
rather an attack upon their interests; quite 
the reverse, however, is the fact. None are 
so well able to appreciate the services of a 
gardener as those who occasionally do the work 
themselves ; if the learner of gardening be- 
come wealthy he makes a better employer, for 
there is no task so irksome as to serve an 
ignorant man. The very best places are those 
in which the owner takes an interest in the 
science, and can judge of a man's labour, and 
perseverance, and capacity. In such places 
you will not find an ignorant head gardener 
taking all the profits, and the working bees

none. It is notorious that many persons who 
hold head places are only reading and not 
■working gardeners, that they have good work- 
ing men under them, who find all the practi- 
cal knowledge, while the head man is in- 
debted to them for the fine condition of the 
establishment and the liberal supply of pro- 
ductions. This could not be if the employer 
was a gardener also, for he would not be long 
in discovering the difference between the man 
who had the credit without the brains, and he 
who had to find the brains without having the 
credit. Therefore would we have a book of 
instruction used at every school, and the 
rising generation well grounded in all that 
could be learned by reading, that each one 
may be able in future times to know when his 
garden is well managed and, if necessary, to 
manage it himself.

AND ORIGINAL NOTES, CONNECTED TYITH HORTICULTURE. 

The Vienna mode of growing Aspa- 
ragus. — A correspondent of the Gardeners' 
Chronicle states the following to be the mode 
in which the huge Vienna Asparagus — said 
to be the best in the world — is grown. The 
"covering of clay" which is mentioned ap- 
pears to be an earthenware hollow cylinder, 
open at one end, and at the other merely pierced 
with a hole to admit light : — The situation of 
the beds should be a sunny one, and dry. 
They should be planted with two rows of 
Asparagus, if three and a half feet broad, and 
in three rows, if five feet broad ; between each 
bed there should be a space of three feet, in 
order that the beds may not be trod upon by 
the gardener when cutting, or cleaning, or 
manuring. The beds should be about three 
to three and a half feet deep, and the earth 
well screened through a sieve. They should 
be thus filled early in April : — 1. One foot 
deep fir-leaves and earth, taken from under 
the trees, or else with wood shavings, rotten 
wood, or other substance which will allow 
the water to drain through. And this is to 
be laid down lightly, not pressed or trodden 
down. 2. Six inches of clean earth passed 
through a sieve. 3. Sis inches of ma- 
nure. 4. Six inches of good earth. 5. Six 
inches of manure. 6. Six inches of fine good 
earth. The Asparagus must then be planted 
at distances of two feet upon hotbeds of three 
inches high, and twelve inches in circum- 
ference, formed in the shape of an inverted 
plate upon the ground, so that the roots may 
spread all around. These roots are then to 
be covered with a little more hotbed earth, 
and the whole bed to be covered with rich 
earth to a good inch above the tops of the 
roots, or a foot above the level of the garden; 
this is necessary, as the beds always sink very 



much for the first year or two. After being 
planted, the beds should be gently watered, 
and as soon as the shoots attain the height of 
six inches they should have a covering of 
clay, with a hole at the top of each, big enough 
to admit of a straw, and the air should be 
allowed to pass through from underneath. 
Asparagus should be planted in April, accord- 
ing to the weather, and will, when thus 
planted, produce for twenty years conse- 
cutively, and increase in quantity every year 
as the roots spread. 

Manure-water for Pot Plants. — Many 
— indeed most — plants grown in pots may, at 
particular periods of the growth, be advan- 
tageously treated with liquid manure ; these 
periods ai*e chiefly during the time of making 
vigorous growth, and of blooming. Inex- 
perienced persons, however, are liable to do 
material injury from using it too strong or too 
often ; or they fall into the other extreme, and 
derive no benefit from the application. A very 
useful liquid manure for pot plants may be 
made by putting the following ingredients into 
a hogshead of rain water : — two pecks of sheep 
or deer dung, one peck of soot, and two quarts 
of Potter's guano ; these ingredients are first 
to be well mixed up to the consistence of paste, 
with boiling water, and then mixed with cold 
water. Stir the mixture frequently for a day 
or two, and then throw in a quart of quick 
lime ; when the liquid has become clear it is 
fit for use. For all strong growing plants this 
may be used daily, or every other day — ap- 
plying it diluted with about one-third of clear 
water. For heaths, and similar delicate-rooted 
plants, and even for orchids, it will prove 
beneficial, but to these should not be given 
oftener than one a week. As before observed, 
it is only to be used — at least by the inex- 
perienced — during the periods of growth and 
blooming. 

Training Climbing Plants. — It is not 
well to interfere too constantly with the grow- 
ing shoots of climbers, nor to restrain them 
too much. Of course, such as would naturally 
grow into an entangled and inseparable mass, 
must be looked to, so far as to prevent this 
from being the case ; but otherwise this class 
of plants enjoy their liberty. Depend on it, 
these scramblers of the jungle do not like too 
much control from the hand of man. This 
must not, however, be carried to the other ex- 
treme, and so end in disorder and confusion, 
but rather try and reconcile the two — liberty 
of growth on the one hand, order and system 
on the other. 

Plant-potting. — Potting is in no other- 
wise different from planting in the open ground 
than that it compels plants to grow in a con- 
fined space. Therefore, whatever conditions 
are favourable or unfavourable to plants in 



384 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



the open ground, are so to plants in pots, 
cceteris paribus. The favourable circum- 
stances are — 1, a loose soil : 2, a rich soil; 
3, a soil well drained. The unfavourable cir- 
cumstances are — 1, a heavy compact soil ; 2, a 
poor soil ; 3, stagnant water. The worst 
mode of potting is that in which finely-sifted 
soil is wholly employed without drainage ; a 
better, but still imperfect mode is, using drain- 
age with a little rough material over it ; the 
perfect mode, as far as we at present know, is 
securing complete drainage, and using the soil 
in a rough state, so as to be permeable by air 
and water. The difficulties — for there are 
difficuties — connected with potting are, — 

1, rapid drying, the roots from their tendency 
to extend outwards being mostly on the out- 
side of the ball at the sides of the pots, and 
thus exposed to heat and currents of air; 

2, exhaustion of the soil from repeated water- 
ing, washing out its nutritive particles, a cir- 
cumstance which takes place exactly in propor- 
tion as the plants are well or ill potted. The 
modes of meeting these difficulties are — 1, in 
regard to drying, to double-pot, as has been 
sometimes done, to plunge the pots, to keep 
the plants in the shade, and to employ pots 
made of hard material, as slate for instance, 
which does not allow evaporation to go on so 
rapidly as porous earthenware pots ; 2, ex- 
haustion of the soil may be prevented by top- 
dressing, and keeping the soil in a condition 
so as only to need a little w r ater at a time. 
The best cultivators, indeed, prefer syringing 
over-head when practicable ; the water that 
trickles off the branches and leaves being 
sufficient to keep the soil moist. 

Pelargonium Lucia Rosea. — This va- 
riety is in its habit and appearance much like 
one of the class called "scarlet" pelargoniums. 
It is a very compact growing plant, with short- 
jointed stems, and good sized leaves, of a soft 
velvety character. The flower-stems are strong, 
and grow erect, so that the trusses of bloom 
are brought well above the foliage ; the colour 
of the flowers is a most delicate soft pink, or 
peach blossom, w T ith a lovely white eye — alto- 
gether a distinct colour among pelargoniums. 
It is a gem for the flower garden, being not 
only perfectly distinct, but also superlatively 
beautiful. Sometimes, when kept in pots, and 
not very freely grown, we have observed it to 
produce but small trusses of bloom, but this 
improves when it is growing freely in the open 
garden. Probably, however, it may in time be 
improved on ; in the mean time it may chiefly 
be valued for its novel colour. 

OENOTHERA MISSOURIENSIS. — This plant 

forms an excellent May flower for beds ; it 
grows with short stems, which recline on the 
ground, and produce lance-shaped leaves, and 
large yellow poppy-like flowers. The readiest 



mode of propagating it may not be generally 
known. Three strong old plants taken up and 
introduced to bottom heat in the month of 
March, will produce plants enough for a very 
large mass. They must be struck precisely as 
Dahlias ; one plant will yield thirty or forty 
sprouts, and they will strike within a fort- 
night. 

Eight Conservatory Climbers. — 1 . Com- 
bretum purpureum., or, as it is now called, 
Poiorea coccinea, a half shrubby plant, with 
oval leaves, and branching spikes of scarlet 
flowers, with conspicuous stamens ; it will 
flower all the summer by stopping the strongest 
shoots occasionally, 2. Echites suberecta, a 
beautiful yellow flowering plant, which has 
generally been grown in the stove, but will 
answer well for the conservatory by spur- 
pruning, like the vine ; it is a very strong 
grower. 3. Ipomoea Horsfallice, a splendid 
plant, with deeply lobed leaves, and bunches 
of crimson blossoms ; should have a warm 
close position. 4. Mandevilla suaveolens, 
a very free grower, with hairy oval leaves, 
and bunches of white deliciously fragrant 
flowers. 5. Passiflora racemosa, a splendid 
crimson passion-flower, which will flower 
freely nearly the whole year ; does best 
grafted upon one of the hardier sorts. 6. Plum- 
bago capensis, an easily grown plant, with long 
slender stems, bluntish leaves, and good sized 
bunches of pale blue flowers ; may be had in 
bloom from April to November, by cutting 
back some of the strongest shoots in summer. 
7. Stephanotis Jloribunda, a beautiful ever- 
green plant, with dark green shining blunt oval 
leaves, and bunches of white deliciously scented 
blossoms ; it is a splendid thing when planted 
out in a conservatory border, and grows very 
fast. 8. Tecoma jasminoides, a very free 
flowerer upon the young wood from July to the 
end of October ; it has much divided leaves, 
and bunches of white flowers, with a crimson 
centre. 

Fences for Plantations. — It is well 
known that thorn or other live hedges do not 
thrive well on the shady side of plantations, 
and more cumbrous fences, such as dry stone 
dykes, are expensive and unsightly. In such 
cases wire fencing may be employed. The 
timber used as standards for the wires will 
cost but little, and may be generally got out 
of the plantation, if an established one. The 
wires, staples, and fitting up, cost about \0d. 
per yard. Such a fence is light and neat, 
and a great saving of land is effected, as the 
wires can be placed close to the trees, while 
hedges must be planted far enough from 
them to be free from the drip of their 
boughs. Besides this, much shelter is secured 
in winter and shade in summer for cattle, 
sheep, &c. 



THE THUNBERGIA. 



385 




THE THUNBERGIA. 

Apart from any inherent elegance of habit, 
and altogether irrespective of intrinsic beauty, 
the "climbers" are a class of plants which 
meet with universal favour. This is, per- 
haps, owing to a certain adaptability which 
they possess, and in consequence of which 
they may always be invested with a certain 
degree of appropriateness wherever intro- 
duced. Thunbergias are of this character. 

Most people who are at all acquainted with 
flowers know something of Thunbergias, one 
or two of the species and some of their varie- 
ties being rather commonly grown. They all 
possess a certain degree of resemblance, which 
is apparent in their climbing habit, their 
more or less heart-shaped leaves variously 
angled on the margins, and in the form of 
their blossoms. As moderate-sized climbers 
for pot-culture, they may be grown with very 
good effect ; they may also be planted as per- 
manent creepers in greenhouses and conser- 
vatories ; and some of the kinds flourish in 
favourable situations out of doors in summer. 

The genus is not a very extensive one. 
About nine species are, we believe, cultivated 
in gardens, and of these some varieties have 
been produced. The name is given in honour 
of Thunberg, a celebrated botanist and tra- 
veller, and the author of some botanical 
works. The Thunbergias belong to the na- 
tural group Acanthaceas ; and the Linnsean 
Didynamia Angiospermia. Some of the spe- 
cies are, according to the most modern nomen- 
clature, distinguished by other generic names, 
which we shall indicate as we come to them ; 
our purpose, however, will be best served by 
48. 



retaining the older and better known title. 
The following kinds are in cultivation : — 

Thuribergia alata, Bojer (wing petioled 
Thunbergia). — A slender climbing perennial 
plant, growing about four or five feet in 
height under favourable circumstances, clothed 
with soft cordate- sagittate opposite leaves, 
sometimes toothed, and sometimes nearly void 
of toothing, and bearing from the axils a 
profusion of buff-coloured blossoms with a 
rich black centre ; the flowers consist of a 
tube, which is dilated at top, and a spreading 
limb of two inches diameter, divided into five 
nearly equal rounded segments. It is a native 
of the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, on the 
eastern coast of Africa, and was introduced in 
1823. It blooms from May to October. There 
are several very distinct varieties : — albiflora 
has the flowers pure white, with the dark 
centre ; aurantiaca has deep orange- buff 
flowers, dark in the centre ; Fryerii has the 
flowers orange-buff coloured, with a whitish 
centre, and is besides large, and very round 
and well defined in its outline. These three 
are the handsomest, and the best of all for 
common purposes. Besides these there are 
the following, which are probably varieties of 
alata : — Hakerii with pure white flowers ; and 
lutea with pale buff-coloured flowers, whitish 
in the centre. 

Thmibergia angulata, Bojer (angulated 
Thunbergia). — A slender climbing perennial 
plant, growing about four feet high, with cor- 
dately-triangular, and, in some cases, acutely 
arrow-shaped opposite leaves, and producing 
small pale purplish flowers, with a greenish 
tube ; they proceed from the axils. It is not 
a very showy plant. A native of Madagascar, 
and introduced in 1821. It flowers from May 
to September. 

Thunbergia ra/)e??s«r,Linna5us (Cape of Good 
Hope Thunbergia). — A small slender climbing 
perennial plant, with soft heart-shaped, slightly 
toothed opposite leaves, and clear yellow 
flowers, which are represented to grow ou 
very long footstalks from the axils of the 
leaves. It is a native of the Cape of Good 
Hope, and was introduced in 1824. It flowers 
freely during the summer.

THE THUNBERGIA. 



Thwibergia chrysops, Hooker (golden-eyed 
Thunbergia). — A stout growing climbing 
plant, of a compact and half shrubby sort of 
habit, producing opposite heart-shaped leaves, 
with small angular teeth on the margins, and 
bearing its flowers from the axils ; the flowers 
are large and beautifully coloured, the golden 
eye is surrounded by a belt of light blue, the 
five broad outer segments being of a rich dark 
purple. The habit of this plant is, to a cer- 
tain extent, suffruticose, and young plants, if 
kept stopped back, may be made almost to 
assume the shrub-like character, if they are 
not grown too strong ; older plants, in a free 
state of growth, assume the climbing character. 
A native of Sierra Leone, and introduced -in 
1843. Flowers through the summer months. 

Thunbergia coccinea, Wallich (scarlet- 
flowered Thunbergia). — A free growing climb- 
ing perennial plant, growing six or eight feet 
high, with cordate shining opposite leaves, 
angular at the base, and having a long point ; 
the flowers grow in drooping racemes from 
the axils of the leaves, and are of a light 
scarlet colour, but the petals reflex, as in the 
blossoms oflfimulus cardinalis, which detracts 
much from their effect. It is a native of 
Nepal, and was introduced in 1823. It flowers 
freely towards the autumn. This plant is now 
sometimes called Hexacentris coccinea (Nees). 

Thunbergia cordata, Colla (heart-leaved 
Thunbergia). — A small climbing plant, growing 
about three feet high, with heart-shaped leaves, 
and bearing white blossoms during the latter 
part of spring and the summer. It is a native 
of Brazil, and was introduced about 1820. 

Thunbergia fragrans, Roxburgh (fragrant 
Thunbergia). — A slender climbing plant, with 
somewhat rigid stems, growing three or four 
feet in length, furnished with opposite cordate- 
acuminate dentated leaves, from whose axils 
are produced the pure white blossoms. It is 
a native of the East Indies, and was introduced 
in 1796. Its flowering season is the summer 
months, but it is almost perpetually in blossom. 

Thunbergia grandiflora, Roxburgh (large 
flowered Thunbergia). — A robust climbing 
plant, with branches attaining ten or twelve 
feet in length, producing opposite angularly cor- 
date leaves, from whose axils are borne the large 
deep blue flowers, which remain in perfection 
several days. It is a native of the East Indies, 
and was introduced about 1820. It flowers 
during great part of the summer season. 

Thunbergia Hawtayneana, Wallich (Haw- 
tayne's Thunbergia). — A vigorous climbing 
plant, growing ten or twelve feet or more in 
length, furnished with entire heart-shaped 
leathery leaves, having from their axils large 
blue flowers with a yellow throat. It requires 
to be well established before it produces many 
blossoms. It is a native of Nepal, and was 



introduced about 1826. It flowers throughout 
the summer. This species is called Meyenia 
Hawtayneana (Nees). 

The numerous varieties of Thunbergia 
alata are the most suited for general cultiva- 
tion, and they are, perhaps, the most beautiful 
of all. They grow well in pots ; and along 
with balsams and various tender annuals and 
free flowering stove plants they form excel- 
lent greenhouse ornaments during summer. 
For this purpose, as indeed for most others, 
they are best raised from seeds, although they 
may be perpetuated by cuttings ; seedlings, 
however, make much more vigorous plants. 
The seeds should be sown in February in pots 
of any light soil, and placed in a hotbed frame, 
along with the various tender annuals raised 
at that season of the year. As soon as they 
are fairly vegetated, plant them singly into 
small pots in a rough soil, composed of two 
parts of turfy heath soil, one part of sandy 
loam, and one of well decayed leaf mould. 
This soil will be suitable for them throughout 
the different periods of growth. Keep them 
growing in a hotbed where the warmth is 
slight, and where a good portion of fresh air 
can be admitted. They are best kept in a 
frame in this way until the greenhouse is 
cleared out in May or June, when they should 
be taken there along with various other plants 
to decorate that structure during summer. If 
no frame can be spared, remove them to a 
warm shelf in the greenhouse earlier. Keep 
them repotted frequently, so that ultimately, 
by the beginning of June, they may be in 
twelve-inch or even eighteen-inch pots. They 
must be well watered, and every third water- 
ing may consist of clear diluted liquid manure, 
made either with the drainings of the dunghill 
or with sheep or deer dung, or with guano or 
Potter's guano. A very excellent liquid 
manure for these and other plants may be 
made as follows : — Take two pecks of sheep's 
dung, one peck of soot, and two quarts of 
Potter's guano : mix these first into a paste 
with boiling water, and then add a hogshead 
of rain-water. Stir frequently for a day or 
two, and then stir in a quart of quick lime, 
and as soon as the water is quite clear, it is fit 
for use. This water, diluted with about one- 
third clear water, may be used for plants of all 
kinds — even orchids will not object to it, and 
heaths and most hard-wooded plants revel in 
it ; once a week will be frequent enough to 
use it, except to very strong rooted things, 
many of which would enjoy it daily. 

The plants require a trellis for their 
branches, and, if they grow freely, they will 
cover a considerable space. The following is 
a good mode of trellising these plants. Around 
the inside of the pot, after the final shifting 
(the largest size mentioned), place five or six 



THE THUNBERGIA.

slender green states four and a half feet long; 
set them so that at the top they may be some- 
what wider apart than at the base ; in the 
centre place one five feet long : at the top 
place cross bars fastened to the tops of the 
other uprights : around the stakes run a slen- 
der wire spirally from bottom to top, at about 
six or eight inches apart, giving the wire a 
turn round each of the stakes at intervals, to 
keep them steady. To each of the uprights 
train a leading shoot, for which purpose the 
plants must have been stopped, and when 
these have reached half way up the trellis, 
stop them, to cause them to throw out lateral 
shoots, one of which is to be continued as a 
leader, and the rest trained round the trellis : 
when the upright shoots reach the top of the 
trellis, stop them again to produce laterals to 
fill the upper half. 

Seed should be procured for another year 
if possible ; but sometimes this is not very 
freely produced, so that, to secure it, some of 
the blooms should be impregnated, and one or 
two set out of doors when in full bloom in fine 
weather, and fully exposed to the sun, and 
then, after the seeds have made some progress, 
removed back again to the greenhouse to ripen. 
In case of a failure in obtaining seed, a few 
cuttings should be planted about August, and 
set in a cutting-frame ; they should be potted 
into small pots in rather sandy peat soil, and 
kept during winter in a cool stove, or on a 
very warm shelf in a greenhouse. 

For flowering in the open garden, the 
plants are best raised from seeds at the end of 
the previous summer, and kept over winter in 
a cool part of the stove ; then shifted in 
spring and hardened off, so as to be ready to 
plant out in May. Much of their beauty 
depends on securing deep green foliage, and 
this may be secured by using liquid manure, 
or manuring plentifully with decomposed cow 
dung. They require a warm sheltered place. 

For planting out in conservatories the plants 
may be prepared as for the open air ; and after 
planting out, the chief attention required con- 
sists in attending to the training of the branches. 

Thunbergia Haivtayneana and Thunbergia 
grandijiora are adapted for planting out in 
conservatories, or for growing in large pots, 
the branches being trained up to the pillars 
and rafters ; they both of them flourish best in 
a temperature intermediate between a stove 
and a greenhouse, such as is usually main- 
tained in conservatories. If they are at- 
tempted to be grown on pot-trellises, the 
latter must be of considerable size. In winter 
they should be kept cool and comparatively 
dry, and about the beginning of March should 
be repotted, and pruned, and set growing in 
a genial temperature. A rough soil of equal 
parts peat, loam, and leaf mould will suit them, 



and they ought to be shifted often for a time 
until they are placed in their blooming-pots, 
which should be rather early, so that by their 
filling these with roots, and thus sustaining a 
sort of check, they may be thrown into bloom 
early in the summer. In pruning, thin out 
the branches well, leaving the best ripened, 
and moderately shortening them. They must 
have plenty of light, and an airy place where 
there is no draught. They propagate readily 
by cuttings. 

Thunbergia coccinea may be managed simi- 
larly with the above, or it may be grown in 
pots and trained on a pot-trellis, in which case 
one of considerable size is required. It re- 
quires a stove ; and should be kept cool and 
rather dry in winter, and well cut back, re- 
potted, and set to grow afresh in spring. Like 
the others, it should be got early into its 
blooming-pots, and kept in a light though less 
airy situation. 

Thunbergia fragrans should be grown in a 
stove during the spring, and then, as its 
growth becomes matured, removed to a warm 
greenhouse , where it will flower freely if a 
warm moist atmosphere is maintained. To 
the soil recommended for the others add an 
eighth part of silver sand for this, and repot 
and prune the plants about the beginning of 
March, having kept them in rested condition 
during the winter. This does not require a 
very large trellis, nor so large pots as the 
stronger growers. 

Thunbergia capensis, Thunbergia cordata, 
and Thunbergia angidata may be treated 
similarly, except that the former does not 
need quite so much heat, and the latter can 
scarcely be kept too warm. They are all pro- 
pagated by cuttings. 

Thunbergia chrysops is a free growing plant, 
for which the mixture of peat, loam, and leaf 
mould will be suitable. It requires stove- 
heat in the spring, and may subsequently be 
removed to a warm greenhouse to flower dur- 
ing the summer. The plants must be kept in 
rather small pots to induce a free flowering 
habit, and for the same reason ought not to 
be fresh potted when the season is much ad- 
vanced. If the plants are shifted about the 
end of April, and the pots become filled with 
roots, the plants may then be expected to 
bloom with freedom during the months of 
summer. In young plants much of the climbing 
habit may be checked by continued stopping 
and cool regimen, so as to give them a semi- 
shrub-like character, which they will retain 
by a continuation of the same kind of treatment, 
if they are not in other respects grown too 
vigorously. It propagates readily from cuttings. 

Those plants that are grown in pots are 
benefited by having a slight degree of bottom 
heat during the earlier stages of their progress;

ROUTINE OF COTTAGE GARDENING. 



and it should also be a rule to keep the 
branches — except perhaps the leading ones, 
where any particular plan of training is 
adopted — frequently stopped ; this would tend 
to check over luxuriance, and favour the pro- 
duction of flowers. Though comparative rest 
and drought has been recommended as a 
general feature of winter management, yet 
there are exceptions to this rule ; thus, for 
instance, when it is desired to change the 
period for blooming, the period of growth 
may be varied accordingly, and when very 
early flowers are desired, the plants must be 
in an active state during winter ; this most 
of the species readily submit to. And even 
where the winter is, as is natural, appropriated 
as a resting period, the evergreen nature of 
the plants must be borne in mind, and mois- 
ture must not be so far withheld as to cause 
them to shed their foliage ; a moderate state 
of dryness is what is required. In the more 
active growing period, when the branches 
require training, it is found that training 



downwards or backwards is beneficial in 
promoting a flowering condition : this simple 
point is worth bearing in mind. 

The leaves of all the species are exceedingly 
liable to suffer from the attacks of a minute 
insect, called by gardeners the red spider, a 
species of acarus or mite (Acarus Telarius). 
When the plants are subjected to a dry 
atmosphere the leaves soon become infested 
with these insects, which spread 'rapidly, and 
do material injury by eating the under side, 
which causes them to become spotted and 
sickly-looking, to the disfigurement of the 
plants, whose beauty is much enhanced by 
the deep green of their foliage when in a vigor- 
ous state. The best remedy for these is to 
prevent them ; and they will not make their ap- 
pearance nor establish themselves if a moist 
atmosphere is maintained, and the plants are 
kept well syringed : to remove them, syring- 
ing with water mixed with sulphur vivum, and 
dusting the under side of the leaves with this 
when they are damp, should be resorted to. 



ROUTINE OF COTTAGE GARDENING, 



BY JAMES GRIGOR. 



The first grand requisite is for every man 
to have a liquid manure tank fixed at a con- 
venient distance from his dwelling. It is by 
no means necessary to go to the expense of 
brickwork and cement, an excellent substitute 
being found in pipes, hogsheads, beer-barrels, 
tubs, &c, according to the number of a man's 
family. Those tanks should be sunk into the 
soil, the hole in which they are set being well 
lined with soft clay, afterwards pressed tightly 
down about the sides. It is not necessary that 
a man should have a piggery or a cow-house 
in order to fill such tanks, for it has been found 
that the liquid collected in bed-rooms, &c, is 
preferable to any other. 

"Well, thus provided, we shall suppose the 
labouring man to start with an allotment at 
Michaelmas. If he kept a cow, the first thing 
he would do would be to dig a portion of the 
land for rye, or rye and vetches together, for 
of all things this is the most useful crop as 
spring feed. The vetches would be succeeded 
by turnips sown during the latter part of 
May. If potatoes had just been removed 
from the land, the first thing to be done is to 
spread upon it well-rotted manure, and if the 
land is loose and dry, a coating of marl and 
clay is found to answer well in hardening it 
so as to cause it to bear up the straw. Wheat 
dislikes fresh manure, and if the land could 
be enriched sufficiently at the time of laying 
down the previous crop, it would be better 
not to give it any. If part of the land should 
be clover ley, it should in like manner be dug 
up for wheat, carefully freeing it from all 



noxious weeds. The best manure for this 
sort of crop is mould well saturated with 
liquid. The wheat should be either drilled 
with a hoe or dibbled at the rate of six inches 
every way from each seed. A peck of seed 
will plant an acre ; and it will be found to 
tiller so that it will completely cover the 
soil and produce large and heavy ears. 

During the month of October, early York 
cabbages should be planted, to be succeeded 
by kidney beans sown in June ; and if the 
lines of cabbages are not very close to each 
other, the beans may be inserted during April 
and May whilst yet the cabbages are on the 
ground. In the latter case, liquid manure 
should be applied to the beans during moist 
weather ; and in a fortnight afterwards they 
will assume a healthy green colour. Another 
plan is to plant early Yorks so that each 
plant may occupy about a square yard, thus 
leaving a sufficient space for intruding as 
many rows of Scotch cabbages during May as 
there are, at present, rows of the former. By 
the time the Yorks come to maturity and are 
removed, the others have plenty of space left 
for their future growth. 

The cottager's work for November con- 
sists chiefly in pulling up and storing car- 
rots, mangold-wurtzel, collecting and turning 
over manure heaps, planting cabbages and 
wheat, (if not done in the previous month,) 
spreading liquid manure over lucerne and 
digging between the drills, planting a few 
turnips for seed, turning up soil for the 
winter to operate upon, &c, sowing peas, 



ROUTINE OF COTTAGE GARDENING.

and if a warm sheltered spot can be had, a 
few radishes. 

December is reckoned the dead month of 
the year. A great deal may be done, how- 
ever, by cottagers during their spare hours in 
collecting leaves, mould, &c, along the sides 
of hedges. It is impossible for a cottager to 
have too much manure when spring comes, 
and he should ever remember that the collect- 
ing of it about his neighbourhood produces a 
neat and tidy appearance. Roads and fences 
should be now repaired ; and if any part of 
the land should require trenching or draining, 
now is the time. Gooseberry bushes should 
be all pruned during this month. If any stubble 
is left, let it be dug up for potatoes planted 
about six inches deep. 

Let January be commenced by trenching 
up stubble ground on which plenty of liquid 
manure has been thrown, for carrots. This 
crop dislikes fresh solid manure, but the 
liquid, if put on now, it likes. The ground 
should be left rough, so that the atmosphere 
may operate effectually upon it. When the 
time comes for sowing, which is the end of 
March, it should be prepared afresh. During 
this month you will have an opportunity of 
meeting with a few well-formed savoys : take 
them and plant them by themselves for seed, 
for a good breed requires no greater attention 
than a bundle of loose leaves. In like man- 
ner, a few carrots and Swedes should be 
selected for seed. Potatoes should now be 
planted during open weather, also early frame 
peas, which should be steeped in a decoction 
of bitter aloes to prevent the mice eating 
them. If in a warm situation, a line of 
radishes may be put in between the rows of 
peas, and removed before the latter interferes 
with them. 

February. — In reference to many crops 
Nature, during this month, makes the last 
call upon cottagers : — now, or not till next 
season. If hedging and ditching has to be 
done, it must be proceeded with immediately. 
If a fence has to be planted, not an hour 
should be lost, for the whitethorn is already 
on the start and will soon be green with 
swelling buds. On all patches of grass, lu- 
cerne and vetches, the liquid manure should 
now be applied, and especially on such spots 
as want mending. Wheat, too, if found back- 
ward, or thin in parts, should have some of 
the liquid applied to it. If your early cab- 
bages are to be in the market ten days earlier 
than those of your neighbour, steal a march 
upon him by applying the contents of the 
tank, poured into circular basins formed 
around the root of each plant. In fact, the 
work of no month in the year affects the day 
of reckoning so much as the present. It is 
now that the heavy sheaves are to be formed. 



The spade should be in continual exercise, 
digging two spits deep, for a carrot crop to be 
sown the end of next month, and for a present 
sowing of beans and planting of cabbages. 
Now level down the well-trenched ground for 
a main crop of onions, which may be sown 
during the last week of the month. At the 
same time sow parsnips in rows eighteen 
inches apart. 

March opens with carrying plenty of liquid 
manure to the ground intended for carrots pre- 
vious to its being turned over afresh for the 
seed; and in like manner for mangold-wurtzel. 
Sow both from the 20th till the end of the 
month. Let a full crop of potatoes be now 
planted, and between each set insert a table 
bean which rises high and interferes not with 
the haulm of the former. If there is a warm 
vacant spot under a fence, insert a few kidney 
beans, but reserve the main sowings till April 
and May. A full crop of onions should now 
be sown in rich, deep, free soil which has 
been well manured and ridged up in Decem- 
ber. They should be sown in rows a foot 
apart, covering the seeds about three quarters 
of an inch deep. They will succeed all the 
better if the soil is trampled with the feet, or 
pressed down with the back of a rake. Early 
turnips may also be sown now, but the soil 
should be fine and rich. 

In April potatoes have to be planted, carrots 
sown, and a crop of barley laid down on part 
of the turnip ground. Early cabbages should 
now be carefully earthed up, leaving a ridge 
on each side of the lines, so as to hold the 
liquid manure, which should be again applied 
during this month. Choose the evening or 
cloudy moist weather for this operation. If 
not formerly done, stubble land should now be 
turned over for turnips. Mangold-wurtzel 
will succeed well enough still : the seeds 
should be inserted in rows two feet apart, the 
plants rising in lines at about a foot apart. 

May. — The rye which was recommended to 
be sown at Michaelmas should now be suc- 
ceeded by turnips or potatoes. In either case 
solid manure and the contents of the tank 
should be applied liberally, and the soil dug 
twice over. All growing crops, including 
wheat, should have the soil loosened about 
them during this month, by frequent hoeings. 
Sow a full crop of French beans in lines four 
feet apart, planting cabbages between. It is 
also a good plan to sow turnips between the 
lines of carrots. 

In June see that all your potato crops are 
clean. If any should have failed, raise a neigh- 
bouring set carefully with the spade, and 
take all the shoots away except one, which 
leave where it was taken from. The others 
carefully divide and plant in your open spaces, 
covering up the plant so as to leave only a few 



390 



THE POPLARS. 



inches above ground. They will soon strike 
root, and produce large tubers, if encouraged 
with diluted liquid from the tank. Between 
your lines of early ash-leaved, insert a full 
crop of savoys, and take care whilst removing 
the potatoes during next month that you do 
not turn up the roots of the former. Winter 
cabbages, such as the drumhead, may be 
planted in like manner. Any deficiency in the 
richness of the soil will have to be made up by 
applications of liquid from the tank. 

In July a full crop of winter cabbages 
should be put in, watering them well, and in 
moist weather applying liquid to them after 
they have rooted. Remove the bloom from 



the potatoes during this month. If a cow is 
kept, let the cottager now sow white turnips 
at the commencement of the month, if not 
done during the last few weeks. Onions will 
be fit for removing towards the end of this 
month : in their place plant winter cabbages. 
Let the hoe be used continually amongst tur- 
nips, mangold-wurtzel, carrots, &c. 

August is the great reaping month. After 
removing the potatoes during the first week, 
let a full crop of brocoli succeed them. Sow 
during this month a yard or so of early York 
cabbage seed, and transplant them in October 
and November. Let the liquid manure tanks be 
now emptied on the stubble intended for rye. 




Populus tremnla. 



THE POPLARS. 



Among the variety of timber trees which 
have been brought under cultivation, the pop- 
lars are pre-eminently distinguished for their 
rapidity of growth. They thus become largely 
employed in new plantations, for the purpose 
of producing what is called immediate effect, 
that is to say, of giving apparent age to the 
plantations, and securing early the conditions of 
shade and shelter, which trees of considerable 
size alone can supply. The more valuable 
kinds of timber take a much longer period to 
attain this size, and hence the value of rapid 
growing kinds to supply their place tempora- 
rily. In plantations intended for ornament 
or effect onty, these temporary trees should be 
so placed, that they may be gradually removed 
as the better kinds of trees gain size ; and so, 
also, that their removal may not mar the 



scenic effect of the masses. Where temporary 
trees of this kind are introduced into planta- 
tions intended for profit, their removal will of 
course be made dependent on the plan or 
arrangement upon which they were intro- 
duced ; and this plan should be clear and well 
defined at the time of making the plantation, 
so that whilst the temporary trees are suffered 
to remain long enough to realize the greatest 
possible return, this will not involve their re- 
maining so long as to injure the more valuable 
and permanent crop of timber. Very much 
of injury and loss is, and ever has been, sus- 
tained from the neglect of this principle, which 
is based upon common sense, and should be 
self-evident. To so great an extent has this 
been the case, that the injury has come to be 
often laid to the charge of these temporary 



THE POPLARS. 



391 



trees, which is manifestly unfair. The various 
kinds of poplar have come in for their share 
of calumny, and in many quarters a vast deal 
of prejudice exists against them : they have, 
however, their use, and this is what it is our 
purpose now briefly to set forth. 

The principal kinds of poplar cultivated in 
this country are the following, which we shall 
briefly notice separately ; the Abele, the 
Aspen, the common black Poplar, the black 
Italian Poplar, the Lombardy Poplar, the 
Tacamahac, or balsam Poplar, and the Ontario 
Poplar. Besides these there are several 
others, some of which are not uncommon. 

The Abele, or white poplar (Populus alba), 
is a large growing tree, of which several va- 
rieties are in cultivation : it attains as much 
as ninety feet in height. It is by some said 
to be the same tree as that mentioned in the 
Bible under the name of shittim-wood. The 
roots of this kind throw up numerous suckers ; 
the branches are white, and densely downy 
when young ; the leaves are deeply lobed, and 
toothed on the margin ; and the buds are with- 
out gum. The grey, or common white pop- 
lar, (JP. canescens), closely resembles this in 
general properties. The wood of both kinds 
is very white and light, and is much used for 
flooring, but for this purpose requires to be 
well seasoned ; it is also used for making 
packing-cases, as it does not crack when nails 
are driven into it ; wherever lightness either 
of weight or colour is required, it is especi- 
ally suitable. The trees do not bear lopping, 
owing to the softness of the wood, and its 
liability to shrink or crack ; even when mo- 
derate sized branches are cut off, the wound 
should be covered with clay. It is one of the 
species well suited for filling up and thick- 
ening plantations, and for this purpose trun- 
cheons of ten or twelve feet long and four or 
five inches in diameter may be planted. 

The Aspen, or trembling leaved poplar (P. 
tremula), of which an engraving stands at 
the head of this article, is a very ornamental 
object. It forms a large tree, but seldom more 
than from fifty to seventy feet high. Its roots, 
however, much impoverish the soil, and its 
leaves are detrimental to pastures. Its growth 
is rapid, and the branches extend horizontally, 
and at length become more or less pendulous. 
A variety called pendula has a very beautiful 
drooping habit. The leaves are roundish 
ovate, and toothed on the margin. This tree 
does not bear lopping well. The wood is 
white and tender, and is employed by turners, 
coopers, sculptors, joiners, and cabinet makers, 
and for various minor uses. 

The common black poplar (P. nigra) is a 
very rapid growing tree, attaining to the height 
of thirty or forty feet in ten years, and ar- 
riving at its perfection in from forty to fifty 



years, beginning to decay when from sixty to- 
eighty years old. The leaves are deltoid, 
pointed, and saw-edged. The tree bears lop- 
ping, and treated as a pollard produces an 
abundance of shoots ; when cut down to the 
ground annually, it throws up numerous shoots 
like the willows. The wood is soft and yellow, 
and more liable to split than that of either 
the Abele, or the Aspen ; it is, however, a 
good deal used for packing cases, and in Ber- 
lin the wood produced by knotty trunks, which 
is curiously mottled, is much used in making 
ladies' workboxes. 

The black Italian, or 'necklace-bearing 
poplar (P. monilifera), is the most rapid 
growing of all the species. It will grow to a 
height of thirty or forty feet in seven years, 
and ultimately attains a height of from a 
hundred to a hundred and twenty feet. The 
leaves are deltoid, with a sharp point, almost 
cordate at the base in some cases. The wood 
of this tree is equal in quality, if not superior 
to that of the other poplars, and from its ex- 
ceedingly rapid growth, a very large quantity 
is produced. Its large size renders it more 
fitted for building purposes. When employed 
temporarily to fill up plantations, or for im- 
mediate effect, proper attention should be- 
given to thinning the trees, and to removing 
them before they injure others ; otherwise 
they very soon overpower them. The stem 
is straight, and by judicious early pruning 
may be kept clear of branches to any height. 

The Lombardy, or fastigiate poplar (P. 
fastigiata), is of a totally distinct habit from the 
rest of its family, and indeed almost every 
other tree ; both stem and branches assume 
and retain a perfectly erect position, and reach 
a great height with a very inconsiderable 
diameter ; this habit is termed fastigiate. The 
growth of this tree, in favourable soil, is very 
rapid ; an instance is recorded where one hun- 
dred and twenty-five feet was attained in fifty 
years. The ultimate height varies according 
to circumstances from a hundred to a hundred 
and fifty. The trunk is twisted, and very 
deeply furrowed, and the wood, which is small 
in quantity in proportion to the height of the 
tree, is of little worth or duration. The leaves 
are deltoid, and much acuminated, crenulated 
along the whole margin. From its peculiar 
habit it is a very useful tree in landscape com- 
position. 

The Tacamahac, or balsam-bearing poplar 
(P. lalsamifer-a), and the Ontario poplar (P. 
candicans), have a close general resemblance 
to each other. They are of very sturdy and 
somewhat upright habit, and attain, the former 
from forty to fifty, and the latter from fifty to 
sixty feet in height, growing rapidly while 
young. They both delight in rich soil, near 
water, and under these circumstances grow

with great vigour. In both, the buds of the 
shoots are covered with a profusion of a very- 
fragrant gummy matter. The balsam poplar has 
ovate-acuminate, or oval-lanceolate leaves ; the 
Ontario has them heart-shaped and sharply 
pointed ; in both cases they are saw-edged. 
The balsam poplar is one of the first trees to 
break forth into leaf in the spring, and in 
moist evenings, these and the gummy buds 
are so fragrant as to perfume the surrounding 
air ; those of the other kind are a fortnight 
later. They are chiefly planted as ornamen- 
tal objects. 

We must not omit to mention one peculiar 
situation in which some of the poplars grow 
with tolerable freedom, while few other trees 
will survive. We refer to the smoky atmo- 
sphere of large towns, and especially in popu- 
lated places. In such situations trees are doubt- 
less of much importance in a sanitary point of 
view ; their roots absorb from the soil, and 
derive nourishment from, those very matters 
which pollute the air, and after having served 
the economy of the plant, a portion is again 
returned to the atmosphere in the form of 
pure vital air. For this reason, trees should 
be introduced wherever practicable in densely 
populated districts ; and although alone they 
may not be powerful enough to effect a com- 
plete sanitary reformation, yet, as aids in the 
great social work, they ought not to be over- 
looked. The black Italian, the common black, 
and the Lombardy, are perhaps the best to 
select with this object in view. All the 
species are moreover valuable as screens to 
hide unsightly buildings, or other objects that 
cannot be removed.

The following varieties were the very best 
of a large collection very finely bloomed in 
pots. They were noted down as the most

EXOGONIUM PURGA.

The above were those which succeeded best 
under the circumstances in the case alluded 
to. Some slight allowance should probably 
be made for the relative strength and vigour 
of the bulbs, which would in some degree in- 
fluence their success ; but as there were in 
most cases as many as four bulbs of each 
kind planted, and in many cases more than 
this number, the result may be regarded as a 
pretty good index of what may be expected 



from the same varieties in other instances. It 
may be well to remark, that when Hyacinths 
are planted out-doors, it is better to plant a 
large number of one kind than to intermix 
them. The remarks, early, medium season, 
and late, are intended simply to indicate the 
relative conditions of their blooming period ; 
those marked early being first in bloom, and 
being also in perfection at the same time; and 
the same with the later varieties. 




EXOGONIUM PUEGA. 
(Bentliam.) 
THE PURGA, OR TRUE JALAP. 



The drug sold under the name of jalap is 
the tuberous roots of a convolvulaceous plant, 
the true jalap being that of Exogonium 
(or Ipomcea) JPurga, but the roots of other 
species are at times substituted for those of 
the true kind. Jalap was at one time sup- 
posed to be the produce of Ipomcea macro- 
rhiza (the Convolvulus Jalapa of Linnasus), 
which produces large roots weighing from 
forty to fifty pounds each ; but the root of this 
species has been ascertained to consist chiefly 
of saccharine and farinaceous matter, and to 
possess no purgative properties. A kind of 
jalap called Purga Macho, Jalapa Macho, or 
Male Jalap, by the Mexicans, is produced by 
a plant called Ipomcea orizabensis ; this is ex- 
tremely similar in quality to the true jalap. 
Although jalap has been used in European 
medicine for nearly two centuries and a half, 
yet it is only within a few years that the plant 
which furnishes it has been accurately ascer- 
tained. 

Exogonium Purga is a very beautiful 
climbing plant. It has roundish tubers, which 
sometimes become as large as a moderate sized 
turnip, and produce numerous stems, which 



are glabrous, turning from right to left, and 
extending ten or twelve feet. The leaves are 
alternate, acutely heart-shaped, or somewhat 
arrow-shaped, with a rounded, deeply lobed 
base, smooth, and of very moderate size. The 
flower stalks grow from the axils, and usually 
bear each two or three flowers (very rarely 
one) ; they are between funnel and salver 
shaped, shiny, and of a light purplish red, or 
rosy lilac colour ; the tube is slender and club 
shaped, about two inches long, slightly taper- 
ing, and terminating in a nearly flat expanded 
limb of two and a half inches across. The 
flowers are very abundantly produced at the 
latter end of the summer. The plant grows 
on the mountains of Mexico. Schiede found 
it at a great elevation, on the eastern slope of 
the Mexican Andes, near Chiconquinaco, and 
near San Salvador, or the eastern slope of 
Cofre de Perote. Hartweg also met with it 
on the mountains of Orizaba. The true jalap 
plant seems to have been first sent from 
Mexico by Dr. Houston ; at least seeds sent 
by him produced plants with smooth leaves, 
the Convolvulus Jalapa having downy leaves. 
Dr. Coxe, of Philadelphia, sent living roots 



394 



THE NATIONAL TASTE FOR GARDENING. 



to Dr. A. T. Thompson, in 1831. About the 
same time, Ledanois sent the root to Paris, 
and Schiede, travelling in Mexico, sent it to 
Germany. It was cultivated in the Botanic 
Garden of Edinburgh, in 1838, from roots 
sent by Dr. Coxe. It is also cultivated in the 
collection of the Horticultural Society, and 
that of the Society of Apothecaries at Chelsea. 

The plant has borne many names. It has 
been called Ipomcea Jalapa (Nuttal), /. 
Pur g a (Wenderoth), /. Schiediana (Zucca- 
rini), I. officinalis (Pelletan), Convolvulus 
Jalapa (Schiede, not that of Linnaeus), Exo- 
gonium Purga (Bentham). 

Treated as an ornamental plant, its culti- 
vation is very easy. The roots should be 
planted in spring, and forwarded in a green- 
house, or cold frame, and then planted 
out in May ; or they may be kept in 
pots and set out of doors ; in either case they 
will grow freely. The branches will require 
some kind of support suitable to the position 
they are placed in. Those planted out must 
be taken up before they are injured by frost, 
and the roots stored among dryish soil, and 
kept free from frost and damp. Potted roots 
map be partially dried off and set aside under 
similar circumstances. In the following spring 
they should be again excited. Cuttings taken 
at any time "will root freely, but if they are 
taken off early in the season, they will form 
good strong flowering plants for the same 
year ; they may be taken off almost in the 
same way as Dahlia cuttings are managed. 
The soil should consist of any light, rich 
loam. On the continent, according to Royle, 
it is cultivated in the open air. Frost will, 
however, destroy it ; a tuber in the Edinburgh 
Botanic Garden, the crown of which was in- 
jured by frost, was thus killed ; it was then 
grown successfully in a cold frame during 
winter and spring, and uncovered in sum- 
mer and autumn. 

THE NATIONAL TASTE EOR GARDENING. 

There is nothing conduces more to the 
interest of gardening in this country than 
taste exhibited in public establishments. No- 
thing has done so much damage as the absence 
of taste in the parks. Now, while we are 
expending millions on public works in Ire- 
land, and literally fooling away money in 
many other projects, where would be the im- 
propriety of laying out a few thousands to 
render the national gardens worthy of the 
high standing we hold among nations ? We 
encourage the arts and sciences in general 
rather extravagantly, if not judiciously ; why 
not show the world that gardening in this 
country is one of the sciences in which we 
excel ? Why allow the ornamental portion of 
St. James's Park to look like a botch, without 



order or system, and remain as it is, the mere 
receptacle for cheap lots of common shrubs, 
picked up at bankrupt sales ? Is there any 
thing unreasonable in a desire to see as good 
a garden for the public to walk in as the 
wealthy classes enjoy at home ? Is the inno- 
cent enjoyment of a luxury by the working 
classes of no consequence ? Surely the na- 
tional pride is worth encouraging and grati- 
fying when it can be done by the employment 
of a little labour in the royal grounds about 
the metropolis. If the lower classes have been 
taught to grumble at state extravagance in 
those things which they cannot enjoy, it is 
because there does not seem to be an attempt 
to provide any thing in which they can parti- 
cipate. We remember there was a great 
hubbub about spending seventy thousand 
pounds on Her Majesty's stables, because the 
grumblers neither saw the building, nor par- 
ticipated in the use of it ; but there has been 
no grumbling about the million expended on 
the Houses of Parliament, because every poor 
man feels himself a part proprietor. The 
humble classes exult in the possession of a 
noble structure ; the national pride is roused 
a little, and the most needy tax-payer feels 
he has something for his money. There has 
now been an enormous quantity of spluttering 
about the gardens at Frogmore, because the 
only notions the London public can form 
about Royal Gardens, is that founded on the 
abortion in the Park. Let John Bull have 
something to enjoy out of the public expendi- 
ture, and he i*ejoices rather than flags in the 
payment of his share. When was a voice raised 
by the most turbulent class against the pur- 
chases made for the British Museum ? The 
public runs a little wild sometimes when un- 
fortunately excited ; but there is never any 
outcry against improvements that benefit all, 
though there is naturally an objection to the 
sort of things from which the public derive 
nothing, or which appertain to the rich only. 
In laying out" the new parks and improving 
the old ones, everybody would agree to extra- 
ordinary costs ; but while the authorities form 
drives for the rich, let them not forget walks 
for the poor; and instead of raking up all the 
cheap lots at a sale of some bankrupt's stock 
to plant with, let us hope there will be some 
attempt to do properly all that is done. But 
we have always maintained that part of the 
enormous income of the state should be ex- 
pended in forming gardens as well as parks 
for the public. Whatever affords innocent 
enjoyment, does a national good. The thou- 
sands who resort to public-houses when they 
have done business should have every temp- 
tation to go where there is less expenditure 
and less mischief, and this should be placed 
among other things on the credit side against

the expenditure. Not only so, but the very- 
act of keeping up gardens entails the greater 
part of the expense in labour, the employ- 
ment of which is itself a national benefit. 
There would doubtless be a great outcry in the 
House of Commons, perhaps, too, in the 
House of Lords, against this enormous expen- 
diture, but why should there be ? If the people 
who have to pass the bills have gardens of 
their own, they represent millions who have 
not, and who go through life without such en- 
joyment, although the health and morals of the 
community would be improved by the money 
thus laid out. And let us remind those who 
dispense the taxes in all sorts of expenses, 
that as a matter of information they should 
look to the enormous amount paid by the 
poor upon all exciseable articles, and in import 
duties on things from abroad ; and then the 
injustice of refusing sufficient to make gar- 
dens for the public, will strike them forcibly. 



There is, in fact, no reason why the royal 
gardens and parks open to the public, should 
be worse kept than Frogmore or Chatsworth ; 
and the cost would not be enormous, for, the 
outlay once made, the annual expense could 
be calculated to a fraction. There may be a 
less choice of subjects and more difficulty in 
keeping up a garden at St. James's Park than at 
Hampton Court, or even Battersea and Hack- 
ney ; but, above all things, the garden of St. 
James's, with the advantage of the ornamental 
water, ought to be as rich in all things that 
will grow as it could be made, seeing that it 
is under the very eyes of royalty, close to the 
regal palace, and every way demanding and de- 
serving attention. The paltry fountain should 
be replaced with a decent one, or, at all events, 
removed from so conspicuous a site. The 
plantation's require to be cleared of a good deal 
of common rubbish, huddled together without 
arrangement, and planted without taste. 



NOTES ON FLORIST'S FLOWERS. 

BY GEORGE GLENNT. 



The most remarkable of the seedlings pro- 
duced at recent shows have been rendered so 
by the distinctions awarded to them ; for in- 
stance, Mr. Miller of Ramsgate has exhibited 
several new Geraniums ; one called Distinc- 
tus, which was the best of them, has been 
rejected as unworthy of a prize ; while 
Grandis, which was in every point inferior, 
and not worth cultivating by a collector of 
taste, was honoured with a certificate. The 
others, Pompona, Queen of Kent, Jenny Lind, 
Brilliant, and Marginata, may be called 
pretty, and, if not in advance, not far behind 
some of the favourites already in cultivation. 
Mr. Beck exhibited several, and among them 
four which had prizes. Purple Aurora did 
not deserve one by any means, it was incon- 
siderate, to say the least, and lessened the value 
of the prizes of those which did deserve them. 
Favonius has a good petal, large flower and 
bx-ight colour. JiEcheon is showy, though the 
back petals are frilled a good deal; and 
Anne is a neat pretty flower. It is impossible, 
however, to overlook the fact that there is a 
great sameness among a number of the so 
called novelties. We have seen a fancy gera- 
nium, fit for bedding out, called Jenny Lind, 
honoured with a prize, while Queen Adelaide, 
a fancy flower of considerable merit and much 
higher qualities, was passed over. Among the 
Pansies there was a flower, called Potentate, 
neither self nor ground, but a struggle between 
both, the eye being a confused mixture of 
blue, white, and black, and the black breaking 
into the colour : it had a prize, but never can 
deserve it, be it grown how it may. Jenny 
Lind was pretty, but the texture bad, and 



ought not to have had a prize ; but the judges 
thought otherwise, and with all its faults it 
will be grown. In Pinks there are two or 
three advances. Wilmer of Sunbury has 
shown three or four that will be grown, but 
one of them is worthy of a place among the 
best. Laura has pleased everybody else as 
well as us, and received a certificate at the 
metropolitan show, which is a warranty in 
general. Harvey is pretty, and will be grown. 
Black Prince and Arthur are faulty ; and 
indeed Laura is the only one that is novel as 
well as good. Two pinks exhibited by Turner 
and Norman are highly promising, the petals 
being very good indeed — Turner's Double X, 
and Norman's X.Y.Z.; both are acquisitions, 
and must be had, though X.Y.Z. is not so 
full as we should like to see it, and probably 
shall see it. Both these flowers advance the 
right way ; the petals are thick, broad and rose- 
edged. Smith has shown a Rosy Verbena, 
Lady Webster, very broad in the lobes, but 
not free from the notch ; one of somebody 
else's, without a single good point, had a prize 
at the Surrey Gardens. Upon the whole we 
never saw worse adjudications than took place 
at the last show of the South London Florists; 
and we can say this the more freely without 
offending the exhibitors, because prizes were 
given to right men if not right flowers. 

At Rosherville Gardens, which are the 
best adapted for a show of any that we have 
seen, the Geranium of Mr. Miller's called 
Distinctus was exhibited in good order, and 
fully maintained the opinion we gave of it at 
the Surrey show. A flower called Rosa 
Mundi is also very pretty, and deserves a 



396

place ; these two geraniums are better enti- 
tled to honours than some that have had 
them. Among the Pinks exhibited, the best 
were Bragg's George Glenny, Henbrey's 
Lady Hare. The best of the Fuchsias 
shown were Napoleon, Duchess of Suther- 
land, Delicata, JSTym])h, Empress, Countess 
of Corjiwallis. Most people were admiring 
Colossus and Cassandra, but the fault of the 
former is, that it is coarse and large ; the 
corolla, although dark when it first comes out, 
and forming something like a contrast, though 
slight, soon loses the distinction, and is an un- 
mitigated ugly subject ; Cassandra is ragged 
compared with several in the same style. Mr. 
Veitch's new Trop-s:olum is a decided 
novelty, and must be grown by all who pre- 
tend to cultivate any of the family. It is a 
large flower, not a close nor a round one like 
the ordinary nasturtium, nor is it compact 
like Lobbianum, but it is a brilliant scarlet, 
rather reminding one of a windmill with the 
outer half widened, — plenty to show off a gay 
and curious bloom when the plant is in per- 
fection, and affording a singular illustration of 
the extraordinary differences in the form of 
the various flowers. There can hardly be a 
greater contrast than might be found in a 
collection of these subjects : — tricolorum, or 
any of its larger varieties, red and black; 
brachyceras, bright yellow ; azurreum, blue; 



Lobbianum, dark orange ; the new one, scarlet; 
atrosanguineum, dark ; tuberosum, striped 
orange. We have still to urge upon the gar- 
deners the necessity of abandoning the shield- 
like trellises upon which they grow these and 
other climbers ; the style is nothing like 
nature, and we are surprised that they allow 
us, who can only boast of being an amateur, 
to dictate to them upon subjects that their 
own sense ought to render unnecessary. We 
have been years trying to cure them of this, 
and of propping up every sprig of a geranium ; 
and they give way so reluctantly that we 
succeed in showing the public the absurdity 
of a practice before the headstrong growers 
will see it. The public now ridicule the 
hundred props which the geranium growers 
are obliged to use to keep those miserable 
monster plants from hanging over the pot; 
and we have convinced ladies and gentlemen 
of the folly of allowing themselves to be 
charmed by any thing, however gay, if it is 
unnaturally grown, and incapable of supporting 
itself without sticks. As usual, when we, by 
pointing out the folly of encouraging such 
things, have disgusted the public with them, 
other writers pretend to have made the dis- 
covery as a new thing, and even the leader 
at a show, where this has been encouraged for 
years, has j ust found out that it is a wrong prac- 
tice, and proposes that it should be abandoned. 



CEPHALOTUS FOLLICULARIS. 

THE NEW HOLLAND PITCHER PLANT. 



Scarcely any subjects among the many 
vegetable productions which may fitly be classi- 
fied as natural curiosities, attract more notice 
than the pitcher plants, — plants which are 
furnished with very remarkable and unique 
urn-like appendages which botanists distinguish 
as ascidia, but which, in more familiar lan- 
guage, are called pitchers. Several genera of 
plants produce these appendages ; but the 
title of Pitcher-plants is more exclusively con- 
ferred on the species of Nepenthes, which are 
stove plants of a straggling habit, furnished 
with long narrow leaves, from the end of the 
more perfect of which the pitchers, or ascidia, 
are dependant : some of these produce stems 
from ten to twenty feet long, and bear very 
numerous pitchers. 

The Ceiihalotus follicidaris, represented 
in the annexed engraving, differs materially 
from these, although it bears very perfect as- 
cidia. It has however no other point of 
resemblance with those just referred to, being 
altogether of a distinct natural family, and 
having a totally different habit of growth. It 
is in fact regarded as an isolated species, 
having no direct affinity with any other 
known plant, and it is accordingly now sta- 



tioned in a separate natural order, alone con- 
stituted by itself, and of which the proper 
station and affinities are an unsettled point. 
The evidence at present seems to lean to- 
wards their being ranged in the crowfoot 
alliance. This small and unsettled natural 
order is named Cephalotacese. 

The plant is a small herbaceous perennial ; 
when out of flower it forms a close little 
tuft of two or three inches in height, from 
which the flower-stem springs, and forms an 
erect spike of a foot or more in height. The 
root is somewhat fusiform, often dividing at 
the upper part, from which is produced a 
cluster of elliptic lance-shaped, entire, thickish, 
nerveless leaves ; among which, but chiefly 
occupying the circumference, are placed the 
several beautiful and highly curious ascidia, 
attached to the plant by rather stout stalks 
fixed to the upper part of the pitcher, as it 
were at the back of each, where the lid also 
is fixed on to it. The form of the ascidia is 
ovate, or somewhat slipper shaped, and they 
are furnished with two lateral oblique wings, 
and one central one, the latter remarkably 
dilated at the margin, and all beautifully 
fringed with hairs ; they are green tinged 



CEPHALOTUS FOLLTCULARIS.

with purple, and are nearly of the same tex- 
ture as the leaves, but somewhat more mem- 
branous ; the mouth is contracted, horse-shoe- 
shaped, annulated, and crested with several 
deep sharp vertical annuli of a dark purple 
colour ; the lid, which at first closes this 
mouth, but afterwards becomes nearly erect, 
is plano-convex, green and somewhat hairy 
without, clouded with purple within, and 
scalloped at the margin ; the inside is clouded 
with dark purple, and contains a watery fluid, 
which entraps many insects, especially ants. 
The chief interest of the plant attaches to 
these remarkable appendages. The flowers 
are small, greenish white, without petals, and 
borne on a spicate raceme, which grows up 
a foot high and upwards. It is met with in 
various parts of New Holland, in boggy places, 
chiefly near the coast ; it flowers there in 
December. The first living plants which were 
introduced appear to have been placed in the 
Royal Gardens at Kew in 1823. It blooms 
there in August. 




The Cephalotus is a bog plant, and there- 
fore delights in moisture. Indeed, the two 
chief requisites in its artificial cultivation, 
seem to be a regular supply of moisture at 
the root, and an equally moist and calm at- 
mosphere. It is often kept in a stove, on 
account of the facility there afforded for sup- 
plying these conditions, but it does not require 
the heat of the stove. It should be potted in 
a wide shallow pot, half-filled with pieces of 
broken potsherd and charcoal, a fourth of 
roughish lumps of fibry peat soil, mixed with 
small lumps of charcoal, and the remainder 
close about the base of the plant, with common 
sphagnum and hypnum moss, cut short, that 
is, into pieces of about an inch in length ; 
these materials must be carefully placed in 
the pots, the roots of the plants spread out 



among the peaty soil, and the cut moss very 
carefully and compactly as well as neatly laid 
about the base of the plants under the leaves 
and pitchers. To the surface a little fresh 
cut moss should from time to time be added, 
both to keep a neat appearance, and also to 
give the plant the benefit of a fresh supply of 
material about it, as the former decreases in 
bulk through decomposition. The pots should 
be set into garden pans, which should be 
pretty well supplied with water, so that the 
soil and material in the pots may be constantly 
supplied by capillary attraction, but must not 
be suffered to stand in the pans and become 
stagnated ; it should be often changed, and 
the pot may stand without a fresh supply for 
a day or so ; then it may be given as before. 
The surface of the moss about the plant will 
hardly require to be directly supplied with 
water, as it will draw up enough from be- 
neath; but in case it should be getting some- 
what dry, it may be sprinkled over slightly 
so as to keep it moist. A bell-glass should 
usually be placed over the plant. If it be 
in a plant-stove, where there is a close humid 
atmosphere, then the glass may be removed 
during the night, and sometimes in the day, 
when the sun is not powerful and there is not 
a draught of cold or dry air rushing into the 
house. If kept in the greenhouse, the glass 
should be usually kept over the plants. They 
prefer a somewhat shaded to an exposed situ- 
ation, that where they are partially overhung by 
contiguous plants being very suitable for them. 
In the garden of Sir W. Molesworth, at 
Pencarrow in Cornwall, the Cephalotus has 
been grown under certain conditions out of 
doors, with merely the protection of a hand- 
glass.* Those conditions were as follows : — 
In a large piece of rockwork at Pencarrow, 
a bog or swamp of irregular shape, averaging 
nine feet in diameter, was formed; this is well 
sheltered and shaded from the sun. Above 
is a reservoir from which, by means of a pipe, 
a greater or less supply of water is obtained, 
just as may be deemed requisite. When this bog 
was formed, the ground being porous, a layer 
of wet clay was put at the bottom ; on this, a 
mixture of turfy peat and a very little de- 
cayed leaf mould ; and on the top a layer of 
sphagnum, with some of its decayed roots, and 
some of its natural soil that was under the roots. 
Four years ago, some Sarracenias (another 
kind of pitcher-plant) were planted in the bog 
under the hand-glass, and have grown well. 
Three years ago the Cephalotus planted in 
a similar manner grew very well. In April, 
1846, it was rooted up by a mouse or snail, and 
appeared dead. The roots were all dead, but a 
little life was left in the stem. This was placed 
upon a rotten stump of a tree, that had some

chasms in it, and living moss grooving in it, 
and some perfectly rotten wood. Into one of 
the holes, or chasms, was placed a little fine 
sandy peat, a few knobs of rotten wood, and 
some very much decayed leaf-mould, also a 
little sphagnum, and in this the withered 
stem was planted. The stump was then sunk 
in the middle of the bog, to nearly the level 
of the rim of the hole where the plant was 
placed, so that the percolating water gently 
moved past, and pressed probably in some 
degree through the lower fittings of the hole. 
A small bell-glass was put over the little 



plant, but the edge of the hole being uneven, 
the glass was not air-tight.' Over this was 
put a square iron hand-glass ; it being in 
two parts, the air got in a little between the 
top and bottom. In the middle of hot sunny 
days it is partially shaded. In summer the 
bell-glass is taken off altogether, except when 
the night air is cold ; and in fine weather, the 
top of the hand-glass is turned, so that through 
the angles the air has full access to the plant. 
"With this treatment the plant attained a 
vigorous growing state, and produced many 
of its beautiful pitchers. 





POLEMONIUM CCEEULEUM. 

(Linn<zm.) 
GREEK VALERIAS, OR JACOB'S LADDER. 



The Greek Valerian is a common hardy 
perennial plant, of a very ornamental charac- 
ter, and perfectly easy of cultivation. 

It belongs to the natural group of Polemo- 
niacese, to which also belongs the Phlox, the 
Gilia, and some other of our gay border 
flowers. It is a nauseously bitter plant ; in 
Siberia poultices prepared from its leaves are 
thought serviceable in syphilitic eruptions ; 
and the Russians fancy that a decoction of it 
is useful in hydrophobia. 

The plant is perfectly hardy. It produces 
a tuft of pinnate glabrous leaves, which are 
composed of several pairs of oblong-lanceo- 
late leaflets placed alternately ; the stalks rise 
about a foot and a half or two feet high, and 
are channelled, and furnished with smaller 
leaves of the same form as the lower ones ; 
the stems are terminated by bunches of blos- 
som;, which are large, wheel-shaped — that is, 
with a short tube and spreading border — and 
are produced in the latter end of May, and j 
through June and July. It is met with in 
various parts of Europe, and is found, though j 
very rarely, in some parts of Britain. 



There are some varieties : — The most com- 
mon kind produces flowers of a pretty blue 
colour ; another bears white flowers ; another 
has variegated blossoms; and a fourth variety, 
also bearing blue flowers, has variegated 
foliage. 

The seeds are always to be obtained with 
facility in the seed shops, and by their means 
the plant is best propagated, as young seed- 
ling plants are more vigorous than plants 
raised by the ordinary process of division. 
To obtain a succession of flowers, seeds should 
be sown at two periods ; first, in August, 
along wuth other perennials for early bloom- 
ing the following year, and then again in 
February, to flower late in the year. Those 
sown in August should be sown on a bed of 
common garden soil, covered about a quarter 
of an inch with fine soil, and kept well 
watered if the weather is dry ; they will 
soon germinate, and the young plants, when 
they have formed a pair or two of leaves, 
should be transplanted into a prepared bed of 
fine soil — good, but not very rich; for if they 
grow too luxuriantly, they are more liable to 



BOTANICAL TERMS.

suffer from frost ; they must be shaded and 
kept well watered until they begin to grow 
afresh. At this planting they should be set 
four or six inches apart. Here they are to 
remain till spring ; but as very severe frosts 
are apt to injure young seedlings even of 
hardy plants, it is desirable that in severe 
weather a covering of loose open litter, such 
as peas haulm, may be laid over them as a 
slight protection. As early in March as the 
weather will permit, these plants are to be 
transferred to the places where they are to 
bloom ; and if the weather is dry and keen 
about the time they are transplanted, they 
must be watered. These will bloom in May 
and June. 

The spring sowing must be made in a box 
and set in a cold frame, or, perhaps, to induce 
germination, where there is a very slight heat, 
and afterwards placed in a cold frame ; when 
they have formed two pairs of leaves, let 
them be transplanted as with the other, in a 
sheltered border of good soil, where they will 
grow rapidly. In April or May, when large 
enough, they may be transplanted carefully 
to the borders, and will bloom at the latter 
end of the summer. 

Division of the old plants may also be 
resorted to early in autumn, in which case 
they become well established for blooming 
the following season. Seedling plants are 
usually stronger than those obtained by divi- 
sion, but where only a few plants are required, 
the latter mode, which is the least trouble- 
some, will be sufficient to keep up the supply. 
The white flowered and variegated leaved 
varieties ought, however, to be increased 
by division, as they cannot be increased 
with certainty from seeds, the seeds of the 
white variety often producing plants with 
blue flowers. The month of September is 
proper for transplanting and dividing them. 

The seeds usually ripen about August, and 
for the first sowing may be used immediately ; 
a supply for spring sowing, when resorted to, 
should be gathered, and dried, and stored by 
in papers, as is usual with other seeds. 

There are some other species of Polemo- 
nium grown in our gardens, of which P. 
reptans, a dwarf species with pale blue 
flowers ; P. sibiricum, a species resembling 
P. ccendeum, but having elegant white flowers; 
and P. humile, a dwarf kind with large blue 
flowers, are the most commonly seen, and per- 
haps the best for general purposes.

BARNADESIA ROSEA. 

(Lindley.) 
ROSE-COLOURED BARNADESIA. 



This plant belongs to that section of com- 
posite plants to which the name of Mutisiaceas 
has been applied. It is one of the smaller 
groups of species into which this large order 
of plants is divided, and most of its members 
exhibit a singular and very elegant struc- 
ture, and some, as in the case of Barnadesia, 
possess considerable beauty. The Mutisiaceaa 
form one of the two divisions into which the 
labiatifloral composites (that is, those in which 
the hermaphrodite or unisexual florets are 



divided into two lips) ; the other division, 
Nassauviaceae, being distinguished from it by 
certain peculiarities in the structure of the 
stigma and style. 

The Barnadesia rosea is not a very hand- 
some plant in its manner of growth, nor is it 
very prolific of blossoms : it is not, therefore, 
adapted for general cultivation, but may be 
regarded as an example of a very beautiful 
flower when viewed individually, both its 
colour and its structure being exceedingly

elegant ; the latter point will indeed be evi- 
dent from an inspection of the engraving. 
In a cultivated state it produces long 
weak slender stems, which, no doubt, in its 
wild state, are semi -trailing, some closely 
allied plants having a more or less climbing 
habit. The leaves are usually alternate, but 
sometimes opposite, or even three together ; 
they are of an obovate-lance-shaped figure, 
ending in a sharp point, quite entire or even 
on the margin, and tapering at the base into 
a short petiole or footstalk ; they are of a 
lively green colour. At that part of the stem 
where the leaves are situated, and also where 
a branch issues from the stem, one or two 
short straight sharp spines are often, indeed 
usually, produced. The flower-heads — or 
flowers, as they would be commonly termed — 
are large, about an inch and a half in diameter ; 
they are produced singly at the end of a 
branch, two or three leaves being set close to 
their base. In botanical language this head 
of flowers is called a capitidum, and it con- 
sists of four obvious parts, besides the rudi- 
ments of the seeds which are enclosed, and 
therefore not apparent unless the flower-head 
is pulled asunder : these parts are the invo- 
lucre, the florets, the anthers, and the stigma; 
the involucre consists of numerous appressed 
scales closely imbricated, that is, lying over 
one another like the tiles of a roof; the 
lowermost of these scales which invest the 
base of the flower-head are of an ovate 
acutely pointed figure, and a greenish colour; 
the upper ones are very much longer, almost 
linear in figure, and becoming rose-coloured, 
the same hue as the florets : the florets — each 
of which, it must be remembered, form a 
perfect flower — are two-lipped, the outer lip 
ligulate or strap-shaped, with four small teeth 
at the end, the inner filiform, curved and 
spreading ; the colour is a rich deep rose : the 
anthers, as in all composite or syngenesious 
plants, are united, in this case, surrounding 
the style, which extends beyond them, and is 
terminated by an obliquely truncate stigma ; 
the seeds, which are ranged on the receptacle 
at the base of the flower-head, and connected 
each with a floret, by means of a long slender 
tube, are seen, when separated from the other 
parts of the capitulum, to have a crown of 
rigid feathery hairs, which, as in the well- 
known example of the dandelion, (Taraxa- 
cum vulgare,) are designed for the dissemina- 
tion of the seeds ; this machinery, however, 
called the pappus, is variable in its appear- 
ance and structure, and in this case is very 
different from that of the dandelion. 

Little is known of the history of this plant. 
It is a native of South America, but its pre- 
cise locality is unknown. Sir W, J. Hooker 
has specimens both from Peru and Brazil, 



which he regards as being the same. It was 
introduced, about 1838, to the collection of 
the Duke of Northumberland at Syon, where 
it blossoms in the stove during the winter 
months. It should be potted in a mixture of 
two thirds peat and one third loam, in a rough 
state, and made porous by the addition of 
sand ; it must not be overpotted, and requires 
careful watering. Cuttings root with some 
difficulty in moderate heat.

cauliflowers, endive, herbs, lettuce, and water- 
cress. 

General Directions. — It is an excellent 
sign of good management, to see that every 
part of the garden is covered with a useful 
crop. G-ather and properly store the ripen- 
ing crops of all kinds ; and remove such as 
peas, beans, &c. when they have done bearing ; 
where it can be done, trench the ground 
and replant it immediately. Suffer no weeds 
to run to seed ; and allow no crop to suffer 
for want of thinning, hoeing, or watering. 
Earth up advancing crops when dry. 

Angelica. — Sow as soon as the seed is ripe, 
in a rich loam, and rather a shady place. 

Borage. — Sow a little in any common soil, 
and almost any situation ; a few plants will 
suffice. 

Brocoli. — The last planting for the season 
should now be made as soon as possible ; re- 
move the decayed leaves from the early crops. 

Cabbage. — Sow a few to remain in the bed 
all the winter : make a thick planting, say 
at six inches in the row, and sixteen between 
the rows; in the winter every other plant 



may be drawn for use, and the others left till 
the spring. 

Cardoons. — Earth up the stems of such 
as have nearly attained maturity ; this should 
only be done when they are quite dry. 

Carrots. — Sow in a warm spot ; and to- 
wards the end of the month a slight hot-bed 
may be made for another sowing, but this is 
seldom necessary ; go over the main early 
sowings, and remove all seed weeds. 

Cauliflowers require protection in the 
winter, and provision must be made now, after 
any or all of the following plans : — On the 
warmest border that can be selected, fill as 
many hand-lights as will be required, planting 
them from four to six inches apart ; or use a 
frame similarly ; or plant them at the foot of 
the garden wall in different aspects, and 
slightly protect them when the weather is 
severe. Another good plan is to pot them, 
putting the best singly, and keeping them in 
a frame or cold house close to the glass. In 
all cases, after a few days, give air profusely. 
Those ready for use must be cut and pre- 
served till wanted ; and at the end of the 
month the most forward may be planted 
thickly into a frame, where they will continue 
to produce their flower heads, and will last till 
the brocoli comes in. 

Celery. — Earth up slightly all except the 
latest crops ; do not bank them up too much ; 
a small proportion only should be fully earthed 
up, to keep a supply in succession ; it must 
be done when they are quite dry. 

Chervil. — Scatter a little more seed in any 
spare corner, if it is much in request. 



412 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR SEPTEMBER. 



Coriander is best sown in autumn ; give it 
an open situation, and rich fresh soil. 

Cress. — Select a rather sunny place to 
make a sowing at the end of the month. 

Dill. — Sow soon after the seeds are ripe, 
in a light soil. 

Endive. — Plant a few more out where they 
can receive slight protection in winter ; choose 
a dry day to tie up, or cover up, a few of the 
best for blanching, which must be attended 
to from time to time, so as to keep a succession 
fit for use. 

Serbs. — Almost all the sorts may be in- 
creased now, either by division of the roots or 
by seeds. Tie up the parts gathered for 
winter use in small bundles, hang them in a 
dry place ; some use an oven for drying ; and 
gather off the leaves, and keep them in tin 
canisters, which is an excellent plan, as it 
preserves the aroma of the herb. 

Lettuces. — Plant out at the foot of the 
walls, also in hand-lights ; where they are 
much required, planting out in a frame will be 
necessary. 

Onions. — Gather as soon as they stop 
growing, and lay in a dry place preparatory 
to storing them away : they may be kept 
either tied up in ropes, or spread on shelves 
or a dry wood floor, whichever is most con- 
venient. 

Parsley. — It is scarcely advisable to sow 
any more this season, but the early crops or 
part of them will be made more useful by 
being cut over, and made to spring anew. 

Potatoes when ripe must be taken up, 
carefully laying aside all the diseased ones, 
and spreading the whole out to dry ; after 
which remove them to the store-house, and 
spread them on the floor. Where young 
potatoes are wanted at Christmas, now is the 
time to plant such varieties as Chapman's 
kidney, in a slight heat, in small pots. 

Radishes must be sown on a slight hot-bed, 
and require plenty of air. 

Salads generally will require some slight 
artificial air ; a little hot dung and frames 
must be used at the end of the month. 

Spinach. — Thin out the plants, leaving 
them from six to nine inches apart ; another 
sowing may be made soon in a good situation. 

Tomatoes. — Cut away most of the young 
shoots, so as to expose the fruit to the sun ; 
and cut away also all very late fruit : ripen 
off the early ones by laying them in the stove 
or greenhouse, or in a close frame. 

Turnips may yet be sown in a very warm 
place, but do not depend much upon them : at- 
tend to the thinning and hoeing of the earlier 
sowings ; those that are too late for bulbing 
may be worth attention for their tops. 

Water Cress. — New beds may now be 
formed, and planted at six inches apart ; the 



old established beds should be dried off and 
cleaned, and all blanks filled up with vigorous 
young plants. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Look over and pick 
daily the ripening fruit of all the finer sorts. 
Finish the summer thinning, pruning, and 
nailing, having given all the light and sun 
attainable. Keep down vermin, such a3 
wasps, &c. ; allow the blemished fruit to 
remain close under the walls to entice them, 
and kill them when collected together ; pro- 
tect the finer fruit of such as peaches, by cover- 
ing with fine gauze. The fruit room requires 
close attention. Turn anew those fruit that 
were early gathered, and pick out all which 
indicate the smallest blemish ; lay the best 
carefully in a single tier on shelves, and keep 
the place dark. The inferior sorts may be 
laid thicker, but must at no time be suffered to 
heat ; and remember to use these first. If the 
fruit room is exposed to the sun, air must be 
given to prevent sweating, which is always 
injurious. Always handle choice fruit as if 
they were eggs ; and indeed fruit of all kinds 
as far as practicable. 

Apples. — When gathering the keeping 
sorts be sure they are ripe ; cut a fruit or two 
open, and if the pips are still white — not 
turning brown — they are not ready. 

Apricots. — Look over every morning, and 
pick the ripe ones ; there is no other method 
by which the fruit can be kept free from 
blemish. 

Cherries. — The morellos must be protected 
from birds, &c. Syringe the trees of the 
early sorts with clear water, in which soot 
and wood ashes have been steeped. 

Currants. — Those which are to be pre- 
served must be kept matted perfectly close, 
for if the least aperture is allowed, the birds 
may enter and injure them. 

Figs. — Gather in the morning : it may be 
well to cover the finest fruit with gauze, or 
cotton wadding. 

Filberts may now be gathered when dry 
and packed in hampers for keeping. 

Gooseberries. — Those which are matted up 
for preserving must be carefully covered 
again after being gathered from. 

Nectarines and Peaches. — Preserve from 
vermin, and hand pick the ripe fruit daily. If 
the walls are flued apply a little fire in the 
day time to ripen the wood. 

Pears are not so easily damaged as apples, 
but the keeping sorts must be gathered with 
equal care, and laid thinly on the shelves : 
look over the early sorts, and remove the 
blemished ones. 

Plums. — Pick those to be used for dessert 
just as they are thoroughly ripe ; when ga-

thered in quantity spread them thinly out in 
the fruit room. 

Strawberries. — Make new plantations on a 
deep and rich loamy soil, in rows thirty inches 
apart and eighteen inches in the row. Re- 
move all runners from the old plantations, 
and top dress with a rich soil of loam and 
decomposed dung. 

Vines. — Where these are growing upon 
flued walls it is well and safe to apply a little 
fire now, to hasten the ripening both of the 
wood and fruit. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — The present period 
nearly answers to winter in this department : 
keep the trees at rest. Clean out all the 
houses, frames, and pits which are emptied of 
fruit ; white-wash the flues and walls with 
hot lime, and top-dress and prune the early 
houses. Renew the hotbed linings as required. 
Upon the whole, considerably less water will 
be required now than formerly. 

Apricots. — Remove the ripening leaves, 
and keep the trees cool and clean. 

Cherries. — Those in pots must not have 
much water, and if they have been exposed 
they may be put under glass : keep the house 
always open except in heavy rains : pass the 
hand lightly up the shoots to clear off the 
dead leaves. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature from 60 to 90 
degrees. Renew the linings so as to keep up 
a brisk heat ; shut up about two o'clock p.m. ; 
the heat must be steady, and moist. The 
winter plants must be kept scrupulously 
clean and healthful, and are best trained on 
a trellis. Fruits reserved for seeds may be 
cut open, the seed slightly washed, and 
thoroughly dried. 

Figs. — Temperature from 60 to 80 degrees. 
Clean off the ripening foliage : put a few of 
the pots (which were very early) in readiness 
to be again placed in heat ; water as little as 
possible. 

Melons. — Temperature from 65 to 90 de- 
grees. Maintain a lively heat by means of lin- 
ings : water only in the mornings, and then 
sparingly : give air at night to the ripening 
fruit, and shut up the late crops early, with 
strong sun heat. 

Musas. — Temperature from 70 to 90 de- 
grees. Keep the atmosphere moist, excepting 
where the fruit is ripening. On those planted 
out two suckers may be allowed to remain at- 
tached to the parent, and some fresh soil 
should be laid about them, the old stem being 
cut away close to the ground. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature from 55 to 60 
degrees. When the heat of the prepared suc- 
cession bed has declined so as to be about milk- 
warm (it should never have been overheated 



previously) it may be spawned, by wrapping 
the pieces of spawn first in a little strawy dry 
litter, which will assist its running ; after a 
few days the covering of fresh loam to the 
thickness of two inches should be put on, and 
firmly beaten down. The beds in a bearing 
state are benefited by having the loose hay 
strewed over them renewed. 

Nectarines and Peaches. — Temperature 
from 55 to 75 degrees. The late houses must 
have air night and day ; and still more the 
early houses. Pass a broom gently up the 
branches of those whose foliage is ripe, so as 
to remove the leaves when they separate 
easily ; syringe a little with the clear liquor of 
soot, lime, and wood ashes mixed in water; non- 
attendance to trees in this stage ruins many. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature from 70 to 
90 degrees. Keep up a brisk heat : admit air 
at night, unless it is very windy and cold. In 
places where one house is made to grow 
the whole stock, put the ripening fruits at 
the warm end, those just started in the 
middle, and the young plants at the cold 
end. Shift those which require it. Pot 
the strong suckers ; use rough turfy loam, 
peat, and charcoal, and no manure ; give the 
latter in the liquid form, and apply it freely 
to those started into fruit — say once a week ; 
syringe freely. 

Strawberries. — Temperature from 55 to 75 
degrees. Those which are being prepared for 
forcing early in spring should be freed from 
all runners ; and they are amazingly benefited 
by being kept in a frame, to avoid the extreme 
wet to which they would otherwise be subject. 
Give water moderately, and admit plenty of 
air, by tilting up the lights. 

Vinery. — Temperature from 60 to 80 de- 
grees : withhold water, and give air plentifully. 
Remove decaying berries as soon as they are 
observed ; give a little fire heat with air at 
night. The young vines in pots must be 
ripened off ; bring them into a dry house and 
gradually withhold water. Prune the early 
houses ; and have the vines washed with a 
solution of tobacco, sulphur, and lime-water. 

FLOWER GARDEN AND SHRUBBERY. 

Sow hardy annuals as recommended in 
August, and do it early ; also such as polyan- 
thus, primrose, sweet William, Canterbury 
bell, &c. 

Plant and Transplant, perennials, bien- 
nials, and bulbs ; also evergreen and deciduous 
shrubs. Take up and put the finer campanulas 
and the more tender things into pots, to be 
afterwards removed to the frames. 

General Directions. — Continue to propa- 
gate where required. At the end of the 
month, a few of the best specimens of green- 
house plants should be taken up and potted. 



414 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR SEPTEMBER. 



Make notes of the most suitable things to plant 
for the flower garden, and set to work to pro- 
cure and increase them for another year. 

Alpines must be put in their winter quarters 
at the end of the month : make the frame face 
the north, and give air freely : meanwhile 
give them a cleaning and top-dressing. 

Auriculas. — Clear off the yellow leaves and 
decayed stalks : stir the soil and examine the 
drainage : by the end of the month, put them 
in their winter frame, keep them free from 
wet, and admit plenty of air. 

Bidbs (Dutch). — Procure these as soon as 
possible, and have them potted (if early bloom 
is required), and covered six inches with saw- 
dust or coal-ashes, and put in a cool and dry 
situation. All kinds of bulbs may be planted 
out this month, but next month will do : mean- 
while, renew the beds with fresh soil. 

Carnations. — Pot off the rooted layers in 
five-inch pots, using a soil of rotted turf torn 
and broken by the hand ; give thorough drain- 
age, and a dry bottom to the frame. 

Calceolarias. — Increase the good herba- 
ceous sorts by offsets, and by cuttings the 
shrubby sorts ; Kayana is amongst the best of 
the latter class. Seeds may be sown early 
this month, the plants from which will flower 
early in spring ; sow in a slight heat, and 
push them on : use peat and sandy loam. 

Daffodils may either be planted during 
this or the next month ; a deep loamy soil suits 
them. 

Dahlias. — Thin the spray or weak shoots 
when thick ; tie up the branches, and shade 
the best flowers. From the show plants pick 
off and throw away every bad bloom ; also the 
fading blooms, except such as are kept for seed: 
gather seeds early. Striped varieties com- 
mend themselves as border ornaments. 

Fritillarias may be put in now, or taken 
up and increased by division. 

Fuchsias. — Withhold liquid manure, as 
flower and not growth is wanted now : take 
up and pot the most handsome by the end of 
the month. 

SyacintiiS. — Have these ordered immedi- 
ately ; select the most distinct and striking 
colours for general purposes; and rather grow 
a quantity of any good varieties of suitable 
colours, than many different kinds : the single 
sorts are best for forcing, and should be potted 
early. 

Laurels, Laurustinus, and, indeed, every 
other shrub, may now be transplanted with 
safety, and with the greatest success ; they 
may also yet be layered, and struck from cut- 
tings put in sand. 

Lobelias. — Many of these do well to take 
up, and they give a good effect to the green- 
houses for some time after being lifted ; how- 
ever, it is better to defer it till the end of the 



month ; when taken up, let the blank be as 
little seen as can be. 

Mimulus. — Very many kinds are quite 
hardy ; still the finer varieties, being all 
easily raised from cuttings, may be propa- 
gated, and kept under glass for the winter. 

Petunias. — Propagate by cuttings the good 
sorts only. 

P amies may yet be raised from cuttings, 
and will get established before winter : keep 
the finer sorts where they will find shelter. 

Pelargoniums. — Propagate largely of the 
select sorts ; they require no shading and 
little water. 

Picotees. — "Water the layers, and pot off 
those rooted, as with carnations. 

Pinks. — Plant out the well rooted pipings 
in nursery rows in a good situation ; and pot 
the weaker plants. 

Roses. — The Chinese and Tea-scented may 
be slightly pruned, and cuttings made of the 
prunings ; these will root freely under a hand- 
glass, or even in a sheltered border : put the 
finer hybrids in pots, and strike in a slight 
heat or in the greenhouse. 

Salvias. — Increase these extensively now 
by cuttings, and keep them in store pots. 

Stocks. — Pot off the young plants, and put 
them in a frame ; too many of the good sorts 
can hardly be obtained. 

Tulips will be better planted next month ; 
meanwhile prepare good fresh loam, and some 
decomposed cow-dung, to be placed as a layer 
three inches in thickness, below twenty inches 
of soil. 

Verbenas. — Propagate boxfuls and potfuls, 
and keep them in these until spring ; they are 
the better of a slight heat to root in, and re- 
quire to be shaded. 

Wallflowers may still be planted out in 
masses throughout the borders ; stick the 
double sorts, and keep and grow as many as 
can be accommodated. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

If a proper supply of evergreens for winter 
decoration has not been provided, no time 
should be lost in making up the deficiency. 
Neat handsome plants, of any of the hardiest 
sorts, should be potted in the smallest conve- 
nient sized pots, and regularly watered, 
shaded, and otherwise attended to until suf- 
ficiently established. One of the very best 
plants for this purpose is the Aucubajaponica, 
which stands the smoke and dust of the most 
populous towns almost with impunity. Others 
are the Andromeda floribunda and Garrya 
elliptica, possessed of still greater attractions, 
as the first flowers abundantly in March and 
April, and the other still earlier. The list 
may be still further extended with spruce firs, 
red cedars, junipers, arbor-vit£es, laurels,

phillyreas, and nearly any other hardy ever- 
greens. The main points in their manage- 
ment are these : to be careful they do not 
suffer for want of moisture, and in case the 
leaves are frozen, to water the plants over 
head early in the morning, when the frost is 
over, and shade them from the direct rays of 
the sun. 

Bulbs, such as hyacinths, narciss, &c, 
for the earliest crop, especially in glasses, 
should be procured as early in the month as 
possible, and placed in proper places for the 
formation of abundance of roots. If placed 
in pots, they should be plunged in a shady, 
rather dry situation, in coal ashes, or other 
similar materials ; or if in glasses, they should 
be kept in an airy, dark place the better to 
develope their roots. 

Begonias. — Dry off the roots as the bul- 
bous sorts show symptoms of resting, and 
lessen the supply of water to the others, ex- 
cept such as may be growing freely. 

Camellias. — Keep the plants in an airy 
situation, and water very carefully, never 
allowing the ball of earth to become dry. 
Keep the foliage perfectly clean, by washing 
with a sponge if necessary. 

Cinerarias. — Shift such as require it, and 
excite the forwardest plants by placing them 
in a warm exposure, supplying them rather 
plentifully with moisture, and occasionally 
with manure water. 

Fuchsias. — Any that are getting shabby 
should be gradually brought to a state of rest 
by withholding water ; they will push the 
earlier next season. Keep such as are in per- 
fection carefully watered, reducing the quan- 
tity as the days shorten. 

Geraniums. — Shift and stop such as re- 
quire it, but do not stop such as are wanted 
for early flowering. Cut down others as they 
go out of bloom, and let them rest for a month 
without water. 

Myrtles may be treated nearly as directed 
for hardy evergreens, but will need more pro- 
tection as the season draws in : keep the 
foliage clean. 

Roses. — Cut off the decayed blooms of the 
Chinese varieties, and prune the plants to a 
neat shape ; put in cuttings of them under a 
hand-glass if more are wanted. 

Primulas. — Repot as necessary, and encou- 
rage a few with a warm corner for early 
flowering : by this means, and having plants 
of different ages, a very long succession of 
bloom may be kept up. 

Violets. — Pot up from the open ground, 
and plunge the pots in a sheltered place, 
watering very carefully, as they suffer much 
if water is allowed to stagnate round them. 

Wardian Cases. — If the plants have be- 
come shabby, replace them by a winter set. 



Few plants are better adapted for this than 
the smaller and hardier ferns and lycopo- 
diums. Of the latter a pretty contrast is pro- 
duced by L. caesium, L. helveticum. and L. 
stoloniferum. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

The general operations will consist in pre- 
paring for the reception of the plants, in pro- 
viding protective coverings against frost, and 
in the routine work of watering, giving 
air, &c. 

Annuals. — Various of the most interesting 
sorts should be sown in small quantities for 
turning out early, as well as to grow for the 
conservatory. A considerable sowing of 
mignonette should be made, as also of inter- 
mediate and ten week stocks. As soon as the 
plants are up, great attention must be paid to 
giving air at all favourable times to prevent 
the plants drawing up weakly ; and also to 
watering them, as they are very liable to rot 
off if kept too moist. 

BZalf-hardy plants, as calceolarias, pe- 
tunias, verbenas, &c, should be placed in the 
driest pits, where there is means of applying 
heat in severe weather. Continue to pot off 
rooted cuttings, keeping them close and 
shaded until established : also put in cuttings 
of such things as there may be a short stock 
of. These latter should be put in thinly, say 
from ten to twenty in a five inch pot, in which 
they may stand all the winter ; when well 
rooted they may be treated in the same way 
as the others. Fumigate as often as the green 
fly makes its appearance. 

Foiling -pit. — If very early flowers are 
wanted, a batch of lilacs, roses, deutzias, and 
other plants may be placed in the pit about 
the middle or end of the month ; do not close 
the house until the nights become cool, when 
by shutting up early in the afternoon, a suf- 
ficient heat may be maintained for the present. 

But if forced flowers are not wanted until 
Christmas, or after, October will be quite 
soon enough to begin. The plants intended 
for early use may, however, be benefited by 
being placed in the house, and kept rather 
dry, so as to render them more excitable when 
heat is applied. All Dutch or other bulbs in- 
tended for early spring use should be pro- 
cured as soon as possible, potted, and encou- 
raged to fill the pots with roots. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 60 to 70 degrees by 
day, and from 45 to 50 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Leave air on all night, and 
give as much as possible during the day, so 
that the plants from out-doors may not feel 
too sudden a change. 

Watering. — Apply water very carefully, 



416 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR SEPTEMBER. 



but be sure the mass of soil, technically " the 
ball," gets thoroughly moistened whenever it 
is necessary. In hot dry weather the supply 
must still be liberal, but not so liberal as to 
start any plants which may have set their 
growth. 

Potting. — Shift or repot whatever plants 
may require it, but most of the hard-wooded 
plants will stand over till the spring. Ex- 
amine the roots of all that have been exposed 
during summer, before they are staged, and 
see that the drainage is in an efficient state ; 
slightly stir the surface, and add a small coat- 
ing of soil to render the plants neat, and also 
to exterminate moss and weeds. 

Soils. — Make use of fine weather to com- 
plete good supplies of the different earths 
required, and ridge or stack them up so as to 
be well exposed to frost, but not spread about 
too widely so as to be washed by every shower. 

Dressing. — Stake and tie up all plants as 
they are brought into the house, and renew 
rotten or defaced tallies. Remove all faded 
flowers or decaying leaves, and keep every- 
thing scrupulously clean. 

Insects. — Examine the plants carefully, 
and remove all scale, white bug, green fly, or 
other insects by which they may be attacked, 
previously to staging them ; and, if necessary, 
keep the worst in one group, or a separate 
house, so as to have them the more thoroughly 
under command. 

Aloes, and other succulents, should be pro- 
tected from wet, and the smaller and tenderer 
kinds should be removed to a light and airy 
part of the house. 

Agaves, and large succulents, should be 
allowed to dry gradually by reducing the 
supply of water, and protecting them from 
rains, but need not be housed yet. 

Alstromerias should be kept perfectly at 
rest after their foliage dies down, but not so 
dry as to shrivel up the tubers. 

Annuals. — Pot off such as were sown last 
month, or collect self sown plants from the 
open borders, and keep them in frames or pits ; 
sow more of the choice sorts for a succession. 

Azaleas. — House the young plants, and 
such as are wanted first in flower, but keep 
them very cool and airy. The others should 
be protected from heavy rains, but all should 
be carefully and thoroughly watered. 

Calceolarias. — Keep cool at the root by a 
liberal supply of water, and give them an 
airy situation ; shift such as may require it. 

Camellias. — House these towards the mid- 
dle or end of the month, giving plenty of air 
day and night. Place the forwardest plants 
in a rather warmer situation. "Water regu- 
larly and carefully. 

Cafe Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c, should 
still be kept dry, unless any of them should 



show signs of growth, when they should be 
immediately potted, and placed in the coolest 
part of the house, and very sparingly supplied 
with water at first. Keep the others dry, if 
possible until the spring. 

Cephalotus folUcularis (New Holland 
pitcher-plant). — If this has been placed out of 
doors, or in a comparatively cool place, it 
should now be returned to a warmer place, 
and kept regularly damp, with a glass over it. 

Cinerarias. — Continue to propagate, if 
necessary, and shift such as require it : allow 
some to grow away for early flowering, and 
keep the others stopped in, to form large 
bushy plants. 

Chrysanthemums. — Potup layers, and make 
fresh ones of the points of the shoots, so as to 
form dwarf small plants. Cuttings three or 
four inches long may also be struck for the 
same purpose. Shift such as are growing in 
pots into those they are to bloom in, and do 
not stop the shoots after the middle of the 
month. Water liberally, using manure water 
occasionally. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, as semper- 
vivum, should be housed, and very sparingly 
watered. Keep them near the light. 

Cyclamens. — Re-pot the early flowering 
sorts, and keep them in a cool airy place, 
giving very little water for some time. 

Epacris. — House these plants, giving all 
air possible day and night, and watering 
regularly and carefully. 

Ericas. — Get all of these, especially the 
smaller and more delicate kinds, under cover; 
examine the roots very carefully, and give air 
day and night. "Water cautiously, but the 
roots must never be dry The side sashes 
should not be closed, except against strong 
winds or beating rains. If any of the plants 
show signs of mildew, they should be placed 
apart in a pit or frame by themselves, and 
dusted with sulphur ; or other means taken to 
get them clean before they are again placed 
with the rest. 

Fuchsias. — Continue to regulate such as are 
still in a growing and flowering state, assist- 
ing them with manure water occasionally. 
Plants wanted to flower early next year should 
be gradually dried off, and got into a state of 
rest for two or three months, especially those 
with very fleshy or tuberous roots. 

Gompholobiums and slender creepers should 
be housed before any heavy rains, in a 
light airy situation, and should be watered 
very carefully. Continue to regulate the 
shoots of such as are still in a growing state. 

Harvorthias, Apicras, Sfc. should be housed 
by the middle of the month, or earlier if wet 
weather : place them in a dry airy situation, 
and water sparingly, gradually reducing the 
quantity.

lielichrysums. — Get them into the house 
before much rain falls ; place them in an airy 
part, and water carefully. 

Leschenaultias should be housed early, 
placing the smaller plants in a rather warm 
but airy place. Water very carefully, but 
mind that the bottom or centre of the ball of 
roots does not get dry, or death will most 
likely result. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan Lily). — Pot any 
that are making a start to grow, and place 
them in a cool frame. Turfy loam and sand 
with a little peat and leaf mould will suit 
them well. Water very sparingly. 

Mignonette. — Sow in pots, and plunge 
them in frames or pits near the glass ; give 
air at all times, in rainy or windy weather by 
tilting the sashes on the side opposite to the 
wind : water very carefully, gradually re- 
ducing the quantity as the weather becomes 
colder. Keep the tree mignonette regularly 
stopped and tied up. 

New Holland Plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiaaas, &c. may be housed towards the end 
of the month, or sooner if the weather prove 
wet. As protection from excessive wet, or 
strong winds, is all that these plants require 
as yet, they should receive all the air that can 
be given them, day and night, until the nights 
begin to get frosty. 

Orange trees. — Protect from heavy rains 
and strong winds, or place them in winter 
quarters about the end of the month. Water 
regularly and thoroughly, but not so often as 
the weather becomes colder. 

Oxalis. — Pot such of the early flowering 
sorts as commence to grow : a mixture of 
sandy loam and peat suits them well. Many 
of the Cape species appear to thrive in fine 
sand. Water sparingly, until they begin to 
grow vigorously. 

Pelargoniums. — Continue to cut down the 
plants, and shift them into smaller pots as 
they go out of flower. Shift those already 
started, using a richer compost as the plants 
acquire size. Regulate the heads by stopping 
and tying out as they advance. Do not stop 
such as are wanted for winter and spring 
flowering after the middle of the month ; but, 
to maintain a due supply, a few should be 
allowed to grow away at intervals of about a 
fortnight, and a little liquid manure should be 
given them occasionally. 

Primulas. — Continue to shift as requisite, 
keeping them close for a few days afterwards, 
and giving little water at first : pick off the 
flowers from such plants as are wanted to 
attain a large size to bloom in winter and 
spring. Use liquid manure occasionally. 

Proteas, Banlisias, Dryandras, &c. should 
be housed before the roots become soddened 
by rain, giving them a cool airy situation, 
48. 



and placing them so as not to be crowded 
together. 

Rhododendrons. — Protect the tender varie- 
ties from heavy rains and strong winds : keep 
them regularly moist, but not wet, at the root. 

Roses. — Prune and regulate any that are 
planted out to pillars or otherwise in the house, 
thinning the least promising shoots. Reduce 
the supply of water to any that have completed 
their growth. 

Salvias. — Give a final shift, and stake and 
tie out the plants to the desired form. Use a 
rich compost, and manure-water occasionally. 
Those in flower should be shaded during the 
hottest part of the day. 

Stapelias. — Place these in a hot dry place, 
fully exposed to light ; water regularly, but 
not copiously. Several of them will be in 
flower by the end of the month. When past 
flowering, the supply of moisture should be 
gradually diminished. 

Tropceolums. — Pot any which may show 
signs of grow r th, but do not excite any that are 
at rest. Use a sandy fibrous loam, and leaf 
mould. Water sparingly at first. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature from 60 to 70 degrees by day, 
and from 45 to 50 degrees by night. 

Ventilation.-— Give air copiously in fine 
weather, but close the house eai'ly in the after- 
noon as the evenings get cool. 

Watering. — Apply water with great care 
as the weather gets colder, using it in smaller 
quantities to nearly all plants, and almost 
entirely withholding it from succulents. Sy- 
ringe only in the morning. 

Arrangement, — As many large plants which 
have been out of doors during the summer will 
now require to be housed, attention should be 
paid so to group and arrange them as to 
harmonize in the best way, and to admit of 
the smaller and flowering plants to be placed 
round and among them to the greatest ad- 
vantage. By this means the smaller ones may 
be shifted and re-arranged as often as neces- 
sary, to produce variety, while the tall and 
heavy ones will seldom want to be moved, 
except when a complete change of arrange- 
ment may be desirable. 

General Directions. — Let all plants as they 
are introduced be carefully examined, cleaned, 
surfaced, staked, and re-labelled where neces- 
sary, before they are established in their 
winter quarters. Let all necessary repairs of 
the house be done before the large plants are 
brought in. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature, from 75 to 80 degrees by day, 
and 60 to 65 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Gradually lessen the amount

of air admitted to the bouse, and shut it up 
early in the afternoon. Shading should also 
be gradually dispensed with. 

Watering. — Restrict the amount of Avater, 
especially to plants in a state of rest. Syringe 
most copiously in the morning, gradually 
lessening the amount of moisture as the days 
shorten, and whenever the weather becomes 
cool and cloudy. 

Potting. — Continue to shift such plants as 
require more room, and also to pot any bulbs 
or other roots which may be commencing 
their growth. 

Insects. — Carefully examine the plants, and 
destroy or disturb any insects infesting them. 
Plants in a state of rest are more easily ex- 
amined and cleaned than when growing, es- 
pecially as the insects ai'e then generally not 
in so active a state as at other periods. 

Achimenes. — Late plants should be shifted 
and grown away for winter decoration. Those 
dying down should be gradually dried off, and 
put away in a dry cool place till spring. 

Allamanda, Becmmontia, Echites, and all 
strong growing climbers, should be allowed to 
rest if their growth is completed. Keep them 
properly tied up. 

Alpinias, Hcdycliiums, and other reedy 
plants, as they flower and attain their full 
development, should be well supplied with 
water, but it should be gradually lessened to 
such as have flowered. 

Aphelandras, Justicias, Ruellias, &c. should 
be encouraged where large plants are wanted, 
but to others the supply of water should be 
limited. 

Amaryllids. — Pot any showing signs of 
growth, but prevent their doing so as much as 
possible, by ripening and keeping them in a 
hot dry state after the leaves decay. 

Begonias. — The spring flowering sorts 
should be potted, and gradually excited. 
Water very little until they are growing 
freely, and even then beware of giving too 
much, as they soon suffer from an over supply. 

Burchellias. — Allow the plants to rest as 
they complete their growth. 

Cacti. — Keep these dry and cool, exposed 
to the air, but protected from rough weather. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — -Water 
carefully, reducing the quantity when the 
growth is set. 

Clerodendrons. — Keep those out of bloom 
cool, reducing the supply of moisture, to 
enable them to ripen their wood. 

Climbers. — Tie up and regulate such as 
continue to grow, and water regularly. 

Daturas. — Throw some plants into a state 
of rest by gradually withholding water : by 
doing this at intervals they may be bloomed 
in succession. 

Eryihrinas may be treated in a similar 



way to the last : any that are growing freely 
will require a liberal supply of water. 

Euphorbias. — Gradually reduce the water 
to the succulent sorts, and let them have a 
light airy situation. 

Ferns. — Keep these damp, but reduce the 
supply of moisture as the weather becomes 
cool and cloudy. 

Gardenias. — Pest these as they complete 
their growth, especially such as are wanted 
for early flowering. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Pot and excite 
the winter flowering sorts, and dry off the 
others as they go out of flower. 

Hippeastrums, Crinums, Pancratimns, &c. 
— Water sparingly as they appear to want to 
rest, but always supply enough to keep the 
leaves from flagging. 

Ipooemas. — Such as are in flower will re- 
quire abundance of water, both to the root 
and over the foliage. Cut in such as are 
getting shabby, or rambling too much. 

Ixoras. — Keep them cool as soon as they 
have made their growth ; and limit the supply 
of moisture. 

Jasminums, Rondeletias, Brunfelsias, also 
keep cool and airy. In winter and spring 
they may be flowered at intervals by intro- 
ducing them at different times to more heat 
and moisture. 

Lantanas may be treated in a similar way 
to the last. Pot off cuttings, and get them 
established before winter. 

Luculia gratissima. — Encourage while in 
a growing state, but gradually rest it after- 
wards by withholding water, and keeping it 
cool. 

Lycopodiums. — Keep them not quite so 
damp as formerly, and in a rather more airy 
place as cold or cloudy weather comes on. 

Malvaceous plants, as hibiscus, will require 
liberal supplies of water while in flower : 
guard carefully against insects. 

Manettias, and other tender climbers, 
should be regularly trained, and the supply of 
water at the roots diminished towards the end 
of the month. 

Melastomas. — Supply freely with water 
while in flower, afterwards the quantity 
may be diminished : put in cuttings of desi- 
rable sorts. 

Melo- Cacti. — Reduce the amount of water, 
and place them in a dry, light and airy situ- 
ation, and where they will be rather cool. 

Musas, if showing signs of flowering, should 
be encouraged to set the fruit before the fine 
weather is gone. Apply manure water occa- 
sionally. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher plant). — Less water, 
especially at the roots, should be given, as the 
season advances; keep the plants always in the 
warmest part of the house. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR SEPTEMBER. 



419 



Neriwms may be struck from cuttings, which 
they do very readily in water as well as in 
moist sandy earth. Keep the old plants cool 
and rather dry. 

Nymphmas (Water Lilies). — As the leaves 
show symptoms of decay, the plants should be 
gradually laid dry, or nearly so, and placed in 
a cooler situation for a month or two. 

Palms. — Apply water abundantly to those 
in a growing state ; but reduce it to the 
others. Keep the foliage clean. 

Thunbergias. — Those in flower should be 
plentifully supplied with moisture, and often 
syringed ; keep them neatly trained as they 
advance in growth. 

Vincas. — Plants previously at rest may be 
potted and excited into fresh growth ; they 
will soon flower. Guard against red spider. 
Begin to rest such as have been growing up 
to the present time. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm house for the 
Indian species, 85 degrees by day, 70 degrees 
at night ; the cool, or Mexican house, 75 de- 
grees by day, 60 degrees at night. 

Ventilation. — Give air cautiously, but 
rather freely among such plants as are in a 
state of rest ; close the house early, and 
maintain a proper temperature by increasing 
the artificial heat by means of fires. 

Watering, — Moisture must be applied with 
great caution, and in much smaller quantities 
than when the plants were growing. Syringe 
and damp the flowers chiefly in the morning, 
but sparingly or not at all in dull weather. 

Insects must be allowed no breathing time ; 
while the plants are in a state of rest, they 
can be closely watched for any depredators 
lurking about them. Few of their enemies 
like the drying process to which most of the 
plants will be now subjected. 

Potting. — Renew blocks where necessary 
to such plants whose roots have done growing, 
taking care to disturb or break them as little 
as possible. Most of the others will be better 



left until the period at which they recommence 
their growth. 

Shading. — This may be entirely removed 
from the plants at perfect rest, except in very 
bright sunshine, but continue a slight shade 
over any in a growing state. 

Soils. — Take every opportunity to keep up 
the necessary supply of the various articles 
requisite in this department. Where neces- 
sary for suspending, or for baskets, always use 
copper wire and nails; iron soon rusts and de- 
cays in the damp and heat of this house. 

Imported plants. — As soon as they show 
good symptoms of life, grow them away in 
order to make use of all the sun-heat left. Be 
very careful in the application of water, even 
after they are growing freely. 

Aerides, Saccolabium, and Vanda. — Con- 
tinue to supply these freely with water, and 
keep them in the hottest and dampest part of 
the house. 

Cattleya. — Grow these away," supplying 
them freely with water as they advance in 
growth, but using it very carefully in gloomy 
weather. 

Cymbidiums. — Water freely as long as 
they continue to grow, and afterwards remove 
them to a cooler situation, and reduce the 
allowance of moisture. 

Dendrobiums. — As soon as done growing, 
rest these thoroughly by withholding moisture 
to a great extent, and exposing them to 
bright sun-light, except in the hottest period 
of the day. 

Oncidiums. — As they arrive near their full 
growth the supply of water should be gra- 
dually reduced, and when the growth is com- 
pleted, they should be removed to a cool house, 
and no more moisture applied than merely to 
keep the plants from shrivelling. 

Stanhoj)eas. — Water freely while growing, 

and keep the plants in an airy place. Reduce 

the allowance of water gradually, as they 

complete their growth, and remove them to a 

1 cooler house, where they may enjoy their 

! period of repose.

THE ESCULENT FUNGUSES OF ENGLAND. 



THE ESCULENT FUNGUSES OF ENGLAND.* 

We believe there are very few persons but 
will acknowledge the hand of Providence in 
our late visitation, and hence must admit that, 
without His blessing on our labours, all at- 
tempts to provide a substitute or remedy for 
the failure of the potato crops will avail us 
nothing. The Almighty fiat, however, is not 
that we should remain idle ; but rather that 
we should use every means at our command 
to mitigate the scarcity with which, for some 
good and wise purpose, we have been so lately 
afflicted. 

To abandon, or even neglect, so invaluable 
a crop as the potato, simply because for the 
last two or three years they have in many 
parts of the country partially failed, would be 
next to madness ; for most certainly no ade- 
quate substitute for that vegetable is known, 
nor has any of the articles so recommended 
(by the many advisers upon the subject) the 
slightest pretensions to equality as an article of 
food. "We cannot, therefore, urge too strongly 
upon every farmer, gardener, and private 
gentleman, the necessity and the importance 
of cultivating, year after year, with especial 
care and perseverance, a good breadth of 
potato, notwithstanding all the discourage- 
ments with which it may be attended ; at the 
same time, however, we would have no one 
unmindful of any description of vegetable 
calculated to be useful as an article of food ; 
and, therefore, we hail with pleasure every 
attempt to render available, as sustenance, 
subjects that hitherto have been neglected or 
overlooked. 

The Esculent Fungi may be mentioned a3 
of that class, for, most assuredly, they have 
hitherto been unheeded in this country, al- 
though furnishing food to a very considerable 
extent in various parts of the continent. The 
volume before us comes very opportunely ; 
and upon this matter we will let the author 
speak for himself : — 

" No country is perhaps richer in esculent 
funguses than our own ; we have upwards 
of thirty species abounding in our woods. No 
markets might, therefore, be better supplied 
than the English, and yet England is the only 
country in Europe where this important and 
.savoury food is, from ignorance or prejudice, 
left to perish ungathered. In France, Ger- 
many, and Italy, funguses not only constitute 
for weeks together the sole diet of thousands, 
but the residue, either fresh, dried, or variously

Characters, Development, Structure, Nutritious Pro-

preserved, in oil, vinegar, or brine, is sold by 
the poor, and forms a valuable source of in- 
come to many wdio have no other produce to 
bring into the market. Well then may we 
style them with Mons. Roques, ' the marina of 
the poor /'" — Introd. p. vii. 

In Italy these things are better managed. 
In the markets of Rome many thousand pounds 
weight are annually disposed of; and an in- 
come of many thousand pounds sterling is 
thus derived. 

"The following brief summary was drawn up 
by Professor Sanguinetti, the Official Inspector 
(Ispettore dei Funghi) at Rome : let it speak 
for itself : — ' For forty days during the 
autumn, and for about half that period every 
spring, large quantities of funguses, picked 
in the immediate vicinity of Rome, from 
Frascati, Rocca di Papa, Albano, beyond 
Monte Mario, towards Ostia and the neigh- 
bourhood of the sites of Veii and Gabii, are 
brought in at the different gates. In the year 
1837 the Government instituted the so-called 
Congregazione Speciale di Sanita, which 
among other duties was more particularly re- 
quired to take into serious consideration the 
commerce of funguses, from the unrestricted 
sale of which during some years past, cases of 
poisoning had not unfrequently occurred. The 
following decisions were arrived at by this 
body : — 

" '1st. — That for the future an " Inspector of Funguses," 
versed in botany, should be appointed to attend the 
market in place of the peasant, whose supposed prac- 
tical knowledge had hitherto been held as sufficient 
guarantee for the public safety. 

"'2d.— That all the Funguses brought into Eome by 
the different gates should be registered, under the 
surveillance of the principal Officer, in whose presence 
also the baskets were to be sealed up, and the whole 
for that day's consumption sent under escort to a 
central depot. 

'"3d. — That a certain spot should be fixed upon for 
the Fungus market, and that nobody under penalty 
of fine and imprisonment should hawk them about 
the streets. 

"'4th. — That at seven o'clock, a.m., precisely, the 
Inspector should pay his daily visit, and examine the 
whole, the contents of the baskets being previously 
emptied on the ground by the proprietors, who were 
then to receive, if the Funguses were approved of, 
a printed permission of sale from the police, and to 
pay for it an impost of one baioccho (a halfpenny) on 
every ten pounds. 

"'5th. — That quantities under ten pounds should 
not be taxed. 

"'Gth.— That the stale Funguses of the preceding 
day, as well as those that were mouldy, bruised, filled 
with maggots, or dangerous (muj/i, giia-sli, verminosi, 
velenosi), together with any specimen of the common 
mushroom (Agaricus campetstris) detected in any of 
the baskets, should be sent under escort and thrown 
into the Tiber. 

"'7th. — That the Inspector should be empowered to 
fine or imprison all those refractory to the above regu- 
lations ; and, finally, that he should furnish a weekly 
report to the Tribunal of Provisions (II Trxbuno.lt 
detie Grascie) of the proceeds of the sale.' 



THE ESCULENT FUNGUSES OF ENGLAND. 



421 



" As all fresh funguses for sale in quan- 
tities exceeding ten pounds are weighed, in 
order to be taxed, we are enabled to arrive at 
an exact estimate of the number of pounds 
thus disposed of. The return of taxed Mush- 
rooms in the city of Rome during the last ten 
years, gives a yearly average of between 
sixty and eight)/ thousand pounds weight ; and 
if we double this amount, as we may safely 
do, in order to include such smaller untaxed 
supplies as are disposed of in bribes, fees, and 
presents, and reckon the whole at the rate of 
six baiocchi, or three pence per lb. (a fair 
average), this will make the commercial value 
of fresh funguses very apparent, showing it 
here to be little less than 2,000Z. a year. But 
the fresh funguses form only a small part of 
the whole consumption, to which must be 
added the dried, the pickled, and the pre- 
served ; which sell at a much higher price 
than the first.* Supposing, however, that 
with these additions the supply of all kinds 
only reached a sum the double of that given 
above, even this would furnish us with an 
annual average of nearly four thousand 
pounds sterling ; and this in a single city, and 
that, too, by no means the most populous one 
in Italy ! What then must be the net receipts 
of all the market-places of all the Italian 
States ? For as in these the proportion of the 
price of esculent funguses to butchers' 
meat is as two to three, it is plain, that pre- 
judice has deprived the poor of this country, 
not only of many thousand pounds of the 
former, but also of as much of the latter as 
might have been purchased by exchange, and 
of the countless sums which might have been 
earned in gathering them." — Introd. pp. 
vii.- — x. 

There is no country where fungi do not 
abound, and probably there is in none a lack 
of esculent species. The Russians are some- 
what famed for the number of Fungi which 
they employ as food — about fifty kinds. In 
some parts of Russia the peasantry are said to 
depend on mushrooms and bread for the 
greater part of their sustenance. Our author's 
foreign experience seems to be chiefly Italian ; 
he tells us : — 

"Italy is not the country for the English 
florist ; he will find twenty times as many 
petals at home. Trim parterres are not in- 
ventions of the south ; summer houses would 
be no luxuries in a climate that never 
knows winter ; the only conservatories that 
flourish there are not for flowers, but for 
music. In few northern regions is the 
Goddess of Flowers worse off for a bouquet 
than at Rome or Naples ; regarded merely as

Is. 3d. a pound." 



the herald of spring, and not appreciated for 
her own sake, as soon as she has waved her 
wand over the land and covered it with the 
March blossoms of Crocuses, Cyclamens, and 
Anemones, her reign is over. All scents are 
held in equal abhorrence save those of frank- 
incense and garlic, for which there seems to 
be a prescriptive toleration ; but every other 
odour, fetid or fragrant, musk or mignonette, 
is equally proscribed, and an Italian Signora 
would as soon permit a Locusta to cook for 
her, as a violet to scent her boudoir. To 
pick wild flowers is as dangerous as it is diffi- 
cult to find cultivated ones ; a coup de soleil 
or a fever is easily pi-ocured by imprudent 
exposure before sunset, while the interval 
between that and night is too brief to be em- 
ployed for the. purpose ; but when the season 
for flowers is long passed, and autumn with 
her fruits is come round again, when the 
stranger can wander forth where he lists 
without an umbrella, he will be able to luxu- 
riate amidst the lonely scenery, and to delight 
himself in the natural history of the district ; 
the season of the periodical rains has ceased ; 
the repose of the forest is no longer troubled 
by the power of the waters ; the mountain 
pines borne for miles down into the valleys 
are stranded on the broad shingly bed of the 
exhausted torrent ; broken bridges are safely 
repaired ; the maize is receiving the last 
mellowing touches as it festoons the cottage 
fronts, the prickly chestnut pods are beginning 
to gape and the brown chestnuts to leap out 
shining from their envelopes ; the last reluc- 
tant olive has been beaten from the bough ; 
the vintage has nearly ceased to bleed, night 
fires* already begin to flicker on the moun- 
tains, and the hemp stubble is daily crackling 
on the plain ; this is indeed the time for en- 
joying Italy ; nature has revived again, and 
with nature, man. The feverish torpor, I 
had almost ventured to call it the summer 
hybernation, has ceased with September, and 
autumn has come round with the vivifying 
influence of a new spring ; then if we go 
abroad to wander, whether our walk be across 
plains or through upland woods, we shall not 
stroll a mile without stopping a hundred times 
to admire what is to many of us a nearly new 
class of objects which have sprung up sud- 
denly and now beset our path on every side. 
These are the fungus tribe, which are as 
beautiful as the fairest flowers, and more 
useful than most fruits ; and now that but- 
chers' meat is bad, that the beans have

become stringy, and the potatoes are hydrated 
by the rain, they appear thus opportunely to 
eke out the scantiness of autumnal larders in 
the south, and give a fresh zest to the daily 
repast. "Well may their sudden apparition 
surprise us, for not ten days since the waters 
were all out, and only three or four nights 
back peals of thunder rattled against the 
casements and kept the most determined 
sleepers in awful vigil ; and now, behold the 
meadows by natural magic studded with 
countless fairy rings of every diameter, 
formed of such species as grow upon the 
ground, while the chestnut and the oak are 
teeming with a new class of fruits that had 
no previous blossoming, many of which have 
already attained their full growth. We recol- 
lect with gratitude the objects of a pursuit, 
which has accidentally brought us to such an 
acquaintance with the diversities of Italian 
scenery, as we never should have experienced 
without it. In fishing it is not the fish we 
catch which alone repays us for our toil ; it 
is the wandering as the rivulet wanders, ' at 
its own sweet will,' the exercise and the 
appetite consequent upon it, the prize in 
natural history, the reciting aloud, or reflect- 
ing as we walk, and when it is pleasantly 
warm the 'molles sub arbore somni,' which 
console us for the lack of sport ; on the same 
principle mushroom-hunting may be recom- 
mended to the young naturalist, not only for 
the beauty of the objects which he is sure to 
come upon (if he do but hunt at the right 
season), but also because in that most beau- 
tiful of months, whether at home or abroad, 
it brings the wanderer out of beaten paths to 
fall in with many striking views which he 
would not otherwise have explored. The ex- 
tremely limited time during which funguses 
are to be found, their fragility, their infinite 
diversity, their ephemeral existence, these, 
too, add to the interest of an autumnal walk 
in quest of them. At Lucca, leaving idleness 
and indigestion in bed, just as the sun was 
beginning to shoot his first rays on the white 
convents, and the spires of the village churches 
on the mountains, making morning above, 
while the deep valley beneath was still in twi- 
light, it was pleasant to pass the little opening 
coffee-house with its two or three candidates 
for early breakfast, and crossing the noiseless 
trout stream over the little bridge, to enter 
one of those old chestnut forests and begin 
clambering up the laddery pathway, to reach 
the summit just as he poured his full efful- 
gence on the magnificent rival views of the 
Lucchese and Modenese territories ; pleasant 
too was it on the road Rome-ward, pausing a 
few days to enjoy the exquisite scenery about 
Spoleto, to climb the steep streets to the 
cathedral, and thence passing the giddy via- 



duct several hundred feet above the white 
ravine, which it traverses, to issue upon those 
Nurcian Hills then fragrant with the breath 
of morning, ' le beau matin qui sort humide 
et pale,' and with the scent of sweet herbs ; 
but above all other hills renowned for the 
fragrance of those ever reproductive mines of 
coal-black, subterranean truffles ! It is a plea- 
sant remembrance to have plucked the crimson 
Amanite that ministered to a Caesar's decease 
in the very neighbourhood of the Palatine 
Hill ; to have collected mushrooms amidst the 
meadows of Horace's farm, where he tells us 
they grew best, and to have watched along 
the moist pastures of the Cremara a stand of 
the stately Agaricus procerus nodding upon 
their stalks ; or standing on the heights above 
Sorrento, just as the setting sun flashed upon 
the waters of the bay ere they engulphed 
him, and left us to his sister and the evening 
star, to have come upon that wonderful 
Polyporus tuberaster, whose matrix is the 
hard stone, from which it derives strength and 
luxuriance as if from a soft and genial soil. 

" But not only in Italy, in our own country 
also, the collector in Mycology will have to 
traverse much beautiful and diversified scenery; 
amid woods, greenswards, winding lanes, rich 
meadows, healthy commons, open downs, the 
nodding hop-grove, and the mountain sheep- 
path ; and all shone upon by an autumnal 
sunset, as compai'ed Avith southern climes 
' obscurely bright,' and unpreceded by that 
beautiful rosy tint which bathes the whole 
landscape in Italy, but with a far finer back 
ground of clouds to reflect its departed 
glories ; and throughout all this range of 
scenery he will never hunt in vain ; indulgent 
gamekeepers made aware of what he is poach- 
ing may warn him that he is not collecting 
mushrooms, but will never warn him off from 
the best kept preserves. In such rambles he 
will see, what I have this autumn myself 
witnessed, whole hundred weights of rich 
wholesome diet rotting under trees; woods 
teeming with food and not one hand to gather 
it ; and this perhaps in the midst of potato 
blight, poverty and all manner of privations, 
and public prayers against imminent famine. 
I have indeed grieved when I reflected on the 
straitened condition of the lower orders this 
year, to see pounds innumerable of extempore 
beef-steaks growing on our oaks in the shape 
of Fistulina hepatica ; Agaricus fusipes, to 
pickle, in clusters under them ; Puff-balls, 
which some of our friends have not inaptly 
compared to sweetbread for the rich delicacy 
of their unassisted flavour ; Hydna, as good 
as oysters, which they somewhat resemble in 
taste; Agaricus deliciosus, reminding us of 
tender lamb-kidneys ; the beautiful yellow 
Chantarelle, that halon hagothon of diet, grow-

ing by the bushel, and no basket but our own 
to pick up a few specimens in our way ; the 
sweet nutty-flavoured Boletus, in vain calling 
himself edulis where there was none to believe 
him ; the dainty Orcella ; the Agaricus hete- 
ropliyllus, which tastes like the craw -fish when 
grilled ; the Agaricus ruber and 'Agaricus 
virescens, to cook in any way, and equally 
good in all ; — these were among the most 
conspicuous of the trouvailles ; but that the 
reader may know all he is likely to find in one 
single autumn let him glance at the catalogue 
below.* He may at first alarm his friends' 
cooks, but their fears will, I promise him, 
soon be appeased, after one or two trials of 
this new class of viands, and he will not long 
pass either for a conjuror, or something worse, 
ii» giving directions to stew toadstools; as 
soon as he is initiated in this class of dainties 
he will, I am persuaded, lose no time in 
making the discovery known to the poor of 
the neighbourhood ; while in so doing he will 
render an important service to the country at 
large, by instructing the indigent and igno- 
rant in the choice of an ample, wholesome, 
and excellent article, which they may convert 
into money, or consume at their own tables, 
when properly prepared, throughout the 
winter."— Pp. 133—137. 

After treating on the range of fungus 
growths, of their general forms, colours, tex- 
tures, odours, and tastes, the expansive power 
of their growth, their reproductive power, 
motion, phosphorescence, dimensions, che- 
mical composition,' uses, and development, 
Dr. Eadham goes on to describe the following 
as wholesome species : — 

Agaricus prunulus, Ag. procerus, Boletus 
edtdis, Ag. campestris, Ag. exquisitus, Ag. 
deliciosus, Boletus scaber, Ag. persotiatus, 
Ag. Oreades, Ag. nebularis, Cantharellus 
cibarius, Ag. atramentarius, Ag. comatus, 
Ag. heteropliyllus, Ag. ruber, Ag. virescens, 
Ag. ostreatus, Ag. rubescens, Morckellia 
esculenta, BTydnum repandum, Fistulina 
hepatica, Ag. orcella, BZelvella crispa, Bl. 
lacunosa, Verpa digitaliformis, Peziza ace- 
tabulum, Polyporus tuberaster, P. fron- 
drosus, Clavaria coralloides, Lycoperdon 



* " The whole of the species mentioned in the 
annexed list were met with by the author this summer 
and autumn, (1846,) and partaken of by himself and 
friends, viz: — Amanita vaginata; Ag. rubescens, 
procerus, prunulus, ruber, heteropliyllus, virescens, 
deliciosus, nebularis, personatus, virgineus, fusipes, 
Oreades, ostreatus, orcella, campestris, (and its varie- 
ties edulis and pratensis), exquisitus, comatus, and 
idmarius ; Cantharellus cibarius ; Polyporus fron- 
dosus ; Boletus edulis and scaber; Fistulina hepatica; 
Hydnum repandum; Helvetia lacunosa; Peziza 
acetabulum and Bovista plumbea ; Lycoperdon gem- 
mafum and Clavaria strigosa' y 



plumbeum, L. bovista, Ag. melleus (nauseous), 
Ag. ulmarius, Ag. fusifes, Ag. vaginatus, 
Ag. violaceus, Ag. castaneus, Ag. piperatus, 
Ag. virgineus ; of these the Agaricus cam- 
pestris (common Mushroom) and MorchelUa 
esculenta (Morel) are the only ones in com- 
mon use. 

Regarding fungi as an article of diet, and 
the modes of distinguishing the wholesome 
from the poisonous species, we find the 
following remarks : — 

" That the mushroom is not quite so whole- 
some when cultivated, as it is in the meadow 
in a state of nature, cannot be doubted .;* and 
that many persons have suffered both in 
France and England, more or less, gastric 
disturbance after eating those taken from hot- 
beds, or from dark foul unaerated places, is 
certain ; that mushrooms also in decay, when 
chemistry has laid hold of their tissues and 
changed their juices, have produced disagree- 
able sensations in the stomach and bowels, is 
not to be questioned ; finally, that the idiosyn- 
cracy of some persons is opposed to this diet, 
as that of others is to shell-fish, to melons, 
cucumbers, and the like, must also be ceded ; 
but none of these admissions surely meddle 
with the question, nor go any way towards 
proving the assumed fact, viz : — that a mush- 
room ever changes its nature and becomes 
poisonous like the toadstool. f It has been 
unwarily asserted, that because the people of 
the north are in the habit of employing in 
their kitchen the Agaricus muscarius, which 
is known to be poisonous in the south, that 
this points to some remarkable difference in 
the plant, depending on difference of locality. 
It is to be recollected, however, that this very 
same fungus if taken, in sufficient quantity, 
without the precaution usually adopted of 
soaking it in vinegar before cooking, has pro- 
duced fatal accidents, of which we read the 
recitals in various mycological works ; and 
only not more frequently, because the plant 
being generally well steeped in brine or acetic 
acid, is in most cases robbed of deleterious 



" " Locality has a great effect upon almost all that 
we eat : our very mutton varies in different counties ; 
compare the town-bred gutter-fed poultry of London, 
with that of twenty miles around ; fish vary, the tench 
out of different ponds are different ; fruits vary with 
the soil ; are potatoes everywhere the same 1" 

f " Persons have fancied themselves poisoned when 
they were not ; indigestion produced by mushrooms 
is looked upon with fear and suspicion, and if a medi- 
cal man be called in, the stomach-pump used, and 
relief obtained by its rejection, nothing will persuade 
either patient or practitioner that this has not been a 
case of poisoning. ' You have saved my life/ says 
the one. ' I think you will not be persuaded to eat 
any more mushrooms for some time,' says the other : 
and so they part ; each under the impression that he 
knows more about mushrooms than any body else can 
tell him."'

THE ESCULENT FUNGUSES OF ENGLAND. 



principles, the only residue left being pure 
fungine, which is equally innoxious, and the 
same in all funguses whatever. It is, more- 
over, worthy of remark, that though the com- 
mon mushroom (Agaricus campestris) varies 
considerably, both as to flavour and whole- 
someness (circumstances attributable in part 
to the varieties of soil in which it flourishes ;*) 
other funguses, on the contrary, being mostly 
restricted for their alimentation and re- pro- 
duction to some one particular habitat, do not 
present such differences. The Boletus cdulis, 
the Fistulina hepatica, the Agaricus Oreades, 
the Agaricus procerus, the Agaricus pru- 
nulus, the Agaricus fusipes, the Cantharellus 
cibarius, &c, are in flavour, and other sen- 
sible qualities, just the same in England as 
they are in France, Switzerland, or Italy. 
Thus the objection to eat funguses on the 
ground of their presenting differences depend- 
ing on those of the locality where they grow, 
applies principally, if it apply at all, to the 
English mushroom, of which no housekeeper 
is afraid, and by no means to those species, 
the introduction of which into our markets 
and kitchens forms the main object of this 
treatise. 

"Besides the foregoing objections to fun- 
guses on the general ground of their supposed 
indigestibility, or else the more particular one 
of their not being at all times and in all 
places the same, a further and weightier one, 
as it is commonly urged, is the alleged impos- 
sibility of our being able to discriminate with 
certainty the good from the bad ; an objection 
which derives much of its supposed weight 
from the apparently clashing testimonies of 
authors respecting the same species, who not 
unfrequently describe, under a common name, 
a fungus which some of them assert to be 
esculent, some doubtful, and others, altogether 
poisonous in its qualities. Such discrepan- 
cies, however, have already in many cases 
been satisfactorily adjusted, whilst a more 
minute attention and corresponding improve- 
ment in the pictorial representation of species 
is daily diminishing the errors of the older 
mycologists. Admitting then, what there is 
no gainsaying, the existence of many dan- 
gei'ous individuals in this family, f ought we 
not in a matter of such importance rather to 
apply ourselves to the task of discriminating 
them accurately, than permit idle rumours of 
its impracticability, or even its real difficulty 

* " It grows not only throughout Europe, but in 
India also." 

f " We should apply the same rales of discrimination 
here as elsewhere ; have we not picked potatoes for 
our table out of the deadly family of Solatia ? selected 
with care the garden from the fool's parsley? and do 
we not pickle gherkins, notwithstanding their affinity 
to the E/aterium momordicum, which would poison 
us if we wore to eat it V 



to dehort us from the undertaking ? Assur- 
edly nature, who has given to brutes an in- 
stinct, by which to select their aliment, has 
not left man without a discriminative power 
to do the same, with equal certainty ; nor does 
he use his privileges to their full, or employ 
his senses as he might, when he suffers him- 
self to be surpassed by brute animals, in their 
diagnosis of food. 

" The first thing to know about funguses 
is, that in the immense majority of cases, 
they are harmless ; the innoxious and esculent 
kinds are the rule, the poisonous the excep- 
tions to it ; in a general way, it is more easy 
to say what we should not eat, than what we 
may ; we should never eat any that smell 
sickly or poisonous. Opinions respecting the 
agreeableness or disagreeableness of an odour, 
as of a taste, may differ ; thus, in France and 
Italy (where the palate seems to us to bribe 
the judgment of the nose), it is usual to speak 
of that of the Agaricus prunidus as ' perfum- 
ing the air ;' but though the strong peculiar 
smell exhaled by this and some other esculent 
funguses, be anything but a perfume, as we 
apprehend the term, it is very different from 
that intolerable foetor, that nauseous over- 
whelming odour given out by the Phallus 
impudicus, the Clathrus cancellatus, the 
Amanita verna, and its varieties. There are 
some, indeed, which, yielding no smell, will 
poison notwithstanding ; but then there are 
none to lure us into a false security by a 
deceitful fragrance. The same negative indi- 
cations are furnished by the palate as by the 
nose ; those that are bitter, or styptic, or that 
burn the fauces on mastication, or that parch 
the throat when they have been swallowed, 
should be put aside ; those that yield spiced 
milk, of whatever colour, should be held, 
notwithstanding exceptions, in suspicion, as 
an unsafe dairy to deal with. The 'Lucchese 
Goat' {Agaricus piperatus), and the ' Cow of 
the Vosges' (Agaricus lactifluus aureus), 
though in high request ;in their respective 
localities, and really delicate themselves, are 
akin to others whose milks, though they may 
have the colour of gold, have the qualities of 
gamboge. Paulet was once so indiscreet as to 
eat a slice of the Griper (Agaricus tormi- 
nosus), which belongs to this genus, and after- 
wards still more indiscreet in giving it the 
inviting name of ' Mouton zone / it is well, 
however, that the reader should be apprized, 
as he will frequently come across this i Moutori 
in his walks, that it is a perfect wolf in 
sheep's clothing, nor less to be avoided than 
one nearly allied to it, which rejoices in the 
name of Necator, or the Slayer. Here, as it 
is a safe rule, rather to condemn many that 
may be innocent, than to admit one that is at 
all suspicious to our confidence, we should,

till intimacy lias made us familiar with the 
exceptions, avoid all those the flesh of which 
is livid, or that, Chameleon-like, assume a 
variety of hues on being broken or bruised.* 
The external colour furnishes no certain in- 
formation, with the single exception of that 
of the gills in one or two Agarics, by which 
to know the good from the bad ; thus the 
Boule de neige, and the Vernal amanite, are 
both white, but the dress, in one case, is of 
innocence, in the other of mere hypocrisy ; 
again, the green, which we are so cautioned 
to avoid in this class of plants as cholorotic 
and unhealthy, and which is of such bad 
augury in Amanita viridis, is quite the con- 
trary in the Verdette (A. virescens). So that 
to be led only by colour would certainly be to 
be misled, a mistake which, in the family of 
the Mtissulce, might readily compromise life. 

" Some mycologists recommend, with cer- 
tain exceptions, the avoidance of such Agarics 
as have lateral stalks, of such as are pectinate 
(i. e. have equal gills like a comb), of such as 
have little flesh in proportion to the depth of 
their gills, and generally of all those that are 
past their prime. Some warn us not to eat 
after the snail, as we are in the habit of doing 
in our gardens after the wasp ; we may trust 
it seems to him to point out the best green- 
gages, but not to the slug to select our mush- 
rooms for us. Finally, it has been very 
currently affirmed, though I think without 
sufficient warrant, that all such funguses as 
run rapidly into deliquescence ought to be 
avoided as dangerous. Here, while it might 
be unsafe to lay down any positive rule 
beyond one's own experience, this, so far as 
it goes, would rather lead me to a different 
inference ; and even the reader will ask, 
* Does not the mushroom deliquesce, and is not 
ketchup, that poignant liquor made from 
boiled mushrooms mixed with salt to which 
we are all so partial, this very deliquescence ?' 
but, besides this, the Agaricas comatus, which 
is highly deliquescent, is largely eaten about 
Lucca, the Agaricus atramentarius also is, 
on our own authority, as good for ketchup as 
for that purpose to which its juices are more 
commonly put, viz : — for making ink ; thus 
amongst deliquescent Agarics, there are some 
the juices of which are both safe and savoury, 
perhaps of more than those here recorded, 
but as I have not hitherto myself made trial 
of any others, and as there are some danger- 

* " The converse of this remark by no means holds 
true; the A manita verna, the Am. Phalloides, the 
Ag. semiglobatus, Dryophilus, and muscarius, though 
amongst the most deadly of this class of plants, do not 
change colour on being cut ; the flesh of the first two 
is moreover of a tempting -whiteness, like that of the 
common puff-ball, than which there is not a safer or a 
better fungus." 



ous species mixed up with this group, the 
public cannot be too much cautioned against 
making any rash experiment, where the con- 
sequences of a mistake might be so serious. 

" Some trees give origin by preference to 
good, others to deleterious species ; thus, the 
hazel-nut, the black and perhaps the white 
poplar, together with the fig-tree, grow only 
good sorts ; whereas the olive has been famous 
since the clays of Nicander for none but poi- 
sonous species. The elm, the alder, the larch, 
the beech, and some other trees, seem capable 
of supporting both good and bad species at 
their roots, hence it is not safe to trust impli- 
citly to the tree to determine the wholesome- 
ness or unwholesomeness of the fungus that 
grows out of it, or in its neighbourhood. The 
presence of a free acid is by no means con- 
clusive either way, there being many species 
of both good and bad which will indifferently 
turn litmus paper red. The old and very . 
general practice adopted by cooks of dressing 
funguses with a silver spoon, (which is sup- 
posed to become tarnished, then, only when 
their juices are of a deleterious quality,) is an 
error which cannot be too generally known 
and exposed, as many lives, especially on the 
Continent, have been and still are sacrificed to 
it annually. In some cases, the kitchen fire 
will extract the deleterious property from 
funguses, which it would have been unsafe to 
eat raw — and frequently the acrid lactescent 
kinds change their nature entirely and become 
mild by cooking ; in other cases, the virus is 
drawn out by saturating the fungus, some 
time before dressing it, either in vinegar or 
brine,* the liquid then containing the poison 
which was originally in the plant ; but in 
other species, as in Ag. emeticus, it would 
seem from the experiments of M. Krapf, 
of Vienna, upon living animals, that it is 
to be extracted neither by ebullition nor 
desiccation." f— Pp. 32—38. 

The expansive power of the growth of 
fungi is very great, and will appear more 
especially so if we take into consideration the 
softness and succulency of their texture ; in 
fact, in the work of disintegration, the fungi 
must bear an important part. 

" Soft and yielding as vegetable structures 
appear to the touch, the expansive force of 
their growth is almost beyond calculation ; 
the effects of this power, of which the expe- 
rience of every one will furnish him with 



* " As was known to the Gi-eeks, ' Prepare your 
funguses with vinegar, salt, or honey, for thus you 
will rob them of their poison: — Svtu -yap avrccv to 
TTViyvoiSes acpouptirai.' " 

f " Vittadini, however, ate largely of this fungus, 
which he describes as very disagreeable, though it did 
not prove poisonous to him."

some instances, are, perhaps, nowhere more 
strikingly exemplified than amidst the ruins of 
its own creation. Coeval with many old brick 
fabrics of earlier times, perhaps imbedded in 
the very mortar w T hich holds them together, 
it may lurk there for centuries in quiescence, 
till once arousing its energies, it continues to 
exert them in ceaseless activity ever after. 
It has at Koine planted its pink Valerians on 
her highest towers, and its wild fig-tree in the 
breaches of her walls ; nor are the granite 
obelisks of her piazzas, nor the classic groups 
in marble on her Quirinal mount, entirely 
exempt from its encroachments ; a conspiracy 
of plants, one hundred strong, have long ago 
planned the destruction of the Colosseum ; 
their undermining process advances each year, 
and neither iron nor new brick-work can arrest 
it long ; that old Roman cement, which the 
Barbarians gave up as impracticable, and the 
pick-axe of the Barberini had but begun to 
disintegrate, will, ere the lapse of another 
century, be effectually pulled to pieces by the 
rending arm of vegetation. Here, as erst in 
Juvenal's time, the Malaficus finds no walls 
too strong to rive asunder ; no tower beyond 
the reach of its scaling ; no monument too 
sacred for it to touch. In the class of plants 
immediately under consideration, while the 
expansive effort of growth is equal to what it 
is in other cases, its effects are far more 
startling from their suddenness. Mons. 
Bulliard (to cite one or two instances out of a 
great many) relates, that on placing a Phallus 
impudicus within a glass vessel, the plant ex- 
panded so rapidly, as to shiver its sides with 
an explosive detonation, as loud as that of a 
pistol. Dr. Carpenter, in his Elements of 
Physiology, mentions that, ' in the neigh- 
bourhood of Basingstoke, a paving-stone, 
measuring twenty-one inches square, and 
weighing eighty-three pounds, was completely 
raised an inch and a half out of its bed, by a 
mass of toadstools, of from six to seven inches 
in diameter, and that nearly the whole pave- 
ment of the town suffered displacement from 
the same cause.' A friend has seen a crop of 
puff-balls raise large flag-stones considerably 
above the plane of their original level ; and I 
have myself recently witnessed an extensive 
displacement of the pegs of a wooden pave- 
ment, which had been driven nine inches into 
the ground, but were heaved up irregularly, 
in several places, by small bouquets of Agarics, 
growing from below. 

" Most funguses do not present great ano- 
malies in their size, but retain nearly the same 
dimensions throughout the whole course of 
their being ; some few species, however, seem 
to have a faculty of almost indefinite expan- 
sion. The usual size of a puff-ball, as we all 
know, is not much larger than an egg, but 



some puff-balls attain to the dimensions of the 
human head, or exceed it. Mr. Berkeley 
quotes the case of a Polyporus squamosus, 
which in three weeks grew to seven feet five 
inches in periphery, and weighed thirty-four 
pounds ; also of a Polyporus fraxineus, 
which in a few years measured forty-two 
inches across. Clusius tells us of a fungus in 
Pannonia, of such immense size, that after 
satisfying the cravings of a large mycophilous 
household, enough of it remained to fill a 
chariot ; this must have been the Polyporus 
frondosus, to which Polyporus John Bapt. 
Porta also alludes, as that called gallinace,* 
by the Neapolitans, which is so big, he says, 
that you can scarcely make your hands meet 
round it ; he had known it attain twelve 
pounds weight in a few days.f Bolton, in 
1787, found an Agaricus muscarius, which, 
' after the removal of a considerable portion 
of its stalk, weighed nearly two pounds ;' 
Withering, an Agaricus Georgii, ' which 
weighed fourteen pounds,' and Mr. Stackhouse 
another of the same species in Cornwall, 
' which was eighteen inches across, and had a 
stem as thick as a man's wrist ;' and I lately 
picked in the park at Buckhurst, a Boletus 
edulis, which measured twenty-eight inches 
round its pileus, and eight round the stem, 
and a few days later a Boletus pachypus, the 
girth of which was thirty-two inches." — Pp. 
12—14, 16, 17. 

We cannot forbear quoting a forcible pas- 
sage relating to the now almost universally 
exploded — and perhaps we might add, impi- 
ous — doctrine of spontaneous, or, as it is 
sometimes modified, equivocal generation, in 
the maintenance of which doctrine, the fungi 
have often been called in requisition : — 

" It would be an insult to the reader's un- 
derstanding, and a most idle waste of his time, 
to attempt to confute such self-destroying 
dogmas as those of ' spontaneous,' or of 
'equivocal generation,' which last is only a 
clumsy equivoque expressive of the same 
thing ; we might just as well talk of the pen- 
dulum of a clock generating the time and 
space in which it librated, as of dead matter 
spontaneously quickening and actuating those 
new movements of which some of its particles 
have become the seat ; for how, in the name 
of common sense, can that which we assume 

* "By this word, however, the vulgar generally 
understood the Cantharcllus cibarius." 

f "This species, which is somewhat rare in England, 
occurred in abundance this year in the neighbourhood 
of Tonbridge Wells. I found four specimens of it on 
the oak roots in the Grove, one of which rose nearly 
a foot from the ground, measured considerably more 
than two and a half feet across, and weighed from 
eighteen to twenty pounds ; the other specimens were 
of much smaller dimensions."

to be dead, i. e. emphatically and totally 
without life, convey such purely vital pheno- 
mena as those of intus-susception and growth, 
which by the very supposition, are no longer 
within itself. Life, on such an hypothesis as 
this, ceases to be the opposite and antagonist 
principle to death, of which it then becomes 
but a different mode and a new phasis. It is 
not the incomprehensibility of such a notion 
(be it well understood) against which the ob- 
jection lies, for, as life begins and ends in 
mystery, that would be no objection ; it lies 
in the rashness of attempting to solve an 
admitted mystery, by placing a palpable ab- 
surdity in its room ; vainly and irreverently 
arrogating to itself the honours of a discovery, 
which we are to believe if we can ! At this 
rate, addled eggs, abandoned by the vital 
principle, might take to hatching themselves ! 
A more legitimate, and very interesting sub- 
ject for inquiry is, whether those funguses 
which are parasitical, (i. e. derive their sup- 
port from the structures whence they ema- 
nate,) are so many separate constituents of a 
superior life under analysis; or each, of itself, 
a new individual ? In support of the first 
view it is urged, that since reproduction in 
such lower existences is nothing but a modi- 
fication of nutrition, a new process might well 
originate from its perversion, and thus give 
rise to new products ; and just as the change 
in the ordinary nutrition of our bodily organs 
is prone to give birth to various local disor- 
ganizations, or morbid growths ; such, it 
is argued, might be the origin of fungoid 
growths on trees. But then comes the diffi- 
culty: such a view does not, and plainly 
cannot, explain the development of the not 
parasitical kinds, of which the origin should 
be the same ; no, nor even of all that live by 
suction at the expense of other plants, since 
there are as many kinds which quicken in dead 
and decaying structures, as there are that 
issue out of decrepit and living ones ; here 
then it is plain that perverted nutrition can 
have nothing to do with their production, for 
in this case nutrition has, by the supposition, 
ceased; and to talk of disease after death 
would be a strange figure of speech indeed ! 
An elm or oak is frequently dead five, seldom 
less than three, years before these parasitical 
growths make their appearance ; from which 
it would appear to follow that seeds are not 
developed by, but that they must be extrane 
ous to, and independent of, any pathological 
relation of the plant from which they grow. 
If then, fungus life be not to be sought for, 
and cannot with propriety be said to originate 
in any morbid conditions of the tissues from 
which they spring, whence do they derive 
life ? in other words, whence in every instance 
comes that particular seed which, when quick- 



ened, is to produce after its kind ? Lies this 
dormant for a season in those dead and decay- 
ing tissues, which a little later the plant 
originating from it is destined to embellish ? 
or is the living germ first brought to them by 
the winds, and merely deposited on their sur- 
face, as in a fitting nidus on which their future 
development is to be effected ? Some writers 
take one view, some another. Many believe 
the seeds of funguses to come directly from 
the earth, and to be drawn up with the sap, 
which as it penetrates throughout the tissues 
of the plant, must carry the seeds also along 
with it ; that such is actually sometimes the 
case is certain, since we can not only plant 
parasitical blights of a particular kind, so as 
to infect particular plants, but may also, by 
digging a trench between those that have 
already become diseased, and those that are 
still healthy, stay the progress of the blight ; 
thus clearly establishing, not only the fact of 
seeds, but also the highly interesting addi- 
tional one, of their ascent into the structures 
of plants by intus-susception ; and to arrive 
at a general view from these particular cases, 
this would seem to be the usual mode of their 
propagation ; neither does it make against this 
view, nor is it more in favour of the other, 
which supposes the germs to be derived pri- 
marily from the air, and to be thence precipi- 
tated on the structures where they grow, that 
funguses are found on organizations in decay, 
on withered boughs, and on seared leaves, out 
of which all sap must of course have been 
long ago exsiccated ; for what then ? though 
the sap does, the seeds do not evaporate with 
it ; these, once absorbed and diffused during 
the life-time of the plant throughout its whole 
economy, remain there, in a state of potential 
activity, ready to burst forth and germinate 
whenever the necessary conditions for these 
wonderful changes shall be presented to them, 
just as though the seeds of corn now flourish- 
ing in different parts of England, had first 
existed for some thousand years as mummy 
wheat, potentially and unquickened. Nothing 
perishes in nature : destructio unius matrix 
alterius : life may change titles, but never 
becomes extinct ; so soon as the more perfect 
plant dies, a host of other vegetable existences, 
hitherto enthralled by laws of an organization 
superior to their own, now that the connexion 
has been dissevered, put forth their separate 
energies, and severally assert their indepen- 
dence ; the poplar may have perished — root, 
stem, and branch, but its extinction is only 
the signal for other existences, which had 
been heretofore bound up and hid within its 
own, to assert themselves ; and accordingly a 
JPolyporus sprouts out here ; there a Thele- 
plwra embellishes the dead bark ; and here 
an Agaric springs out of the decaying fibres

of its head ; these in turn also decay, but as 
they moulder away they languish into a new 
kind of fungous life, of an inferior type to 
the last, as if their own vitality were inferior 
in kind to that of the decayed poplar, whence 
they lately issued.* Thus, since the seeds of 
funguses actually exist in great quantity in 
other plants, and since they occur in the 
closed interior of fruits, and in corollas which 
are still in their envelopes, (in either case out 
of the reach of the external air.) since, 
finally, the Pietra fungliaia, which produces 
a Polyporus unknown to England, may be, 
notwithstanding, made to germinate in Eng- 
land, by furnishing the stone with adequate 
supplies of water and of heat, that seems the 
more tenable hypothesis of the two, which in 
every case supposes the nidus of the fungus 
to furnish the seed, and the atmosphere the 
conditions necessary for its quickening." —

We have to express our satisfaction at the 
appearance of this work at the present junc- 
ture, and most readily bestow on it a deserved 
general commendation. We must not, how- 
ever, be blind to its demerits. First of all, 
we are totally unable to conceive how, in a 
work expressly devoted to an account of the 
esculent funguses of England, the truffle — 
that daintiest of fungoid dainties — comes to 
be altogether omitted ; yet such is the case ; 
it is neither represented, described, nor cata- 
logued. We must also venture to think, that 
the style of the work falls exactly into that 
medium position, which, in botanical matters 
at least, can never be a " happy" one. The 
text is, we fear, not botanical enough nor 
orderly enough to please a botanist, and to 
render the work acceptable to him ; and we 
imagine it is, to a great extent at least, much 
too botanical for the general reader. In these 
days, too, we should have preferred to have 
seen the plates arranged with more regard to 
botanical order. The author's estimate of 
their value, as esculents, which appears now 
to be the leading feature of arrangement, would 
have been much better indicated in a tabular 
form. However, these defects of the work 
are in a great measure counterbalanced by the 
beautiful manner in which it is printed on 
super-royal octavo ; and by the beauty and 
general accuracy of the illustrations. The 

* " Just as in the inorganic world chemical analysis 
is frequently the precursor of new forms of matter, 
resulting from the new affinities which take place ; so 
when a vegetable dies, and the synthesis of its struc- 
tural arrangement is broken up, Nature frequently 
avails herself of this season of decomposition, to bring 
new individuals out of the decaying structures of the 
old ; which, in consequence of a beautiful pre-arrange- 
ment, find there all the requisite supplies for their 
tb and future maintenance." 



latter consist of twenty-one plates ; sixteen 
of these are exquisitely coloured, and contain 
representations of thirty-seven species, and 
some varieties of fungi, wholesome and dele- 
terious, but chiefly the former ; and the 
remainder are occupied by the details of the 
structure of these curious and interesting 
plants. 

GARDENERS, AND THE CULTURE OF 
FLORISTS' FLOWERS. 

There is scarcely any branch of gardening 
so little attended to in large establishments as 
the cultivation of florists' flowers : and with- 
out any disrespect to the many skilful gardeners 
who must be included in our censure, there is 
scarcely any point in practice so little under- 
stood. Many a gardener who is equal to 
every department of forcing, and fruit and 
vegetable growing, is, nevertheless, very de- 
ficient in his knowledge of those subjects 
which have by dint of high culture been drawn 
out of their natural and simple- state into 
objects of great beauty and delicacy. Such 
flowers as the tulip, the hyacinth, the picotee, 
carnation, pink, pansy or heartsease, ranun- 
culus, dahlia, rose, fuchsia, geranium, and 
some others, have been so improved as to 
render their original species poor and worth- 
less by comparison. Some of these, which 
require only the same culture as the most 
common, may be grown and are grown, as a 
matter of course, in all establishments. The 
rose, dahlia, geranium, fuchsia, and hyacinth, 
are everybody's flowers, and the most beau- 
tiful are no more difficult to grow than the 
most common ; but tulips, auriculas, ranun- 
culuses, pinks, picotees, and carnations, 
require very peculiar treatment ; and as not 
one good gardener in ten knows how to cul- 
tivate them, they never try to obtain them. 
There may be some excuse for this ; they oc- 
cupy a great deal of time, and give a good 
deal of trouble, and they are not things to 
trust to other men. Still we recommend all 
gardeners to be acquainted with them, and to 
procure a few and manage them according to 
the published directions, that they may be 
prepared for growing them when any change 
renders it necessary. There is good reason to 
know that the absence of certain qualifications 
is often fatal when searching for a new place ; 
and though a man may fancy himself in a 
place for life, changes take place in families 
when it is least expected ; the death of an 
employer often changes the whole aspect of 
affairs, and a man is even at a late period of 
life thrown upon the world unprovided for, 
except so far as his economy and prudence 
may have laid up something for a rainy day. 
The growing taste for florists' flowers renders

it very likely that a man may be asked, not " if 
he can grow them," for he might say, yes, but 
" if he had been used to them ; " and if he 
were unable to say yes, it might be fatal; and 
if after saying so the employer found he had 
not, he would lose confidence, because a man 
used to florists' flowers. can see in an instant 
whether a man has or has not been used to 
handling them ; for it is, whatever may be 
said of it, v€ry unlike other gardening. There 
is more attention wanted, but less labour. It 
is like setting a tailor to make millinery, to set 
a regular gardener who is not used to it to 
grow floi'ists' flowers ; but they will become 
so necessary an appendage to a good establish- 
ment that it will be necessary for all gardeners 
to learn how to grow them ; and though he 
may think he can do it at any time he chooses, 
he will find himself very awkward, and his 
subject very troublesome. It is a very com- 
mon practice with first-rate gardeners to affect 
to despise florists' flowers. It would be just 
as sensible to despise an improved peach or 
pear in behalf of the wild plum. Culture has 
raised both from their humble and simple 
nature to subjects worthy of the highest re- 
gard. It is only those who cannot grow them, 
or who are ignorant of the treatment they 
require, that affect to despise them ; and no- 
thing would be more safe than to conclude 
that a man who speaks of them lightly is 
ignorant of the treatment they want, and un- 
willing to own it, as indeed all men are to 
admit they are at all deficient. We would 
engage to show that nine gentlemen's head 
gardeners out of ten would feel at a loss if a 
bed of tulips, or a collection of auriculas, or 
carnations and picotees, were placed in their 
care to be grown for exhibition ; and it is 
sheer nonsense to speak slightingly of them 
on this account : it will be far better to buy a 
few and to grow them, and thus make them- 
selves acquainted with them, than to remain 
in ignorance and pretend to despise them. 
They will find that to tie and bloom and dress 
the carnation, and to flower the auricula, will 
require some ingenuity, however apt they may 
be at learning; and that, notwithstanding close 
application, such knowledge is not to be ac- 
quired off-hand, or without some experience. 
Gardeners may rely upon it that our advice 
is not premature ; ladies and gentlemen will 
want to find in their gardens those things 
which they see at shows : there is nothing 
more certain than this, and gardeners will 
have, sooner or later, to cultivate them ; so 
that the sooner they begin the better, and by 
obtaining a few, which any gardener would 
give them, to begin, they will become gra- 
dually accustomed to them, and the care of a 
few will make it easy to superintend a good 
many, for it is mere increase of labour.

Proceedings of the Horticultural 

Society of London, with notes by a 

Practical Gardener. 

Shrivelling of Grapes. — It is well 
known that after the berries are formed upon 
the bunch, they advance pretty rapidly in 
size until the period when the seeds are form- 
ing, when for a time their increase seems sus- 
pended. Immediately after this it sometimes 
happens that the foot- stalks suddenly turn 
brown and shrink, and the berries, ceasing to 
increase in size, shrivel, acquire an unpleasant 
taste, and ultimately fall off. By many gar- 
deners this disease is attributed to the badness 
of the borders on which the vines are planted, 
but it will be found that it arises from a 
totally different cause. 

At the formation of the seeds, the skins of 
the berries as well as of the foot-stalks are 
remarkably tender, and consequently easily 
affected by the surrounding atmosphere. If 
fresh air is not given early in the morning, 
before the internal air becomes heated, a 
vapour rises in the house, which is perceptible 
by its condensing on the glass and walls, and 
on any ironwork that may be in the house. 
If under these circumstances the bunches of 
fruit are carefully examined, the moisture will 
be found plentifully collected on the berries, 
and more particularly on the foot-stalks. This 
is the destructive material, for as the tempera- 
ture of the house is increased, an effect equal 
to scalding is produced on the cuticle of the 
berries, and hence the diseased appearance 
which they assume, and should the sun break 
suddenly out the destruction becomes complete. 

To prevent this, one or two of the top 
sashes should be drawn down a little, early in 
the morning, and if the day opens out bright 
and sunny, the rest of them may also be drawn 
down. Unless the day be very warm, the 
front lights should not be opened, for a current 
of air is produced by this, which in cold 
weather is very liable to produce a spotting 
upon the berries, a disease scarcely less in- 
jurious than the scalding". This, however, does 
not prevent the berries from colouring, but if 
the spots become large, the berries take an 
irregular shape, and cease to improve in size. 
The first appearance of this disorder is a 
number of very minute brown spots, which 
penetrate quite through the skin, sometimes 
affecting some of the berries only, sometimes 
the whole bunch. — Letter by Mr. D. Judd. 

The cultivation of an early and a 
late variety of the pear on the same 
Tree. — The advantage of this plan in a small 
garden, where the walls are not extensive, is 
obvious ; and even where there is a great 
extent of wall, when it is considered that it is 
mostly the south exposure that is used for the

produce of early and late sorts of Pears, in the 
climate of Scotland, the benefit is great. By 
having the branches of Pear trees, alternately, 
one early the other late, there are as it were 
two chances of success ; the Jargonelle being 
veiy early in blossom, if that fails in conse- 
quence of unfavourable weather, the late sort 
flowering at another time may succeed. An- 
other advantage arises from the crop coming 
in at different seasons. The Jargonelle ripens 
off before much effort is required from the 
tree to support the late sort, so that the tree 
is more capable of supplying nourishment to 
half a crop of Jargonelles, than if the crop 
were all of that sort ; and as the early Pears 
are all gathered before the late sort begins to 
swell to size, the tree is at once relieved from 
half its crop, and in that case more enabled to 
mature in greater perfection its late produce. 
My experience in the practice enables me to 
state that the trees produce finer fruit in this 
way than if they were all of one sort. — Letter 
by Mr. D. Montgomery. 

[It is the practice in Scotland to grow several 
varieties of Pears on the same tree against 
walls. The necessity, caused by the climate, 
of training most of the Pears on warm expo- 
sures, has induced the adoption of this economy 
of wall room. It is however worthy of imita- 
tion in private gardens in England ; for as 
few families can consume the entire produce 
of a full-sized well managed Pear tree of any 
one kind, much waste would be avoided, as 
well as more variety for the table secured, if 
every tree on a wall were worked with two or 
more kinds. "We have successfully worked five 
sorts on a Jargonelle tree cut back on pur- 
pose, and nothing could do better; all we had to 
do was to use the knife freely to the Jargonelle, 
which wanted to supersede the others.] 

The Alpine Strawberry. — I possess two 
seminal varieties, which are rather larger and 
sweeter than alpine strawberries in general ; 
from these I take runners in August or Sep- 
tember, and plant a bed near to the garden 
pump, or pond. By the following spring the 
bed will be well stocked with plants, and early 
in the month of May, when they are in full 
flower, I cut away all the blossoms, pi'eserving 
the leaves uninjured ; this is again repeated at 
the end of the month. Towards the middle 
or end of June more blossoms appear, and the 
plants afford flowers and fruit all the latter 
part of the summer, and till cut off by the 
autumnal frosts. If the first blossoms were 
not removed, the principal crop of Alpines 
would be ripe at the time the larger straw- 
berries are in season, and consequently of 
little worth ; but by this mode of culture, 
they come into bearing in the latter part of 
the summer, just at the time the other kinds 
are over. — Letter by J. Williams, Esq. 



[We prefer sowing the seed, and hoeing 
them out like turnips, for they grow best when 
close together ; and without any other culture 
than keeping them clear of weeds, they bloom 
and bear from May till the frost kills them, 
and we have known this to be at Christmas. 
They do not require water if they are in rich 
ground and close together, for their own 
foliage appears to protect them.] 

Management of Fruit Trees in Pots. 
— I have more than once mentioned the im- 
portance of giving to fruit trees, from which 
a crop of fruit is required very early in the 
season, a high degree of excitability, or the 
power to vegetate very strongly in moderately 
low temperature, at the period -when they are 
first subjected to artificial heat : and I have 
pointed out the advantages of 'retaining all 
trees which are intended to afford such very 
early crops in pots. I have endeavoured to 
ascertain within how short a period, in the 
ordinary temperature of my pine stove, plants 
of the Chasselas and Verdelho vine could be 
made to yield mature fruit. The subjects of 
this experiment had produced a crop of fruit 
previously to midsummer, and in the follow- 
ing month of July, they had been taken from 
the stove, after having been for some time 
sparingly supplied with water, and placed 
under a north wall ; in which situation they 
remained nearly torpid till autumn, when they 
were pruned. Early in the winter, I observed 
in them strong symptoms of a disposition to 
vegetate, though they remained in the cold 
and shaded situation in which they were first 
placed, when removed from the stove : and on 
the 12th of January I found the buds so much 
swollen, that I feared the exposure to frost 
would prove fatal to them ; and the pots were 
consequently removed to the stove. In this, 
the sudden increase of temperature occasioned 
every visible bud to unfold itself within a very 
few days; and on the 17th of the following 
month, being thirty-six days after the pots 
were brought into the stove, the berries of 
some bunches of the Verdelho grape were so 
far grown, that I could have thinned them 
with advantage. In the end of March the 
Chasselas grapes became soft and transpa- 
rent, and in the middle of April some bunches 
were as mature, and much more yellow, than 
those of the same kind usually are when first 
brought to the London market in the spring ; 
though the weather had been, during the 
earlier part of the spring, dark and cloudy, 
and consequently unfavourable. The wood 
of these vines appeared nearly mature in the 
end of April, and by removing them from the 
stove for a short time, to a cold and shaded 
situation, and subsequently replacing them in 
the stove, I do not doubt the practicability of 
obtaining another crop from them within the

same year. A pot which contains a quantity 
of mould equal to a cube of fourteen inches, 
has been found large enough for a vine whose 
foliage occupied a space of twenty square feet ; 
water holding manure in solution being abun- 
dantly given ; and I have seen grapes acquire 
a larger size, and other fruits a higher flavour, 
under such management than under any other. 
The supposed necessity of frequently re- 
moving fruit-trees, which grow in pots, to 
other pots of larger dimensions, appears to 
present a good deal of inconvenience ; but I 
have readily obviated this necessity, by means 
which I can confidently recommend to the 
attention of gardeners. When the plant or 
firuit-tree is first placed in the pot, in which 
it is long to remain, I mix with the compost 
some material, in greater or less quantity, which 
is capable of ultimately affording nutriment, 
but which will decompose slowly. In some cases 
I have used with success slender half-decayed 
branches from my wood pile ; and in others 
I have employed sound chips, chiefly of apple- 
tree, mixed with mould, and in sufficient 
quantity to occupy at least one-fourth of the 
space afforded by the pot. As the roots of 
the plant increase, the lifeless wood gradually 
decomposes, at the same time giving food and 
space to the roots, which consequently do not 
become injuriously compressed in the pot. I 
possess a nectarine tree which has grown nine 
years in the same pot. Several successive 
crops of fungi usually appear upon the sur- 
face of the pots under the preceding circum- 
stances ; but I have had no reason to think 
these injurious. — Letter by T. A. Knight, 
Esq. 

[Where very early forced fruit is required, 
the practice of growing the trees in pots has 
often been adopted with advantage ; as there 
is much risk in obtaining a very early crop ; 
and a failure of potted plants, of which a 
supply should be kept on hand, is less fatal 
to obtaining a crop than if permanent plants 
were exposed to the same chances and vicissi- 
tudes. Vines in pots are often forced ; peach 
and nectarine trees more rarely ; cherries 
frequently. All the small fruit, as goose- 
berries, raspberries, currants, &c, may be 
forced in pots. Plants for the purpose ought 
to be well prepared.] 

Charcoal for Hyacinths. — Sir Thomas 
Franklin once stated the effect of charcoal in 
restoring to health a hyacinth root, which was 
prepared for blowing in water, and after 
being a short time in the glass, threw out 
only a few fibres, which soon died at their ex- 
tremities, the bulb becoming offensively 
putrid. A table- spoonf id of powdered char- 
coal was stirred into the water, which imme- 
diately corrected the bad smell ; but on the 
second morning after, it began to return. 



Charcoal and water being renewed three times 
at two days' interval, the root became per- 
fectly sweet, and flowered as well and nearly 
as soon as one of the same variety (Groot 
Vorst) which was placed on the chimney-piece 
near it. 

[This putridity could not have passed be- 
yond one or two outer skins, because it was 
impossible to recover the rotten portion ; but 
charcoal will sweeten anything ; even putrid 
fish would no longer smell offensive if well 
covered with charcoal.] 

Lilium japonicum. — In August of 1821, 
Mr. Brookes, of Ball's Pond, sent a specimen 
of Lilium Japonicum to the Horticultural 
Society, with the following communication : — 
The bulb was planted in the spring in a brick 
pit, used for the growth of Moutans, and at 
that time it was about the size of a small 
Nonpareil apple, being indiscriminately taken 
from a large number imported from China. 
The height of the flowering stems, of which 
it threw up five, was full five feet ; four of 
the stems produced three flowers on each, in 
which the length of the petals is about six 
inches, and the expansion of the flower about 
seven inches ; the remaining stem produced 
but one flower. The bulb was planted in 
equal portions of Wimbledon bog mould 
and strong loam, and until the top of the 
plant reached the glass it was occasionally 
covered by the light of the frame. Lilium 
japonicum appears to be sufficiently hardy to 
endure our winters, as I have had a bed of 
them in the open ground two years without 
protection ; the leaves and stems were, how- 
ever, much injured by the wind and rain, 
while growing, and none attained a height 
exceeding fifteen inches. I am therefore of 
opinion that if treated as a hardy plant, it should 
be grown in a situation well protected by 
trees and shrubs, and not in the front of the 
flower border. Like most of its congeners, 
it delights in shade, and is well adapted to 
ornament thick and close shrubberies where 
other herbaceous plants do not thrive ; it is 
easily propagated by separating the scales of 
the bulbs, each of which in time will become 
a good plant ; it forms also small bulbs on the 
stem, below the surface of the ground. — Let- 
ter by S. Brookes, Esq. 

Management of Cauliflower Plants. 
— I sow the seeds of the Early Cauliflower 
in a south border, in the beginning of July, 
and as soon as the plants come up I thin 
them out to twelve or fourteen inches apart, 
where I suffer them to remain, keeping them 
clean, and watering them occasionally till 
about the middle of November, by which 
time they all produce heads from ten to thirty 
inches in circumference. As they are not 
hardy enough to bear more than three or four

degrees of frost, I remove them at that time 
into a shed which will keep out ten de- 
grees of frost, taking care to retain as much 
mould about their roots as possible, and to 
remove all their decayed leaves. In the shed 
they are planted in mould, keeping a space of 
about an inch between each head. In this 
state they are frequently looked over with 
care, their dead leaves removed, and those 
heads cut for present use which show any 
disposition to decay. When severe frost 
occurs, the plants are covered with dry short 
hay. By this management I have been able 
to send three dishes of cauliflowers to the 
table every week during the autumn and 
winter until February. — Letter by Jlr. G. 
CockJbum. 

[The heads of Brocoli or Cauliflower may 
be preserved for a long time in this way, 
if they are closely watched, so that decay does 
not commence in any and spread among the 
•rest : of course both they and the soil they are 
placed in are kept dry.] 

The CEixuii amabile . — When a small 
plant I sunk the pot in which it grew about 
two-thirds of its depth into a bed of sand in 
the stove. Underneath the pit, which is thus 
filled with sand to the depth of twelve inches, 
is a chamber extending the whole length of 
the pit, the air in the chamber being heated 
by a fire flue passing round it, by which 
means the sand is kept constantly warm. The 
pot in which the plant grows is sixteen inches j 
in diameter at the top, but the bottom is of 
smaller dimensions, and the depth is about 
equal to its upper diameter. Soon after the 
pot was plunged in the sand, the roots of the \ 
bulb found their way into the sand through 
the holes, as well as through a crack in the 
bottom of the pot, and have gradually ex- • 
tended themselves a considerable distance in 
it ; and to this circumstance I attribute its ; 
luxuriant growth. The pit is frequently 
watered, and it seems as if the moistened 
sand was peculiarly congenial to this bulb. 
In October it produced its first blossoms ; the 
next year it flowered three times, and the 
year after four times. The soil within the 
pot is a rich loam, mixed with a portion of 
vegetable mould and rotten dung. The house 
is generally kept in a brisk heat, and abun- 
dance of water is given to the plant, especially 
when it puts forth its blossom. The bulb in 
the thickest part, next the soil, is two feet 
three inches in circumference ; a considerable 
part of it grows above the surface of the 
earth, having a long extended stem or neck, 
which terminates at the top in a crown of 
leaves spreading elegantly in every direction, 
with the ends bending downwards ; the leaves 
are from four to five feet long, and from five 
to six inches wide in the broadest part ; their 



edges are smooth, and, when held up to the 
light, appear very regularly striated longi- 
tudinally. The flowering stem, or scape, 
breaks out from the neck of the bulb, below 
the leaves : it is compressed, not round, about 
three inches in circumference, grows generally 
three feet or more in length, and is slightly 
I tinged with colour. The umbel of flowers is 
at first enveloped in a slightly tinged green 
spathe, about eight inches long, which divides 
i into two parts, and becomes reflexed close to 
the scape, showing its inner surface, which is 
I very pale and shining. The flowers usually 
average above thirty ; they rise irregularly 
• from the flattened top of the scape, inter- 
| mixed with narrow bractese, which are from 
I three to four inches long, their inside being 
nearly white, and their backs keeled and 
stained with lake. Each separate flower has 
a peduncle about an inch and a half long, 
more or less speckled with the same colour as 
the rest of the flower, but duller, sometimes 
r it is nearly all green ; the gerniens are slightly 
swollen ; the tubes from four to five inches 
long, nearly cylindrical, and of a dull shining 
lake ; the backs of the lacinias, before they 
expand, exhibit the same colour as the tube, 
but more brilliant ; the lacinias, when ex- 
panded, are upwards of six inches long, lance- 
olate, and show their inner surface white, 
with a broad stripe of lake down the centre ; 
the filaments are purple, half the length of 
the lacinias ; the anthers, when open, are 
yellow ; the stigma is purple, and a little 
longer than the filaments. The whole bunch 
of flowers grows compactly together; but 
frequently extends two feet ; I have counted 
fourteen blossoms open at the same time, 
each of them a foot in expansion ; they are 
individually of short duration, the outside 
ones open first, and at that time those that 
are nearest the centre are in the state of 
buds of different sizes, but all smaller and 
shorter than the outer ones. No description 
can convey an adequate idea of the splendour 
of this magnificent plant, which possesses the 
additional charm of an agreeable fragrance in 
its blossoms. The colour has been variously 
described as rose, rosy-purple, and carmine ; 
but I think it is nearest to a lake. I have 
frequently impregnated the stigma with the . 
pollen of its own anthers ; but the germen 
constantly falls a short time after the flowers 
are withered. — From, a Letter by Mr. James 
Verrell.

BIGNONIA LIXDLEYI. 



433 




BIG X X I A L I X D L E Y I. 

(AlpTionse Be Candolle.) 

DE. LFSTDLEY's TKOIPET-FLOWER. 



This plant is better known in gardens as 
Bignonia picta, under which name it was 
figured in the Botanical Register in 1842 ; 
it is not, however, the plant originally so 
named by Humboldt and Bonpland. In 
describing the species of Bignoniaceas in the 
Prodromus, Alph. De Candoile has given it 
the name which stands at the head of this 
article, and which, according to the laws of 
botanists, it will henceforward bear. 

It is a very elegant plant ; a climber of 
moderate growth, adapted either for a large 
pot specimen, or for training to the front 
trellises and pillars of a greenhouse or cool 
conservatory ; most of the Bignonias are very 
rampant growers, and do not flower well 
without they are allowed tolerably free scope, 
but the more restricted habit of the present 
plant is a very great additional recommenda- 
tion to it. The plant is smooth, the stems 
furnished with opposite leaves, which are 
what is called conjugate, that is, two growing 
together on the same petiole ; in other words, 
the leaves grow in pairs ; thus, at each joint 
will be found two pairs, or four leaves (pro- 
perly leaflets) about three inches long : from 
the apex of each petiole, and between the 
pair of leaflets which it supports, a tendril is 
produced. The flowers grow at the apex of 
the numerous short lateral branches, and are I 
always produced in pairs : the calyx is bell- 
shaped, with five sharp-pointed teeth ; the ; 
corolla has an obconical almost cylindrical ' 
tube, about two inches long, divided at the 
end into five obovate roundish somewhat 
undulated lobes : these flowers are about an 
48. 



inch and a half across, the tube very pale 
coloured, the limb pale violet or lilac, veined 
with deep purplish red, and rather darker at 
the throat. 

The history of the introduction of this plant 
is rather obscure. It appears to have been 
first flowered, in 1842. by Messrs. Bjllisson 
of Tooting ; and is supposed to have been in- 
troduced from Buenos Ayres, or some adja- 
cent part of the South American continent. 
In a cultivated state it blooms throughout a 
considerable part of the mid-summer months. 

Our subject was at first grown in the stove, 
and has been subsequently regarded as a half- 
hardy plant. TTe are not aware to how great 
an extent its hardiness has been tested. In 
the meantime, as a greenhouse conservatory 
climber, there are few plants calculated to 
produce a finer effect on the lower parts of the 
trellises and pillars near the front of the house. 
It should be planted in rich loamy soil some- 
what lightened with peat, and allowed a 
tolerable range for its roots. If potted, a 
similar soil should be used, and a considerable 
share of pot -room must be allowed. TThen 
planted out, of course the branches must be 
fastened to the trellises provided for them, but 
only the principal ones should be so fixed, 
all the smaller lateral branches being allowed 
to hang free, and assume their own natural 
positions. If kept in a pot, there is no better 
plan than that of leading the principal stems 
spirally around a cylinder-shaped or pillar 
trellis. It is not desirable to train climbing 
plants too rigorously ; they like their liberty, 
and thrive better, if to some extent it is

allowed them ; but, of course, they must not 
lie allowed to run into confusion, and should 
be finally trained in, before they become set 
to any awkward form. The position of the 
branches ought never to be altered at or near 
the blooming period, as this is certain to dis- 
place the foliage, and if this has not time to 
right itself, the effect of the plant is spoiled. 
It is scarcely possible — nay, as a rule, it may 
be regarded as impossible — to alter the posi- 
tion of a branch of a climbing plant, and yet 
retain the foliage in the same plane ; young 
shoots soon accommodate themselves to the 
position in which they are placed, but with 
older branches this takes longer time to ac- 
complish. Of water, a pretty good supply 
■will be required, at least during growth; this, 
during the season of rest — that is, the winter, 
may, of course, be in some degree limited. 
The branches will require an annual pruning 
and regulation ; this is best seen to in autumn, 
and should consist in removing entirely any 
old worn-out shoots, as well as such parts of 
the younger ones as are unripe and immature. 
If this is done early in autumn, the additional 
exposure to light Avill assist the remaining por- 
tion in ripening completely before the winter 
comes on. It is only from such perfectly 
matured and fully ripened wood, that strong 
vigorous growth, with abundant blossoms, can 
be expected. 

Propagation is to be effected either by seeds, 
when they are obtained, which should be 
sown in pots of light soil, and set in a hotbed; 
or by cuttings of the half-ripened slender 
shoots, planted in sand, and placed in a hot- 
bed. In either case, the sooner — after roots 
are formed — the plants are potted separately 
the better ; and the young plants should be 
nursed on in a warm house or frame until 
they have acquired some strength, when they 
may be treated in the same way as mature 
plants. 

HETEROTROPA ASAROIDES. 

(Decaisne.) 

ASARABACCA- LIKE HETEROTROPA. 

This plant has more singularity than beauty 
to recommend it. It is closely allied to the 
Asarums, or Asarabaccas, of which three or 
four smad hardy herbaceous species are culti- 
vated in botanical collections. The whole 
natural family to which these belong, the 
Aristolochiaceae or Birthwort tribe, is remark- 
able for a peculiar grotesqueness of character 
and luridness or dulness of colouring. In the 
genus Aristolochia, of which there are many 
tine climbing species in cultivation, there are 
some species whose blossoms are exceedingly 
curioiB— long pouch-like bodies, bellied out 
on one side, here contracted, there dilated. 



and presently spreading out like a broad flap, 
or in other cases stretching into a long narrow 
tail, and often curiously chequered in colour. 
The present plant accords with its congeners, 
in the flowers being of a dull hue, and pos- 
sessing a singular conformation. 

Both the Heterotropas, and their allies, the 
Asarums, are small perennial plants. The 
present plant, indeed, does not exceed six 
inches in height, and is of evergreen habit, 
producing two or three leaves from the crown, 
and throwing out on a short stalk, so as to be 
situated close to their base, one of its singular 
blossoms, which lasts a considerable time in 
perfection. From the crown of the plant 
proceed downwards a few short thick fibrous 




fc-> 



roots, and upwards the tuft of leaves, which 
are borne on stalks three inches and a half 
long ; they are cordate, with a deep indenta- 
tion at the base, three to four inches long, 
slightly waved and reflected at the edges, dull 
green and irregularly blotched with lighter 
coloured spots on the upper surface, and 
shining, and having purple veins and blotches 
beneath. The flower is seated at the base of 
the leaves, and is about as large as a walnut, 
and of a cartilaginous texture ; it is perfumed 
somewhat like a ripe apple ; it consists of a 
spheroidal tube, shining on the outside, of a 
dull purple colour marked with grey, and a 
three parted reflected limb, of a darker purple. 
The segments of the limb are large, rounded, 
undulate, and transversely wrinkled ; near the 
throat these wrinkles are drawn up into thin 
wavy edges of a brighter purple, the outer 
ones crested with white ; the throat is half 
closed by a transverse plate of the same struc- 
ture, having a triangular opening in the middle. 
These appearances are pretty well indicated 
in the engraving. 

The Heterotropa is regarded as being the 
same as the Asarum virginicum (Thunberg), 
a plant which is met with both in Virginia 
and in Japan ; this Asarum is recorded to 
have been introduced to this country so long 



TETRANEMA MEXICANA.

ago as 1759. More recently the plant has 
been brought by Siebold from Japan, and 
from this source was re-introduced in 1836, 
and distributed among some few botanical col- 
lections. When kept in a greenhouse, it 
comes into blossom about the end of February; 
but treated as a hardier plant it blossoms 
during April, and sometimes in May. 

It should be kept in a pot, and during win- 
ter ought to have the protection of a frame ; 
in summer they ought to be placed in a cool, 
somewhat shaded situation, and must be 
liberally supplied with water. If they are 
set in a situation where they will obtain only 
the morning sun, they will thrive well enough. 
The soil for them may be any light loamy 
soil, but a mixture consisting of equal parts 
loam and peat, with a little sand, is, perhaps, 
as good as any to keep them in a healthy con- 
dition, and in a medium state of growth. 
They are propagated without difficulty by 
dividing the plant into as many pieces, if 
requisite, as there are crowns. 




TETRANEMA MEXICANA. 

(Bentkam.) 
THE MEXICAN TETRANEMA. 

This is a very pretty little greenhouse or 
frame herbaceous perennial plant, growing 
with a tuft of ovate-oblong leaves, wrinkled 
something like those of a primrose, but more 
pointed, and throwing up to the height of six 
or eight inches many slender flower-sterns, 
bearing at the top a corymb usually of from 
ten to twenty flowers. The flower consists of 
a slender tube, divided at the extremity into 
five spreading segments, forming what is 
called a two-lipped flower, that is, the divi- 
sion between the two upper and the three 
lower segments on each side are deeper than the 
other division, thus forming two main divi- 
sions, which are respectively called the upper 
and lower lips. As the name implies, it is a 
native of Mexico, whence it was introduced 
about 1841. The flowers are produced, ac- 
cording to the treatment given, during the 
summer or autumnal months. 

The plants may be grown into a large tuft 
with several crowns, or of smaller size with 
a single tuft of leaves, and in either way forms 



a neat and interesting object. It is particu- 
larly useful as an autumnal flowering plant 
for ornamenting the greenhouse, for which 
purpose it is well adapted, when kept cool 
and retarded in its growth during summer, 
so as to cause it to blossom about September. 
j This is done by setting the plants during 
summer in a north aspect, and keeping them 




pretty well potted in the early part of the 
season : they must be regularly sup- 
plied with water, so as to sustain no check 
from droughts which might induce the flower- 
ing state. Towards the end of August they 
may be removed to a frame with a southern 
exposure, where they may be protected by 
the sashes at nights and during heavy rains, 
but not entirely closed up. As they come 
into flower they may be removed to the 
greenhouse. The soil for them should be 
composed of about three parts sandy peat, 
and one part turfy loam, and the pots must be 
well drained with broken potsherds and lumps 
of charcoal. For a large-sized plant a five- 
inch pot will be suitable ,• but the small 
single crown plants above referred to, will 
flower w e n in a three-inch one. 

It is desirable to keep a continued stock of 
young plants, for although a perennial, the 
older plants sometimes die off suddenly, and 
young plants of a year old are generally 
more vigorous in their growth. In the winter 
the plants must be kept on a dry shelf in the 
greenhouse, or in a very dry cool frame. 
They do not require more than protection 
from frost ; but are liable to suffer much in- 
jury from confined damp ; and where there is 
the convenience of a greenhouse this will be 
found the least troublesome way of preserving 
them. If they are placed in frames, the frost 
must be excluded either by coverings or the 
application of slight artificial warmth. For 
flowering at the ordinary season, the plants 
may be repotted in spring, and set in the 
front part of the greenhouse near the sashes 
where there is plenty of air ; and if it is not 
convenient to continue them in that position 
they may afterwards be removed to the shelter 
of a frame — not, however, in a shady position. 
The plants are impatient of an excess of 
water at any time, and therefore, whenever

exposed to the open air, must be guarded 
against heavy rains. 

When first introduced this plant was 
thought to be a Pentstemon, and for some time 
passed in gardens under the name of Pent- 
stemon meocicanum. It is, or was, also called 
P. prhnulinus in some continental gardens. 
It was, however, found to be botanically dis- 
tinct from the Pentstemons, and was accord- 
ingly named Tetranema, derived from tetra, 
four, and nemo, a filament, in allusion to the 
number of stamens found in its blossoms, 
Pentstemon having five stamens. It belongs 
to the natural order Scrophulariaceas, and 
the Linnasan Didynamia Angiospermia. 

FLOWER SHOWS. 
CAPABILITY FOR ACTIXG AS A JUDGE. 

"With regard to the judgment displayed by 
men of experience in Floriculture, nothing 
can be much clearer than the fact, that it 
must be a sort of natural gift that qualifies a 
man for a good judge, otherwise those who 
have had great experience could never com- 
mit the errors they do in their awards of 
prizes, and opinions of Florists' flowers. When 
Mathew's Enchantress first came out we said 
in an instant it was the best of its class ; one 
florist, who has been considered to know 
something about these things, would not 
allow it had any such merit ; no, it was 
crumpled, it was this, that, and the other. 
Now, however, it has been out awhile, and 
people have grown it upon our recommen- 
dation, nobody ventures to dispute that it 
is, as we affirmed, the very best of its class. 
We could mention twenty similar instances. 
If we go back to Dahlias, it will be remem- 
bered that Mr. Widnall disputed with us 
about Springfield Eival, and others besides 
him insisted that Widnall's Perfection was the 
better flower. Nay, it was obstinately con- 
tested, when shown the year it was let out; but 
with half a glance, we had determined its 
merit in the seed-bed, and up to this day it 
can rarely be beaten in all points in its own 
class ; at all events, it outlived the Perfec- 
tion by many years. It may be, that interest 
has something to do with florists' decisions, 
but men will not wilfully stake their credit 
upon events that must be decided against 
them ultimately. We are bound, therefore, 
to believe that they are not good judges, and 
that practice in such cases does not make 
perfect. There is such a thing as showy 
flowers out of character. There are oc- 
casionally extraordinary specimens of flowers, 
not generally good ; and as judgment can 
only be formed upon what is placed be- 
fore us, it is quite possible a man may be de- 
ceived, however good judge he may be; and 
the only check against being deceived is ; to 



require a number of blooms, and to have it 
declared from how many plants they have 
been cut. The greatest plague a raiser has to 
contend with is uncertainty, and some of 
our most beautiful flowers have been aban- 
doned because they were uncertain. 

Turner's Metropolitan, the finest model of 
a flower that ever was seen, proved so 
uncertain, that he gave it away instead of 
charging for it ; and we have had more than 
one letter, stating that it was the finest flower 
the writers had in their collection. Had 
this gone out at half-a-guinea we should 
have been abused by all the buyers for 
speaking highly of it. Egyptian Fung was 
handsome and uncertain, Conqueror of the 
World was beautiful but uncertain, and many 
others have been nearly or quite abandoned, 
{ only because a man had need grow a hedge-row 
of them to get a bloom, and then perhaps might 
fail. If, then, the best judges, who must 
decide from what is before them, are liable to 
mislead when a flower is very uncertain, how 
much it behoves a Society to procure good 
judges — in seedlings, not merely people who 
have bought, and sold, and grown the flower 
they are to judge a long while, but men who 
are known to decide upon principles, and who 
know when they see a good flower that it is so. 
Xo man can be a good judge until he can 
go in among flowers with a perfect model 
forcibly impressed on his imagination ; he can 
then instantly detect imperfections, and de- 
cide whether they are sufficient to justify the 
rejection of the flower. We have seen so 
repeatedly the error and obstinacy of a man 
who has fancied he was a judge, and contested 
the points with one who really was so, that 
we think judges as important as prizes; and 
the Society that cannot employ the one might 
as well not give the other. It is a complete 
farce to send in mere growers; and to fancy 
that a man can learn it if it do not come 
natural to him, is a fallacy. We have watched 
the progress of an amateur who has been 
some years employed to give opinions on 
flowers, but who is as incapable now as he 
was the first hour he was set at it, and has 
committed his employers as much the very 
last year as he did the first, though from the 
fact of being considered no authority, the 
mischief he does is very limited. We have 
been sadly blamed for attributing to design 
what has been purely ignorance, but we have 
honestly done it : we have believed it was 
design, on account of the extravagance of the 
injustice committed, and we have felt it im- 
possible to believe that a man's vision could 
so deceive him, as to enable him to arrive at 
a conclusion so palpably wrong. Who, for 
instance, could believe that any living man 
who had ever seen a dozen dahlias, would

have placed Brown's Model above the Stan- 
dard of Perfection ? Was there a shadow of a 
chance to the uninitiated that such a decision 
was accidental ? Who in this wide world 
would believe it possible that the Fuchsia St. 
Clare could have been honestly recommended 
as worth a single penny, or the pot it was 
grown in ? Surely when things so utterly 
worthless can be recognised by anybody, we 
might be pardoned for attributing it to design, 
in the belief, that it was impossible to be the 
result of an honest opinion. Men who have 
no better pretensions to a sound judgment do 
not act honestly in undertaking the task, and 
they completely lay themselves open to what- 
ever animadversion people may make upon 
their extraordinary decisions. Strange as it 
may be, there is rarely a show in which there 
is not some strange muddle in awarding the 
prizes ; and often is it so outrageously in- 
correct, that exhibitors feel indignant and 
mortified beyond measure at the result ; we 
even now find it difficult to bring our mind to 
believe that men can be so thoroughly igno- 
rant as to commit such egregious blunders. 
A Pansy at the last Surrey Flower Show was 
awarded a prize, and called Perfection : the 
judges may have thought so, but if they did, 
they ought never to judge another. 

We have often made men very angry by 
rejecting their flowers; but, although we have 
been, in common with many others, disap- 
pointed at a flower turning out uncertain 
after it has been exhibited in first-rate order, 
we never condemned one that was, as com- 
pared with those we possessed already, at all 
worth growing ; yet have we been often 
obliged to battle a thing out against three or 
four people who have obstinately contended 
for giving a prize to a tiling not worthy of it, 
but which, in their eyes, from some cause or 
other, appeared to deserve one. We incline, 
therefore, to believe, that some men are not 
good judges, and never would be; they never 
see, or if they see, they lose sight of the most 
palpable blemishes, and they get angry with 
us for pointing them out. We have been 
now nearly fifteen years endeavouring to 
teach men how to estimate flowers and plants; 
but, although they agree with us as to the 
points, they overlook some of the principal 
ones, and when left to themselves, commit 
sad havoc in awarding prizes; as if they 
had never been shown the difference between 
a good and a bad thing. 

There is no personal merit in being a good 
judge, because it is not easily acquired. It 
must come, and does come natural. Those 
who really do understand it, see faults and ex- 
cellencies in an instant, and want no prompt- 
ing. Those who do not possess the faculty, 
may have the faults and beauties pointed 



out one half hour and forget them the next. 
Our conclusion, and it is a charitable one, 
therefore is, — the dealers who have put forth 
the most worthless things at high prices, and 
assured the public they were excellent, have 
thought they were so ; but if we allow their de- 
cisions to have been honest, which is allowing 
a good deal, we must, nevertheless, insist that 
no man who has done so, ought to trust himself. 
If the public trust him again, he is fortunate.

EFFECT OF GARDENING ON THE RURAL 
POPULATION. 

The good effects of Cottage Gardening is 
already universally acknowledged. The emula- 
tion excited by exhibiting their productions at 
flower shows, has been doubled, not in all cases, 
but in many. It will be admitted that the 
temptation to labour cannot be too great, and 
to the excitement of this feeling ought all 
public exhibitions to tend. Many Societies, 
with the best intentions, have, nevertheless, 
done a good deal of mischief. They have 
given prizes for flowers among a class of men 
who could not, in justice to their families, 
afford to buy them, and the natural influence 
of this has been unfavourable. Cottagers, 
with not a shilling beforehand, have, notwith- 
standing, shown half-guinea dahlias, and seven 
and sixpenny roses, and two-guinea gera- 
niums, and ten-shilling tulips. These things 
are highly improper. If they were honestly 
come by, the money was withdrawn from the 
family ; if not honestly come by, the very 
people who tried to advance the morals have 
been engendering a vice which must end 
fatally. A Society with proper notions cannot 
offer premiums for extravagance any more 
than it can offer rewards for peculation, be- 
cause one engenders the other. If a cottager 
once is made to calculate on beating his rivals 
by the superiority of his collection, there is 
an end of all reliance on industry. It matters 
not whether he begs, borrows, steals, or buys 
his costly flowers, any or all of them are mis- 
chievous, and have a bad effect on the morals. 
Raise a man's ambition to produce better 
carrots, cabbages, potatoes, and useful vegeta- 
bles than his neighbours, and you will excite 
the ambition to shine in a right cause. 

Let us observe the effect of a certain county 
Society on the exhibiting cottagers. Prizes 
were given for dahlias, roses, tulips, and many 
other costly subjects perfectly inconsistent 
with the probable income of the people who 
were to compete, being persons limited in their 
rentals to under ten pounds. There were 
also prizes for vegetables. One man had won 
the head prizes for three years, and another, 
wdio struggled hard against him for the ascen- 
dency, was always just beaten. It chanced 



438

that we were judges on one occasion — the two 
rivals were in the field, and both had good 
flowers — one, however, was apparently well 
to do, the other very poor. Seeing that there 
Avere flowers in both stands very incompatible 
with the men's apparent, or rather their osten- 
sible means, we made searching inquiries into 
both their means, and found them very dif- 
ferent. One had beggared himself, and made 
away with his own clothes, and neglected his 
wife's and children's appearance, and spent 
the money in flowers,^the other had been 
regularly served by a gardener in the neigh- 
bourhood with everything from his master's 
collection, and the said gardener " went 
halves" in all the cottager gained by showing 
and selling flowers. In one case, a man had 
been frugal and well off until a wrong 
spirit had been aroused by the award of prizes 
for flowers among men who could not afford 
to buy them. He had been beaten time after 
time by better flowers, and resolved to get 
better still, if possible. He purchased upon 
credit, and paid for them at so much per week, 
which had to be withheld from his family; and 
deprived them of comforts, of respectability, 
and engendered a sort of indifference to ap- 
pearances, that went a long way towards con- 
firmed demoralization, especially as the man, 
from some cause, neglected one of his pay- 
ments, and became reckless, and the dealer, 
seeing he would be likely to lose, took the 
first steps towards compelling payment. The 
other, with the sole ambition of beating his 
fellow but more humble bretfu-en, had con- 
sented to be the receiver of things stolen 
from a gentleman's garden, which, perhaps, 
he would never have thought of but for the 
folly of those who awarded prizes to poor men 
for subjects which are only appropriate to 
those in good circumstances. It may be said 
that the object was only to encourage the 
growth of common flowers ; but where is the 
limit when the prizes are for the best ? They 
might as well offer a race-cup for cottagers' 
horses, and say they meant the cottagers to 
run only their cart-nags, as to give prizes for 
the best flowers shown, and suppose that all 
would show common. But there is no excuse 
for awarding prizes to cottagers for flowers of 
any kind (except, perhaps, cauliflowers), be- 
cause for cottagers' purposes they are perfectly 
useless, and for mere ornament to their gar- 
dens the cottager wants no prize to induce 
him to cultivate all the flowers he ought to 
adopt. There is not one good purpose to be 
attained by inducing cottagers to grow flowers. 
If he loves them, he will get enough for his gar- 
den for his own sake; and if he does not love them, 
all the time he is induced to spend on them is 
labour instead of amusement ; whereas his vege- 
tables ought to bt encouraged; superiority in the 



culture of them is desirable. Everything that 
can influence a working man to occupy his 
time in producing that which is food or money, 
leads him the right way. The expense of 
vegetable seed is comparatively nothing to the 
value of the food produced. There is no 
temptation to beg, borrow, steal, or even to 
buy enough to hurt his home, or deprive his 
family of their proper clothing and comfort, 
so far as his ordinary circumstances permits; 
whereas, if he is induced to lay out crowns 
for this flower, half-sovereigns for that, and 
even shillings for the other, he saddles him- 
self with weekly payments which he cannot 
withhold from his family without curtailing 
their respectability and endangering their 
morals. If the mind be broken down by 
privations, and the pride of neatness and 
cleanliness be wounded for want of the means 
to indulge it, it soon becomes reckless. The 
most creditable pride the mother of a family 
can have is that which she takes in neatness 
and cleanliness. If she be deprived of the 
means to procure decent clothing for herself 
and children, every week renders her condi- 
tion worse, and the case more hopeless, be- 
cause time makes rapid inroads on dress. The 
more homely it is the more constant must be 
the care and attention ; but time and attention 
cannot create new, though it may preserve old 
for a definite period. 

The madness of giving premiums for extra- 
vagance, of rewarding poor men for apeing 
the rich, of encouraging a man whose only 
time for himself is short, to fritter that little 
away upon useless, profitless subjects, is 
worthy " the root of all evil," instead of 
rational men. Yet we find it more or less 
prevail in all councils. If the devil set about 
his work of demoralization ingeniously, he 
could not begin better than by arousing the 
ambition of those who have nothing to spare, 
and induce them to vie with each other in 
wasting what they had not to spare upon 
worthless subjects. Carry this passion on to 
an extreme, and step by step they will com- 
mit every crime against property to advance 
their objects, until a community of contented 
happy beings are converted into thieves or 
receivers. 

We may be rather harsh in our denuncia- 
tions against cottagers being invited to com- 
pete with each other in the exhibition of 
useless subjects ; but it so counteracts all the 
good which arises from showing vegetables, 
that we confess we would rather see the in- 
dustrious classes banished altogether from 
shows than be allowed to compete for prizes 
given for flowers, as if the object were to 
encourage them to prefer ornament to utility, 
waste and extravagance to economy, sharping 
and overreaching to honourable rivalry.

THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 

Sow angelica, dill, beans, parsnip, peas, 
radish and salads. 

Plant and Transplant borecole, brocoli, 
cabbages, cauliflower, chives, garlic, horse- 
radish, lettuce, potatoes, shallots, and all sorts 
of herbs, as balm, burnet, fennel, hyssop, mint, 
pennyroyal, rue, tansy, thyme, &c. 

Take up and store beet, carrot, cauliflower, 
Jerusalem artichokes, onions, potatoes, par- 
snips, scorzonera, salsify, and turnips. 

General Directions. — The winter operations, 
such as digging, trenching, and ridging the 
ground, may now be commenced, previous 
to which the ground must be cleared, and this 
will consist principally in taking up the 
various tubers and roots, which should be 
done in dry weather ; indeed, it should be a 
rule, that no out-door work be done in wet 
weather ; with good management this will 
never be necessary, as the cleaning, turning, 
and storing of roots, the making of stakes and 
tallies, and similar matters, will be sufficient 
occupation during wet periods. 

Angelica. — Sow (as soon as the seeds are a 
little hardened,) upon a moist soil, and cover 
slightly. 

Beans. — Plant in a warm spot, any time 
this month, in shallow drills, two and a half 
feet apart, and draw up the soil in covering 
them so as to form a small ridge. 



Beet. — Take up the roots, in doing which 
the utmost care is necessary that they are not 
bruised, neither in the lifting nor cleaning ; 
they keep best buried in dry sand, but will 
also do amongst charcoal, dryish soil, or even 
covered with straw, in a cool dark place. 
When removing the leaves, cut them off in a 
conical form, and not so close and horizontal 
as is done with turnips. 

Borecole. — Plant all that there is room for, 
and as early as possible ; run the hoe through 
amongst those planted last month, choosing a 
dry day for doing so. 

Brocoli. — Check, by laying the plants over 
on their side, with the tops northwards. The 
operation is performed thus : — take out a 
spadeful of earth on the north side of each 
plant, then put in the spade on the opposite 
side, and gently raise and press the plant 
down, using the soil taken out, the more 
effectually to keep down the stem; this opera- 
tion is very necessary in severe winters. Go 
over the whole of the early sorts and watch 
their progress, cutting the heads as soon as 
ready. 

Cabbage. — Prick out, and plant early, both 
on a south and north aspect. In severe 
weather the latter will be found the best 
situation; dust the seed bed slightly with soot 
and lime mixed. 

Cardoons. — Earth up the first dry day, 
taking care that no soil gets into the centre 
of the plant, to prevent which, it is necessary 
to tie up the plant closely with twisted hay- 
bands. 

Cauliflower. — Prick out the young plants 



440 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER. 



in frames, hand-lights, or in pots, and keep 
under glass, but give as much air as possible ; 
dust the young plants with soot and lime, 
■which prevents damp, as well as the attacks of 
vermin. 

Celery. — Continue to watch the progress of 
celery, and encourage it by earthing it up 
often, but not much at a time ; never allow 
the soil to choke the plant by getting into the 
heart ; do not touch it when wet. 

Chives should be taken up and re-planted 
every two or three years ; give them rich 
common soil, and a distance of twelve inches 
apart oneway, and six the other. 

Dill. — Sow early in a light soil, and in a 
warm spot, and cover slightly. 

Endive. — Lift with balls, and put it in 
frames, giving no water over head, and admit- 
ting air freely. In sheltered places it should 
be tied up, and allowed to stand until used ; 
always work amongst it when quite dry. 

Garlic. — Plant in a dry and a rich soil, in 
shallow drills three or four inches apart in the 
drill, and ten inches between. 

Herbs, as balm, mint, tansy, &c, may all be 
transplanted now, putting them in a medium 
rich soil, and apportioning the distances accord- 
ing to the height and nature of the plant ; it 
is an advisable plan to keep them together. 

Horseradish may be taken up and re- 
planted, reserving all the finest for winter use; 
it will keep fresh if laid amongst sand, or with 
parsnips or carrots. 

Jerusalem Artichokes may now be taken up 
and laid amongst sand, although they will keep 
without it ; or they may be dug up a few at a 
time, as wanted. 

Leehs should be hoed, and the soil drawn 
slightly up about them. 

Lettuce. — Dust over the small plants with 
lime and wood-ashes. Plant out those in- 
tended to stand the winter in the warmest 
available spot, and some under hand-glasses, 
or in frames. The older plants may be lifted 
with balls, and put in neat rows in frames, 
giving plenty of air and little moisture. 

Onions. — Have the August sowing hoed, 
and thin them out for using in salads. Look 
over those gathered in last month, and clean 
them thoroughly ; in doing so handle them 
gently. 

Parsnijis. — Take up, dress, and store these 
amongst sand ; the roots are the better for 
laying a day or so in a dry place ; try an 
autumn sowing if the ground is dry, deep, and 
rich, but not lately manured. 

Peas. — Sow any of the early sorts, say 
Prince Albert, or Racehorse, at the end of 
the month, along the bottom of the wall ; this 
situation is to be preferred from its shelter, 
and the facility afforded for protecting them ; 
guard against the ravages of mice by trap- 



ping, or mix among the soil coal ashes, or any 
such materials. 

Potatoes. — Plant largely of the early sorts, 
as they are not so liable to be attacked by dis- 
ease ; put in the main crops now, and avoid 
using any rank manure, and cutting the sets. 
Those being stored should be laid thin, and 
often turned, picking out those infected ; in 
every case they must have a cool and dry 
place ; if they get damp, a dusting with lime 
or charcoal is good. 

Radishes. — The last sowing should be made 
early, upon the warmest border at command. 

Salads, as mustard and cress, if sown at all, 
must have a warm spot, or a frame ; it can be 
raised in boxes or large pots at any season, 
where there is a command of artificial heat. 

Salsify. — Take up, dress, and store amongst 
dry sand. The same with scorzonera. Allow 
the fibrous roots of both plants to remain. 

Savoys. — Plant early ; they will be found 
useable about Christmas ; hoe the earlier 
plantings, and divest them of dead leaves. 

Shallots. — Plant in drills an inch or two in 
depth, and six inches and a foot apart. 

Spinach is much improved by being well 
thinned and thoroughly cleaned ; choose a dry 
day for the operation. 

Turnips. — Take up when dry, and dress 
and store away in a cool place, throwing a 
little straw, or such like, over them, to prevent 
the action of the air from shrivelling them. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — The thorough drain- 
ing of the places where fruit trees are to be 
planted should be early attended to ; and such 
trees as have dropped their leaves may be 
lifted. Lose no time in gathering in the 
various fruits, which must now be ready, and 
hasten the ripening of grapes and late fruits, 
by covering at night, and removing every 
shoot that is not required for fruit next year. 
Pruning and nailing may be seen to, about 
the end of the month ; and figs should, in cold 
situations, be early protected by a covering of 
straw and mats. 

Fruit Room. — Continue to keep this apart- 
ment cool, and have each sort distinctly 
marked, and laid out neatly in single layers ; 
none but those of superior quality, and free 
of taint, should be retained ; the early sorts, 
or such as are being used, may be laid thicker, 
but avoid heating or sweating them at any 
time. Always handle the fruit carefully ; the 
bruises which are sustained in the processes 
of gathering and housing, are a prolific source 
of decay. 

Apples are most easily blemished, and must 
be collected as if they were eggs ; when the 
baskets are emptied make the fruit fall or roll, 
as it were, over the arm. If severe frost 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER.

threatens, it will be well to protect the good 
sorts that remain ungathered, but this is sel- 
dom necessary. 

Apricots. — Switch off the remaining leaves, 
and free the trees of any webs and rubbish 
collected amongst the branches ; defer nailing 
and pruning until spring. 

Cherries may be pruned and nailed as soon 
as the leaves are off ; and young, and even old 
trees, may be transplanted now. 

Currants. — The pruning and winter dress- 
ing may be proceeded with by the end of the 
month ; cuttings of the good sorts may also 
be put in now ; make them about eight inches 
long, and insert them in the soil about half- 
way, leaving three eyes at the top, and pro- 
viding about two inches or so of clear stem; 
remove all the lower buds entirely. 

Figs may be slightly protected by the end 
of the month, attempting before then to have 
the wood thoroughly ripened ; divest them 
now of all advanced green fruit. 

Filberts, when gathered, may be spread 
thinly out for a time ; after which, they will 
clean and store away the better in jars, 
amongst dry sand, where they will keep for 
a moderate period. 

Gooseberries. — Fresh plantations may now 
be made ; the established plants pruned and 
dressed ; and cuttings put in amongst a soil 
of sand and leaf mould. The plants like a 
rich and deep soil. 

Medlars should now be gathered, if not 
done ; they are used when in a state of 
decay, as are the fruits of the service-tree. 

Nectarines. — Clear the trees of all green 
leaves and wood, and still make the most of 
the sun ; defer pruning and nailing. 

Peaches. — Give the same treatment as 
nectarines ; both may now be transplanted. 

Pears. — Take equal care of the late sorts 
as of the early ones ; indeed, they must be 
more carefully gathered, as they mostly keep 
for a long time. Pruning, nailing, and trans- 
planting may be proceeded with. 

Plums may be pruned and nailed at the 
end of the month ; attend to laying in the 
young wood thinly and regularly. 

Raspberries. — Prune and tie up partially, 
as they are apt to be twisted too much. Make 
new plantations on a rich soil, and plant them 
at from four to six feet apart, according to 
the soil. 

Strawberries. — Finally dress, by cleaning 
and top-dressing them with a rich compost of 
rotten manure and loam, and slightly fork it in. 

Vines. — It may be safer to have canvas 
over these at night ; give all the light and 
sun possible during the day, and take away 
any superabundant wood that may now mani- 
fest itself; hasten as much as possible the 
ripening of the wood. 



THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — The principal ope- 
rations will consist in giving every place and 
plant a thorough cleaning. Pruning must be 
done as early as possible. All plants to be 
forced should be taken under cover as far as 
practicable. Soils for raising salads, &c. 
must also be kept from rain. A low tem- 
perature must prevail in the whole of the 
apartments, and, as a matter of course, little 
water will be required. Late houses may 
have a little fire to ripen the wood, and the 
same with pits. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature, from 70 to 80 
degrees by day, and 60 to 70 degrees by 
night. Introduce a fresh supply of plants, 
unless those now in are young and healthful. 
For many reasons, a house is preferable to 
either pits or frames for their winter culture ; 
the structure, previous to introducing the 
plants, should be filled with sulphur fumes, 
than which there is nothing more effectual 
for destroying the eggs of insects, &c. The 
soil should contain a good portion of char- 
coal ; and, if they are grown in pots, it must 
be made very rich by watering. In every 
case, train them on a trellis ; give air freely. 

Figs. — Temperature, from 50 to 60 degrees 
by day, and 40 to 50 degrees by night. The 
chief point to see to now, is that the wood is 
thoroughly ripened, and the house may be 
kept warmed if need be, otherwise it may 
be thrown open night and day ; have the 
trees pruned and tied in, and the house 
cleaned by the end of the month. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature, 70 degrees 
by day, and from 45 to 50 degrees at 
night. If not already done, a few of the seeds 
may be put in now. Sow three seeds in a 
nine-inch pot, or sow in boxes and transplant 
them so in pots. Frequent waterings are 
necessary to keep down the red spider. The 
advanced crops should be in the pine stove, 
and kept near the glass. The tops should be 
often stepped, and the plants must not be 
grown with too much luxuriance. 

Melons, — Temperature, from 50 to 80 de- 
grees. It is possible that the late crop is 
not quite cleaned off, to do which, give fresh 
linings, and apply a little fire heat. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature, 55 degrees. 
These are at all seasons expected. New beds 
should now be formed. The exhausted beds 
will partially recover from an application of 
tepid liquid manure. The dung for new beds 
should be well sweetened, and made up when 
in a medium state, as to warmth; attention to 
this is important. 

Musas. — Temperature, from 60 to 75 de- 
grees. The heat and moisture must be gra- 
dually decreased. Thin out the suckers to 



442 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER, 



one, in a pot or tub ; those planted out may 
have two and three left. 

Oranges. — Temperature, from 45 to 60 
degrees. These do best in rather a low tem- 
perature in winter. Little water will be 
requisite ; this should be given in the 
morning. 

Peaches and Nectarines should be kept 
exposed night and day, excepting those 
which are very late, when a little fire heat 
will be necessary to ripen the wood ; have 
the early houses pruned and washed, and 
apply a good soaking of water to the soil 
after it has been dug or forked over. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature, 70 to 80 de- 
grees by day, and 60 to 70 degrees by night. 
The heat must be gradually lowered, as the 
dull months advance. Give the plants their 
winter shift into a fresh-made bed, if the 
heat is maintained by fermentation. The 
large plants should have larger pots, using 
more charcoal in the soil than before. Keep 
out all those in fruit, and ripen them off in 
one of the late houses. 

Strawberries. — Those in preparation should 
be set under glass, or the pots turned on their 
sides to keep them from getting too wet. 

Vinery. — Temperature from 60 to 75 degrees 
by day, and 50 to 60 degrees by night. The 
early houses should be kept open and the 
vines pruned early, and washed over with 
sulphur and tobacco water. The late houses 
must have a little fire in damp weather, and 
air night and day when fine, but cut decayed 
berries from the branches as soon as they are 
seen, and keep the atmosphere of the house 
dry, with as little fire aid as possible. 

FLOWER GARDEX AXD SHRUBBERY. 

Sow nothing unless it be some very hardy 
annuals, and give these a dry and warm situa- 
tion, or defer altogether until spring. 

Plant and Transplant everything that it is 
intended to remove ; the removal of shrubs 
may be proceeded with, also bulbs, the lay- 
ing of box, turfing, &c. 

General Directions. — As autumn planting 
is generally approved, the following rules may 
be worthy of attention when considerable 
alterations are contemplated : — Lift no plants 
until ready for them, and plant the foreground 
first ; choosing the dwarf and slow growing 
plants for the front, and reserving the tall 
and fast growing for the back : give variety 
of colour and foliage, yet maintaining a unity 
of form or design : where extent admits, put 
such plants as C) 7 presses, rhododendrons, &c. 
in masses : at all times avoid crushing in a 
plant except it be to screen and stop the view 
from something out of character : give bold- 
ness to conspicuous places, prominence to 
good specimens, and by marginal undulations 



give depth to views. Have in the mind's eye 
the effect to be produced years hence as well 
as the present : strive to produce a striking 
and beautiful appearance in spring ; enhanc- 
ing it in summer ; maintaining the same in 
autumn, and adding then a new feature in the 
varied tints of the foliage ; and withal and 
principally, give freshness and grandeur in 
winter. The following plants will suit, with 
a few variations and additions : — In the front, 
Azalea, Andromedas, Boxes, Berberries, Co- 
toneasters, Daphnes, Garryas, Laurestines, 
Kalmias, Rhododendron hirsutum, Roses, and 
Spiraeas will be available : — in or about the 
middle, Arbutus, Alaternus, Aucubas, Arbor- 
vitass, Almonds, Gueldres roses, Lilacs, Mag- 
nolias, Junipers, Hollies, Irish Yews, and 
Rhododendrons; whilst the back part may be 
filled with such as Acacias, Laburnums, Lau- 
rels, Pines, Taxus, Thorns, &c. In forming 
a promiscuous collection such as the above, 
it is well to have a border in front, where 
may be interspersed many flowers, as Dahlias, 
Fuchsias, Hollyhocks, and many annuals ; 
but in forming masses of one thing, as Rho- 
dodendrons, they must have the grass or 
gravel close around them. 

Alpines. — Have these put in frames or in 
cradles immediately ; see that the drainage is 
perfect, and remove the surface soil. 

American Plants (as Rhododendrons, &c.) 
may be shifted at any time ; they delight in 
a shady place and a peaty soil, but they will 
do also in good loam. 

Anemones. — Plant now for early flowering : 
turfy loam, and rotten cow-dung at the bottom, 
suits them ; put the tubers three inches apart 
in the row, and ten between, or when spread 
over the bed, five inches apart, and about two 
in depth. 

Annuals, where they may have come up 
too thick, should be slightly thinned, and by 
the end of the month a few tw T ig gy branches, 
as spruce fir, may be struck amongst them, 
to protect them. 

Antirrhinums (Snapdragon). — Allow the 
young plants from cuttings to remain pro- 
tected until spring ; the old plants need no 
protection ; do not cut them down until 
March. 

Aquilegia (Columbine). — Transplant to 
where they are to flow T er ; they are worthy 
of being more cultivated, and will grow 
almost anywhere. 

Auriculas. — Set these into the frames at 
once, if not done ; give air freely, and water 
moderately ; suffer no cutting winds to strike 
them. 

Bulbs of every sort may be put in now 
with safety and advantage ; by strewing a 
little sand below each bulb, they lift cleaner, 
and are not so liable to damp. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER. 



443 



Calceolarias. — Lift a few of the most hand- 
some, to preserve for central or conspicuous 
places ; put them in a soil of peat, cowdung, 
and loam, equal parts, adding a little sand ; 
place them in a cool and shady part of the 
green-house or frames. 

Campanulas (Canterbury bells). — Pot off 
some of the most handsome, of such as C.pyra- 
miclalis and C. grandis ; also the low growing 
kinds, as C. garganica, C. JBarrelieri, and C. 
caipatica, &c. ; secure a good stock of each, 
and keep them in cold frames. 

Carnations may be planted out where they 
are intended to flower : pot the fine sorts in 
leaf-mould and loam, and put them in frames; 
air freely, and water sparingly. 

Clematis and other deciduous climbers must 
be partially thinned and nailed ; this will 
mature the wood more fully ; defer the final 
dressing until spring. 

Chrysanthemums. — Fill the most conspi- 
cuous beds, and where they will be easily 
protected at night ; plunge the pots. These 
in the shrubbery may be slightly protected 
where exposed. 

Crocus. — Plant in patches, or in rows 
quite near the box or edging ; a few may be 
planted in beds ; use a soil of loam, decom- 
posed dung, and sand ; put them about three 
inches apart, and ten between the rows. 

Dahlias. — Take the roots up the first dry 
day after frost ; clean, and have them all pro- 
perly named or numbered. They will keep in a 
cellar or loft, below the greenhouse stage, 
or pitted as potatoes ; perhaps it is best to 
have them covered with dry sand. 

Evergreens may be transplanted wherever 
it is desirable ; water them well. 

Fuchsias. — The choice sorts may be lifted 
and kept in the greenhouse ; cover up those 
left in the ground by the end of the month : 
it is worth trying to preserve the old shoots 
by wrapping them close with hay-bands, or 
covering well with spruce branches. 

Hepaticas. — See that they are now in good 
order, otherwise the bloom will be deficient ; 
have the ground stirred about them ; they 
look best in patches in the borders. 

Hyacinths. — Trench in a good portion of 
well rotted cow-dung amongst a loamy soil, 
which together may be about twenty inches 
deep ; plant about eight inches apart, di- 
versifying the colours ; a covering of three 
inches is sufficient. 

Jasmines and Honeysuckles. — Partially 
dress the old plants ; plant in nursery rows, or 
in their final places, the young rooted plants. 

Jonquils. — Plant in large masses, or in 
beds, in sandy loam, and rotten manure, or 
leaf-mould, two inches or so in depth, six 
inches between the bulbs, and the rows a foot 
apart. 



Irises delight in a loamy moist soil, a little 
shaded ; dig or trench in previous to planting 
a good portion of decomposed cow-dung. 

Ixias require protection from the heavy 
and continued rains ; give them a dry but not 
a confined situation, and a rich loamy soil, 
with a little sandy peat, and leaf mould. 

Mignonette. — That being kept in frames, 
must be often looked to ; air freely, and guard 
against the caterpillar. 

Mimuluses are mostly hardy; but by taking 
up a plant or two of the good sorts, they are 
more easily increased in the house ; give air 
plenteously. 

Narcissus. — Plant largely of these, in good 
strong loam, and six or eight in a patch. 

Pansies. — Pot off the rooted cuttings, and 
keep them in frames ; loam and dung, and 
good drainage is all they require. The old 
beds may be dressed for the winter. 

Picotees. — Pot off the rooted layers and 
cuttings, and put in a frame ; water very 
little, and give air daily. 

Pinks. — Plant out in nursery rows, to 
bed early in spring. 

Pinus. — Those in pots may be taken in ; 
and prepare to protect the most tender sorts 
that are planted out. 

Primroses and Polyanthuses are found to 
do better exposed than with the most careful 
pot treatment ; but those tender and beautiful 
varieties which are kept in pots should be 
freed from all dead leaves and slugs, and air 
given night and day. 

Ranunculus. — Plant in beds six inches 
apart ; give them a rich open soil, as sandy 
loam and cow-dung, well decomposed. 

Rockets will repay the attention of being 
kept from the continued rains ; those which 
have been struck should now be potted off 
singly and kept in frames. 

Roses. — See that the standards are securely 
tied, the extravagant growths shortened, and 
the very tender dwarfs taken up and put in 
frames. Preparation should be made for 
slightly protecting the tender sorts, with 
such materials as spruce and laurel boughs, 
dry fern, &c. 

Stocks. — A few may be planted out in shel- 
tered and dry situations ; but the chief stock 
must be preserved in frames, giving them 
plenty of air. 

Sweet Williams. — Plant out in masses ; and 
if in the shrubbery border, let them extend a 
yard or so in diameter ; they will grow any- 
where. 

Tulips. — Make up a bed of two feet of 
turfy loam and decomposed manure ; at the 
bottom have a layer of rotten cow-dung ; the 
bed should be well raised to make allowance 
for its subsiding. This being done, remove 
as much soil aside as will cover the bulbs 



444 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER. 



three or four inches, and plant them six inches 
apart. To keep each root in its place, it is as 
well to press in the bulb and cover it with a 
cone of soil ; have them all arranged as you 
would exhibit them, and plant them exactly 
so. Plant the common sorts in patches 
throughout the borders. 

Violets. — Give a thorough cleaning and 
stir up the soil amongst them : the chief 
store should be in frames ; these should also 
be cleaned and aired abundantly. 

VTTNDOW GARDENING. 

As the nights become cold, all tender 
plants must be taken in-doors in the evening. 
and not be returned again to the balconies or 
window sills until the morning frost is en- 
tirely gone. The supply of moisture to all 
plants should be gradually reduced ; this is 
especially necessary with such as lose their 
leaves, or are of a succulent texture ; such 
should also be kept as near the light as possible. 
"Where there is no greenhouse or pit to obtain 
a few fresh plants from occasionally, cne or 
two should be bought as wanted to fill up 
vacancies. Indeed, in large towns this would 
be the least troublesome way at all seasons, as 
few window plants will repay any but an 
enthusiast for the expense and trouble of 
keeping them through the winter. 

Bulbs, such as hyacinths, crocus, &c, 
should be placed in glasses or pots if not done ! 
last month ; and, in that case, a second lot 
should now be put in. Place those in water ! 
in a dark cupboard, or similar place, but not 
in too warm a situation, or they will start but ] 
weakly. 

Begonias must be watered very sparingly. ! 
giving little or none to such as are in or near 
a dormant condition. 

Camellias. — Water very carefully, but suf- ! 
ficiently to prevent the roots from ever being I 
dry : keep them in a light airy situation. 

Cinerarias. — Continue to shift as requisite 
until they are in convenient sized pots, and 
water regularly and rather copiously, using a ] 
little manure water about once a week, except 
the weather be very damp and cloudy. 

Fuchsias. — Gradually reduce the supply 
of moisture as they go out of flower, 
and let them go to rest. Shorten in the 
smaller shoots, and put them by for the 
winter, in a place where they will be safe 
from frost, and where they will not become 
too dry. 

Geraniums. — Those which are past flow- 
ering may receive similar treatment to the 
fuchsias, but they should not be cut. Pro- 
tect them carefully from frost, but give them 
as much air as the weather will permit. 

Jfi/rtles, and similar evergreens, should be 
kept as near the light as possible, in an airy 



place. "Water regularly, and keep the foliage 
free from dust and dirt. 

Hoses. — Such as are not in an active state 
should receive but little water, but any of 
the Chinese or related sorts which may be 
growing, may be encouraged by being placed 
in a warm situation and watered regularly : 
give air freely to all. 

Primulas. — Shift when necessary, paying 

attention to the drainage and to the watering. 

I Keep them rather close for a week or so, and 

i then give air freely when they commence 

growing again. 

Violets. — Keep these in a dry airy place, 
\ and water only so much as to keep the soil 
just damp. In potting them up from the 
| open border, use a very sandy loamy soil. 

Wardian Cases. — These may be made a 
I very interesting feature for winter decoration, 
as they may consist of single bell-glasses of 
various sizes for mosses and lycopodiums, or 
| of any larger dimensions for larger plants, or 
to suit any particular situations. Even in 
the smallest, artificial rock-work may be in- 
troduced, leaving holes in which to insert the 
plants. In addition to the plants mentioned 
above, ferns, dwarf cacti, mesembryan- 
themums, sempervivums, haworthias, and 
all the smaller species of succulent plants 
may be used ; and by judicious group- 
ing — never using ferns or such-like plants in 
the same case with succulents — many combi- 
nations of strange forms might be effected. 
At this season water must be used with great 
caution, especially to succulents. 

PITS AND FRAMES. 

The principal operations will consist in 
preparing proper protection for these struc- 
tures against frost, in airing, shutting up 
early, and in the careful application of water. 

Annuals. — Shift any that may require it 
early in the month, and get them permanently 
arranged for the winter. Give air constantly, 
by taking the lights quite off on fine days, and 
tilting them in wet weather, and at night as 
long as the cold is not severe. Water freely 
in fine weather, but reduce the quantity to- 
wards the end of the month : less water will 
be required if the pots are plunged in coal 
ashes, or similar material. 

ttalf-hardy Plants, as calceolarias, pe- 
tunias, verbenas, &c, should be permanently 
arranged, but not plunged, the great diffi- 
culty of keeping them consisting in keeping 
them dry enough in damp weather. Give all 
the air possible during favourable weather ; 
and if the frames are heated by hot water or 
otherwise, and the weather prove very damp 
towards the end of the month, a little lire 
should be lighted in the day-time occasionally, 
to dry the pits and plants, the nearest of the

latter being in the mean time removed to a 
safe distance from the pipes or flues. Great 
care must be taken in the use of water, 
especially in dull weather ; very little should 
be used at a time, but the plants should often 
be looked over. Pick off all bloom, and stop 
the shoots of any plants which keep growing, 
so as to cause them to form bushy compact 
heads ; and keep them near the glass, to pre- 
vent their being drawn. 

Forcing-pit. — Maintain a temperature of 
about 60 degrees by day, or rather more with 
sun heat ; and let it fall to about 50 degrees 
at night. Give air freely in fine weather, 
even if the above heat be not quite maintained; 
and water regularly. As this is the time 
when it is necessary to begin to force flowers 
for Christmas, the requisite plants, in proper 
quantities, should now be introduced. Roses, 
lilacs, Gueldres roses, and various other hardy 
deciduous shrubs, should be placed at the 
coolest end, and the supply of water gradually 
increased. Rhododendrons, azaleas, and other 
American plants, should also be introduced 
and kept moist. A few pelargoniums should 
also be forwarded in the same way, — taking 
care they have no green fly about them, as 
those insects soon multiply in the congenial 
atmosphere of this structure. Dutch bulbs, if 
well rooted, should also be brought in towards 
the end of the month. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 60 to 65 degrees by 
day ; and about 45 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Give air freely on all favour- 
able occasions, leaving a little on all night, 
unless the external temperature fail below 40 
degrees, or the weather be wet. 

Watering. — Let this be done in the morn- 
ing, and the syringing also, as long as the fine 
weather permits it to be done. Decrease the 
quantity of water to the plants generally, and 
avoid spilling it about the stages and floors. 

Potting. — Continue to shift any free grow- 
ing plants that may require it, being very 
careful with the drainage ; and water 
sparingly until the plants are progressing 
again. 

Soils. — Continue to take advantage of all 
opportunities to collect desirable ingredients 
for composts ; and if not previously done as 
collected, ridge up all the heaps so as to ex- 
pose as little surface as possible to heavy 
rains. 

Dressing. — Continue to clean and stake 
the plants as they are brought in, previous to 
staging them. 

Insects. — Never trust too implicitly to the 
plants being free from insects ; examine them 
often, and apply the necessary remedy imme- 
diately the intruders are detected. 



Aloes, and succulents generally, should have 
very little water, but they should not be 
allowed to shrivel, as that would weaken them 
very much, and lead to their starting into 
growth before the proper time. 

Agaves, and large succulents, should be 
treated in a similar way, receiving even less 
water in proportion, and being kept in a cooler 
part of the house. 

Alstromerias. — Keep these perfectly dry 
and cool ; a back shed, if not rendered too hot 
by a fire-place in it, will be a suitable place to 
store them. 

Annuals. — Shift such of these as require it, 
and water regularly and rather copiously. 
Stake the taller growing sorts in time, before 
they get unsightly. 

Azaleas. — Keep a few of those which 
flowered first last season, at the warmest end 
of the house ; and water regularly and very 
carefully : the main stock should be kept 
cooler, and also regularly damp at the root. 

Calceolarias. — Shift such as require it, 
and bring those intended for winter flowering 
steadily forward, using liquid manure occa- 
sionally. 

Camellias. — Keep a free circulation of air 
among the plants, and water regularly, so as 
to keep the earth moist but not too wet. A 
few of the most forward plants may be placed 
in a warmer situation, so as to excite them 
very gradually. 

Cape Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c, should 
be kept dry and cool, but if any commence 
their growth, pot them, and place them in a 
cool pit or frame. 

Cephalotus follicularis (New Holland 
pitcher-plant). — Continue last month's treat- 
ment, lessening the supply of moisture as the 
days shorten, and the weather becomes cold 
and damp. 

Cinerarias. — Shift these as they advance, 
and continue to stop such as are wanted for 
spring flowering ; water freely, occasionally 
with manure water. 

Chrysanthemums. — Stake and tie out these, 
and shift any that require it. They should all 
be got into the house, or under good cover, and 
be regularly and freely watered, using liquid 
manure about twice a week. Wherever placed, 
a complete circulation of air must be main- 
tained among them. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, as semper- 
vivum, should be kept dry, using no more 
water than sufficient to prevent them from 
shrivelling. 

Cyclamens. — Re-pot any that are showing 
signs of growth, using a compost of peat, 
sand, and loam, in nearly equal quantities. 
Put them in a warm place and water sparingly 
at first. 

Epacris. — Keep the soil regularly moist- 



446 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER. 



varying in this respect as little as possible, 
and allow free ventilation among the plants. 

Ericas. — Maintain a thorough ventilation, 
and cool temperature among the plants, 
watering with the greatest care, so that the 
roots never approach dryness on the one hand, 
or become soddened on the other. If not 
done, seeds may be sown now, and the pots 
placed on a shelf near the light ; the soil must 
be kept very regularly moistened. 

Fuchsias. — Gradually lessen the allowance 
of water, and when all the leaves are off, 
shorten the shoots so as to allow the pots to 
stand close, and out of the way ; give them 
only moisture enough to keep the stems from 
quite drying up. Plants so treated previously 
could be started into growth at any period. 

Gompholobiums, and slender creepers, 
should be very carefully attended to, keeping 
the roots just moist, and the plants in an airy 
situation. 

Hatvorthias, Apicras, &c. — Keep them on 
an airy warm shelf, giving them just sufficient 
water to keep them from shrivelling. 

Helichrysums. — Water very sparingly, and 
guard against drips from the roof, or stagnant 
water. 

Leschenaultias. — Water very little, and see 
that it passes off freely : keep them in a warm 
airy place, and guard against damp. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan lily). — Pot these, 
if the bulbs show signs of growth, and keep 
them very cool, using little water until they 
advance in growth. 

Mignonette. — Water carefully, and keep 
the plants in an airy place, to avoid damp. 
Allow the most of those trained into a shrubby 
form to grow away to flower ; a few may still 
be stopped to succeed the others. 

New Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiasas, &c, should be watered cautiously, so 
as to avoid extremes ; a perfect ventilation 
should be maintained among the plants. The 
smaller sorts should be kept as near the glass 
as possible. 

Orange trees should be got into their win- 
ter quarters early in the month, if not done 
previously. See that the drainage of all is 
perfect before they are finally arranged, and 
apply water at such a rate as to keep the roots 
regularly moist. 

Oxalis. — Keep the bulbous species dry till 
spring, and give the tuberous stemmed sorts 
very little water — only enough to keep them 
from drying up. 

Pelargoniums. — Shift where necessary, and 
stop and tie out those intended for late spring 
flowering as they advance. Water sufficiently 
to keep the soil in a regularly moist condition, 
using liquid manure occasionally to the most 
advanced plants. Keep up a free circulation 
of air to prevent spot and mould. Pot off 



well -rooted cuttings, keeping them rather 
close until their roots have taken fresh hold 
of the soil. Let seedlings have a warm situa- 
tion ; but do not water them quite so freely 
as the others. 

Primulas. — Shift as often as necessary, en- 
couraging those first wanted by applying a 
little manure water occasionally ; pick out the 
flower stems of such as are meant for late 
flowering, as soon as they can be laid hold of: 
a cool airy place is still desirable for them. 

Proteas, Banksias, Dryandras, &c. — 
Maintain a free circulation of air about these, 
and use only enough water to keep the soil 
just moist. 

Rhododendrons. — If any of these are still 
under temporary protection, house them early 
in the month : place them in an airy part of 
the house, and keep the ball of roots constantly 
moist. 

Hoses. — Prune any pillar or other fixed 
plants before the house is kept closed in con- 
sequence of the weather, so as to excite a pre- 
mature growth ; cut back to a well ripened 
bud, which will resist a closer atmosphere for 
a longer time than the more sappy extremities 
of the branches. 

Salvias. — Cut in such as are out of bloom, 
and reduce the water so as to give them a gra- 
dual rest. Keep those in perfection well sup- 
plied with moisture, occasionally using liquid 
manure, and place them in the warmest part 
of the house. 

Stapelias. — The most of these will now be 
in flower ; and if desirable to lengthen the 
period of their duration in that state, the 
plants should be slightly shaded. Keep them 
just moist, but gradually withhold water as 
they go out of bloom. 

Tropceolums. — Pot the tubers as they show 
signs of growth, using a sandy loam, with 
sufficient good leaf mould to make it rather 
light. Place the plants in a cool airy place 
fully exposed to the light ; and at once fix tha 
intended trellis, and train the shoots as they 
advance. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature, from 60 to 65 degrees by day, 
and about 50 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Take advantage of all oppor- 
tunities to give plenty of air, but close early 
in the afternoon, so as to leave the house warm. 

Watering. — Restrict the use of moisture as 
the weather changes ; and leave off syringing 
even in the morning when the weather turns 
cold or damp. Avoid making any damp about 
the floors as much as possible. 

Arrangement. — Continue to vary the group- 
ing as much as possible with the flowering 
plants ; the larger specimens are, of course, in 
a great degree stationary. Much depends on

individual taste here, both in the arrangement 
of colours and of forms ; but it is merely 
necessary to mention these points in relation 
to the surrounding objects, to see what a wide 
field is here opened for the display of correct 
judgment. 

General Directions. — Attention to the 
strictest neatness has been reiterated so often, 
and is so integral a portion of conservatory 
management, that it need only be hinted at 
here. If the weather prove very damp and 
gloomy, it will be necessary to light fires for 
the purpose of drying the house ; this should 
be done on a fine morning, when the sashes 
can be freely opened to assist in the disper- 
sion of the superfluous moisture ; but the fire 
should be done with early in the afternoon, so as 
not to leave the house too warm at night when 
shut up. Be very cautious in applying fires in 
weather when the sashes cannot be opened. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature, from 65 to 75 degrees by day, 
and 55 to 60 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Admit as much air as prac- 
ticable, having in view the above scale of tem- 
perature. Shading may be dispensed with as 
soon as the very bright hot weather is past. 

Watering. — Be careful to apportion the 
moisture to the state of the respective plants, 
whether they are at rest, or in a more or less 
active state of growth. Water and syringe 
only in the morning, slightly damping the 
pipes and floors at night. 

Potting. — Little shifting will require to be 
done at present ; and as little as possible should 
be attempted. Clean and renew the surface 
of the soil in the pots where necessary. 

Insects. — Lose no opportunity to thin the 
scale and white bug especially, if they are 
present, while the plants are dormant, and the 
shoots firm and hard, so as not to be so easily 
damaged as when in a growing state. 

Achimenes. — Dry off the scaly roots as the 
tops decay, and keep them in a comparatively 
cool place until spring. If any are still grow- 
ing on for winter flowering, keep them warm 
and rather moist, syringing twice a day to 
keep down red spider. 

Allamanda, Beaumontia, Echites, and all 
strong growing climbers, should be gradually 
brought to a state of rest, by a further re- 
striction of the supply of water, and thus be 
induced to form and perfect their flower buds. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, should be reduced to a complete state 
of rest by gradually exposing the roots of 
such as have quite lost their foliage to a dry 
atmosphere, by raising such as are sunk in 
tanks or moist ground, but not so that they 
may be too much shrivelled up suddenly. 

Aphelandras, Jtisticias, Ruellias, &c. — 



Shift such of the winter flowering plants as 
require it, using water with care, especially 
just after re-potting : others past their prime 
should be rested by the ordinary means. 

Amaryllids. — Pot only such as are really 
showing bloom, and bring them forward very 
gradually. Those which retain their leaves 
all the year should receive just so much water 
as to keep them from absolutely suffering. 

Begonias. — Encourage those in an active 
state by judicious watering and warmth ; and 
keep the dormant ones in a cool dry place. 

Burchellia. — Keep cool and at rest, by only 
supplying sufficient water to keep the plants 
from drooping. 

Cacti. — If not removed before, take them 
from their temporary shelter, and place them 
in a cool airy part of the house, giving them 
little or no water. Place a few plants in heat, 
and as they advance in growth, apply moisture 
more freely. If a succession is desirable, in- 
troduce a few to a warmer position about the 
middle, and others again at the end of the 
month. 

Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — Apply 
water only in such quantities as to keep the 
plant from retrograding, and keep up a steady 
heat. 

Clerodendrons. — Reduce the supply of 
water, and gradually get the plants to rest. 
Those in a dormant state may be excited in 
succession, so as to have some in bloom all the 
summer. 

Climbers. — Regulate such as are still 
advancing ; but endeavour to rest all by 
withholding moisture, and keeping a drier 
atmosphere about the plants. 

Daturas. — Thoroughly rest such as are out 
of flower ; and gently encourage those that 
are still in a growing state. 

Erythrinas. — Get the strongest plants into 
a state of rest if not so already, and keep them 
cool and dry. 

Euphorbias. — Keep the succulent sorts dry 
and rather warm ; and the leafy kinds dry, or 
gently growing, as the case may require. 

Ferns. — Guard against stagnant air and 
water, and keep them free of decaying leaves. 

Gardenias. — Let the main stock rest in a 
cool airy situation ; and put a batch into 
heat, to flower early. Those in flower should 
be kept cool, to preserve the bloom. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Dry off the 
tubers of the first as the plants go out of 
flower, reducing them gradually to a state of 
rest. The second should also be rested, but 
ought never to be allowed entirely to lose 
their leaves. 

Sippeastrunis, Crinums, Pancratiums, &c. 
— Restrict the supply of water as the plants 
decline, but never suffer them to lose their 
leaves entirely at any season. 



448 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR OCTOBER. 



Ipomceas. — Clear away the annual species 
as they decay, and prune the others as they 
require. 

Txoras. — Keep them cool, with merely 
enough water to prevent the roots from 
being dried up. 

Jasminums, Rondeletias, Bmnfelsias, &c. 
— Treat according to the various stages the 
plants may be in ; those in flower requiring 
an increased supply of moisture. 

Lantanas. — Bring them to a state of rest 
as they pass their prime ; and cut them in 
closely before they make new growth. 

Luculia gratissima. — Be careful in apply- 
ing water after the plant shows signs of 
decreased vitality. 

Lycopodiums. — Bring these nearer to the 
light, and in a less humid situation as the 
days draw in. 

JSIalvaceous Plants, as hibiscus, should be 
limited in the amount of moisture allowed ; 
and as soon as they have done flowering, care 
should be taken to rest them as much as pos- 
sible. 

JMci7iettias, and other tender climbers, should 
be gradually rested by shortening the supply 
of water and heat. 

3Iela stomas should be kept in a warm situa- 
tion ; and the amount of moisture supplied 
should be reduced. 

3Ielo-Cacti should be kept in a warm dry 
airy place, with no more water than to prevent 
their losing bulk. 

JSIusas. — Keep warm, but greatly reduce 
the supply of moisture. If in fruit great heat 
should be applied, gradually lessening the 
amount of water as it ripens. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher Plant). — Maintain a 
strong heat and damp atmosphere ; the latter 
can be done w r ith less water than previously. 

Nymplueas (Water Lilies). — Continue the 
resting process by shortening the supply of 
moisture about the roots, and by rising them 
partially or entirely above the surface of the 
water in which they have been growing. 

JPalms. — Reduce the temperature as the 
days shorten, but do not use so much water ; 
and have recourse to fire heat to expel damp, 
in case of long-continued wet weather. 

Tkuribergias. — Clear away the annual sorts 
as they fade ; cut in the branches of the others, 
and shorten the supply of water as they pass 
their prime. 

Vincas. — Encourage those advancing for 
autumn and winter blooming ; and forward 
others for succession. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm house for the 
Indian species, 80 degrees by day, 70 degrees 
by night ; the cool or Mexican house 70 
degrees by day, 60 degrees by night, with a 
gradual diminution as the season draws in. 



Take to fires betimes, to meet the decreasing 
temperature, but apply artificial heat \trj 
gradually, and carefully guard against any 
excess during the night. 

Ventilation. — Admit air very cautiously 
and in very small quantities, closing the 
house early in the afternoon : it is, however, 
desirable to admit some, if possible, daily. 

Watering. — Water very cautiously, and be 
careful that none lodges at the base of the 
"young leaves, as in many species the plants 
are apt to rot under such circumstances. 
Syringe very little, except where plants are 
growing ; and be cautious even then. Never 
use any other than tepid water. 

Insects. — Look narrowly after slugs, snails, 
and woodlice ; as the weather becomes colder, 
they are very apt to take to such good quar- 
ters as this house affords, and do a great deal 
of injury in a short time. 

Potting. — Continue to shift any plants en- 
tirely at rest, where it may be necessary to do 
it : but except for the really terrestrial species, 
little else seems necessary than a plain block 
of wood, or very slight basket. 

Shading may be taken off entirely, choosing 
a dry day for removing it, so that the ma- 
terial may be stored away in a properly dried 
state until again wanted. 

Soils. — Collect whatever may be thought 
necessary as opportunities occur. It should 
always be moderately dry and slightly warmed 
when used. 

Imported Plants. — Any not yet in a grow- 
ing state should be kept rather cool, especially 
those from the interior of Mexico. It will be 
better to keep such as are fresh and plump 
until the spring, than to start them at this 
time, when they would have to bear up 
through the whole winter : dryness and cool- 
ness are the conditions for maintaining them 
in a resting state. 

Aerides, Saccolabium, and Vanda. — If not 
already resting, try to get these into that state 
as early as possible, and then keep them rather 
dry and cool. 

Cymbidiums. — Any that are coming into 
flower should be removed to the conservatory, 
where they will last a long time. 

Cattleyas. — Assist these to perfect their 
growth, and afterwards remove them to the 
coolest house, and keep them dry. 

Dendrobiums. — Persevere with those in a 
dry state until they show bloom, when they 
should receive a little more moisture. 

Oncidinms. — Such as are growing should 
be kept steadily on, but do not syringe them 
much in dull weather. 

Stanhopeas. — Those which have finished 
their growth should be removed to a cooler 
situation. Supply the growing plants freely 
with heat and moisture. 



CONIFERS. THE CEDRllS, OR CEDAR. 



449 




CONIFER^.— The Cedrus, or Cedar. 



Cedrus, Barretter (the Cedar). — Deriva- 
tion doubtful, probably from Kedron, or 
Cedron, a rivulet in Syria, on the banks of 
which the cedar trees grew in Biblical times. 
— Evergreen trees. 

Cedrus Libani, Barrelier (Cedar of Leba- 
non). — Leaves tufted, straight, slender, ever- 
green, persistent, of a dark grassy colour, one 
inch in length. Cones from three to five 
inches long, erect, rather oblong, very obtuse, 
with broad, close-pressed, leathery scales. 

A tree of Syria, remarkable for the diver- 
sity of form which it assumes, frequently 
grand and towering, yet often a huge heap of 
verdure, and sometimes, indeed, sending out 
large roaming branches trailing on the ground. 
It has a depth of shade which no other tree 
possesses: it is solemn beyond any other 
ligneous object ; and, in sacred historical re- 
membrance, it is the greatest of all trees. It 
is one of those few objects which will never 
be displaced by any new comers, for in its 
better aspects it scarcely admits of any rivalry. 
It is not reserved for us of the present day to 
be the first to praise it ; for ever since it rose 
on the mountains of Syria, with its great, flat- 
tened, hawk-like wings, sharp against the 
clear sky, it was aptly pronounced to be the 
' excellency of Lebanon." There were those 
who saw it from the holy city who ever after- 
wards had loftier ideas of the God of Nature ; 
and lest any one should suppose this to be a 
mere piece of fancy, it is only necessary to 
refer to that well- chosen and fervent request 
of Moses, who had a strong desire to see the 
mount which was then so beauteously adorned 
with its cedars : "I pray thee," he says, "let 
me go over and see the good land that is be- 
yond Jordan ; that goodly mountain, and 
Lebanon ! " 



As usually beheld in this country, the 
cedar is a spreading, majestic, solemn-looking, 
evergreen tree. Even in level countries, such 
as Norfolk, many parks and pleasure grounds 
are by the aid of it invested with considerable 
grandeur. Houghton park, once the seat of 
Walpole, though as flat as a bowling-green, is 
a striking instance of this fact. Around Lon- 
don it has been planted extensively ; and 
every one who is at all concerned about trees, 
knows the many magnificent specimens to be 
found in that district. At Chelsea, Syon, 
Clareinont, Whitton, Pepper Harrow, Chis- 
wick, and many other places, it has put on all 
its characteristic beauty, equalling some of the 
famous cedars of old. But why should it be 
kept so long as one of our garden elegancies ? 
No one can object to it as a suburban tree ; 
nay, it is highly appropriate in such places ; 
but it might have been long since, at the sug- 
gestion of the landscape gardener, darkening 
many of the steep and cloudy mountains of 
the North ; such of them at least as are in the 
vicinity of residences. In the more distant 
parts of country seats, where rugged scenery 
abounds, this tree might be made to command 
astonishment and reverence where merely a 
pleasing idea is at present excited. In old 
age, and when in masses, the darkling gran- 
deur of the cedar in the neighbourhood of 
rocks, and contrasted with lighter foliage, 
reaches to the sublime, and certainly forms one 
of the most striking combinations to be found 
amongst inanimate objects. If we except the 
Highland pine {Pinns sylvestris horizontalis), 
no tree has the slightest pretension to be 
reckoned equal to it in dignifying any given 
spot ; but with some other trees, it is apt to be 
badly misplaced by the uninitiated. There is 
a scene, for instance, at Sluie, on the banks of

the Findkorn, in the north of Scotland, which, 
with a few hundreds of cedars, full-grown and 
grouped judiciously, might be made to exhibit 
a picture of sylvan grandeur, such as could 
not be anywhere surpassed ; for throughout 
that district there is every other element to 
distinguish it — wood, water, high rocky cliffs ; 
and, from some points, an almost boundless 
view. Other districts in Scotland present 
most eligible situations for the planting of this 
tree, such as the banks of the Clyde ; and 
indeed every estate throughout Britain con- 
taining uneven surfaces, presents, more or less, 
the proper sites for this celebrated object. 
Let it be understood, however, that to plant 
these trees in belts, or in common woodland 
fashion, without reference to the effect they 
may have from the chief point of view, is 
disgusting. The cedar is not by any means in- 
digenous to Britain ; and if it rise anywhere in 
masses, it is well known that it does so entirely 
by art ; it ought, therefore, to be in keeping 
with the surrounding scene — an adjunct to 
the chief object not far distant, viz. the man- 
sion. If a hill side be seen overlayed with 
cedars, one would naturally look around for 
the cause which led to this costly garnishing, 
and if none were discovered, the conclusion 
would be that their being there formed no 
part of a landscape design, but the mere freak 
of a questionable fancy. All ornamental 
planting, therefore, should have a strict refer- 
ence to the effect it may produce from the 
principal point of view. 

Independently of the intrinsic merits of this 
tree, its descent and history confer upon it a 
character which will always recommend it to 
the planter. The first account of it occurs in 
the Old Testament, from which it is abun= 
dantly evident that in Biblical times it formed 
the boast of Syria. What its peculiar effect 
was when viewed upon Lebanon can be only 
arrived at from the expressions which occur 
regarding it ; and these are certainly nu- 
merous and striking. Thus, when compared 
by David to the attainment of the righteous, 
it is said : "He shall flourish like the palm- 
tree ; he shall grow as the cedar in Lebanon." 
And again, to break this lofty and ponderous 
tree, and shake the enormous mass on which 
it grows, are figures which the inspired 
Psalmist selects in expressing the power and 
majesty of Jehovah : " The voice of the 
Lord breaketh the cedars ; yea, the Lord 
breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. He makes 
them also to skip like a calf : Lebanon and 
Sirion like a young unicorn." And finally, 
we find the prophet Zechariah referring meta- 
phorically to this tree, whilst descanting on 
the destructive operations of the Roman 
armies, under the command of Titus Vespa- 
sian, against the nation of the Jews, when the 



princes and rulers were slaughtered, and the 
city and temple reduced to ruins : " Open 
thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may 
devour thy cedars ; howl, fir tree, for the 
cedar is fallen : because the mighty is spoiled : 
howl, O ye oaks of Bashan ; for the forest of 
the vintage is come down." 

But the interest attached to this tree does 
not end with it in its living state. The fancy 
must be transported to the cedar-galleries of 
Jerusalem, in the formation of which it was 
employed to the exclusion of all other sorts of 
wood. Naturalists and commentators, it is 
true, have some doubt if our cedar of Lebanon 
be the tree referred to so frequently in the 
Bible, because the wood grown in England is 
coarse, and ill adapted, as they conclude, to be 
moulded and fashioned into those flowers and 
figures which distinguished the work of the 
temple. The difference of soil and climate, 
however, may account for all this ; it being 
well known that trees which grow very slowly 
produce timber which is closer and more 
durable than that which is taken from those 
which grow rapidly. Besides, the words of 
the Psalmist, in allusion to the righteous, 
" they shall spread their branches like the 
cedar," preclude the possibility of any refer- 
ence to a juniper. Whilst, therefore, it is 
certain that the timber employed in building 
the sumptuous temple and palace at Jerusalem, 
was of the cedar, and of the growth of Leba- 
non, there is much to favour the supposition 
that the wood usually called cedar amongst the 
ancients, and which was so universally invested 
with imperishable qualities, was some sort of 
Cypressus, Thuja, or Juniperus. 

The general impression is, that this tree is 
confined to the particular mountain called 
Lebanon. This, however, is not the case ; 
for Mr. Drummond Hay, the British consul at 
Tangier, lately discovered it on Mount Atlas ; 
and specimens of the cones and branches of 
this tree have been sent from Morocco by 
P. B. Webb, Esq. Loudon thinks it probable 
that it will be found on the mountainous 
regions of the North of Africa, which botanists 
have not yet thoroughly explored. 

As to extracting and sowing the seeds. 
The cones are ripe in November or December, 
and should then be gathered ; for in some 
districts the squirrels will eat them, or rather 
the seeds, if allowed to hang longer. 17<> 
degree of heat will cause the cones to expand, 
so as to let the seeds fall out, as in the case of 
the Scotch pine, so they should be treated in 
every respect as recommended for the larch 
cones ; that is, laid upon a kiln for twelve 
hours, and subjected to a degree of heat not 
exceeding 120° Fah. During the time they 
are on the kiln they will require to be turned 
completely over three times, that is, at nine,

twelve, and three o'clock, find then laid upon a 
hard uneven floor and thrashed to pieces. 
Where there is only a small quantity, the 
best and easiest way of getting at the seeds is 
by driving a piece of sharp iron through the. 
centre of the cone, an operation which is con- 
siderably facilitated by steeping them in water 
for a few days previously. The best time for 
sowing is the latter end of April, either in 
the open ground, or in flat pots or pans laid 
in a frame without much bottom heat. The 
soil in either case should be of a light and 
friable nature, such as will not bind together, 
and should be kept moderately and uniformly 
moist until the plants appear, which will be 
in about four weeks after sowing. In the 
beds or pans, the plants may remain for two 
years, when they should be planted out into 
rich loamy soil in the open ground, not adding 
manure at the time, but into such soil as had 
been well manured for some previous crop. 
The plan of keeping them continually in pots 
is ^ery bad, and is now being scouted in all 
the best nurseries. It is, however, to be 
remembered that, if the plants are not shifted 
at the end of every two years, they are fit 
only to be burned, the roots after that time 
becoming hard and fibreless. If treated in 
the open ground, as here recommended, the 
plants will reach the height of two feet in five 
years : those in pots, on the other hand, are 
eight years old before reaching this height. 
Plants two feet high are I*. 6d. each, and 
those four feet high are 5s. each. Such plants 
are quite large enough to be planted out where 
they are intended to remain. The plan 
adopted by the late Sir George Macpherson 
Grant, of Ballindalloch, in Morayshire, was to 
plant the cedar in woods where large trees 
were growing at from twenty to forty feet 
distant from each other. So situated, the 
cedar seems to take at once an upward direc- 
tion towards the air and light, the surround- 
ing trees discouraging any unnecessary side 
branches, which forms the great evil of these 
trees when planted in open places. 

Varieties. — The following may be distin- 
guished : — 

C L.foliis argenteis (silver-leaved Cedar 
of Lebanon.) — This variety has its leaves of a 
silvery hue, which, however, it is apt some- 
times to lose. The most perfect tree of this 
kind is on the banks of the Thames, at the 
Countess of Shaftesbury's villa, Richmond. It 
is not propagated by nurserymen. 

C. L. nana is a small stunted variety, very 
prostrate in its habit, and never reaching be- 
yond the size of a bush. Plants are sold at 
7s. 6d. each. (1846.) 

Cedrus Deodara, Roxburgh (Deodar, or 
Indian Cedar.) — Leaves in clusters, evergreen, 
acute, rigid, with a light glaucous bloom, longer 



than those of C. Libani. Cones in pairs, 
peduncled, erect, oval, four and a half to five 
inches long, and about three and a half inches 
broad ; scales broad and closely pressed, fre- 
quently covered with resinous exudation. 

A magnificent tree, well entitled to be con- 
sidered one of the princes of the vegetable 
kingdom. It is a grand object, and graceful 
as well. Standing singly, it forms a magnifi- 
cent pyramid, clad on all sides with ample 
pensile spray : in thickets, where its side 
branches are discouraged, it rises in a straight 
column to the height of 130 or 150 feet, the 
admiration alike of the savage and civilized. 
The Hindoos hold it in the greatest venera- 
tion, and throughout the elevated districts of 
Eastern India it seems to awaken in them 
some becoming ideas of the God of Nature. 
Their temples are near to groves of it, and, 
in many instances, it is not used by them ex- * 
cept to burn as incense on occasions of the 
greatest solemnity. 

The geography of this tree is fixed by tra- 
vellers as comprehending the mountainous dis- 
tricts throughout the north of Hindostan, parti- 
cularly the provinces of Almora and Kamaon, 
in Nepal, and as far as Cashmere, where the 
wood is in many cases intermixed with brick 
and mortar in the construction of houses. It 
is common on the hills surrounding Deyrah 
Dhoon, which is bounded on the east by the 
Ganges, and on the west by its mighty tribu- 
tary the Jumna ; and it is generally believed 
to prevail throughout the Himalayan range of 
hills. 

The mode now generally adopted through- 
out Britain of propagating this tree will lead, 
in the course of a few years, to the greatest 
possible disappointment. Grafted on the 
common larch, which, as every one knows, is 
a deciduous plant of humble growth, this tree 
must become very much deteriorated. Who 
supposes that the humble larch is capable of 
sending out the vast, and strong, and deep 
anchoring in the soil which is necessary to 
maintain the lovely and gigantic pyramid 
which, on a proper foundation, this tree 
would assuredly become ? The practice is a 
foolish attempt at cheating Nature ; and 
planters should be on their guard to purchase 
those only which are, root and branch, directly 
descended from the sky-crowned trees of the 
Himalaya. Our mountains will grow proud 
of such, but the mongrel tribe had better at 
once give way to the true Scotch pine tree. 
Cuttings are infinitely better than inarched 
plants ; but by far the best mode is to get 
the seeds. As elsewhere remarked, the rainy 
season, peculiar to India, commences in July 
and ends about the 20th of September, so 
that the best time to gather the Deodar cones 
is shortly after the fair weather has com-

menced, during the earlier part of October. 
In 1844, when the rainy season was over 
about a fortnight sooner than usual, and when 
the intensity of the sunshine which succeeded 
was unexampled, it was necessary to gather 
the cones three w r eeks sooner than usual, but, 
as a general rule, the first three weeks in 
October may be considered the best time to 
collect them. Considerable uncertainty pre- 
vails in this country as to the best mode of 
transmitting the seeds. Thus, Loudon states 
that the " seeds preserve their vitality when 
imported in the cones, but scarcely otherwise," 
an opinion which is very apt to mislead, for 
it is unquestionable that the cones, of them- 
selves, will not retain the vitality of their 
contents. When cones are imported, they 
should be carefully coated over with resin, 
wax, or any other similar substance, to fill up 
-the small interstices between the scales, and 
carefully tied down with cord so as to pre- 
vent the possibility of their expanding during 
the voyage. It should be remembered that, 
unlike those of the cedar of Lebanon, the 
Deodar cones are deciduous, falling to pieces 
when ripe with a mere touch of the hand ; so 
that if the precaution of tying them should be 
omitted, they will be in pieces when they 
reach this country ; and the probability is, 
that not one in a hundred of the seeds will 
vegetate. Calcutta is the sea-port for the Hima- 
layan district, and a vessel from thence will take 
about six months to reach London. A much 
safer and more expeditious plan is to send the 
seeds in small packages by the Overland Mail; 
and in this case nearly all the seeds will vege- 
tate. When the cones are collected, and the 
seeds extracted, those only which are firm and 
plump should be put up. The best way to 
pack them, is to place the clean seeds, along 
with a quantity of the chaffy wings which 
were detached from them, in a small wax- 
cloth, or oil-cloth bag, which is strong and 
excludes the air. To Calcutta, those small 
packages should be forwarded by Banghy ; 
and as the average length of time occupied by 
the Oriental and Peninsular Steam Company's 
vessels is forty-eight days, January is the last 
month in which transmissions of the seeds 
should be made. All packages should be fully 
addressed to the parties in this country for 
whom they are intended, then forwarded to 
some agent at Calcutta, together with an 
account of the contents and value of each, 
and instructions to the agent to send the 
same overland to his London correspondent, 
who will pay the expenses of customs, 
clearing, &c, and forward them to their 
destination. 

Simply as a timber tree, the Deodar is full 
of promise. Though, as already stated, it is 
held sacred in many districts, it is in others 



extensively used in the construction of build- 
ings. It has been taken from the roofs of 
temples uninjured by the lapse of several cen- 
turies ; and it may be safely asserted that its 
wood is as durable as that of the larch, whilst it 
is much easier to work, and not at all liable to 
twist and warp. A section of a trunk, nearly 
four feet in diameter, was sent by Dr. Wal- 
lich to Mr. Lambert ; and in its polished state 
it has been compared to a slab of brown 
agate.

The nursery culture of this, plant is exceed- 
ingly simple. The seeds should be sown in 
free loamy soil in April, in beds, in the open 
ground, and covered to the depth of one inch. 
The plants should remain for two years in 
their beds, when they will be fit to transplant 
into nursery lines in the usual way. The pot 
culture of the Deodar is now abandoned in the 
best nurseries ; and, indeed, all the pines are 
now treated like the common Scotch fir and 
larch ; that is, by transplanting them when 
necessary in the open ground. Plants are 
now sold at the following rates : — two years' 
seedlings, 4s. per dozen ; strong plants, one 
and a half to two feet, 45. each ; and those 
from two feet to three feet high, at 20/. per 
100. (1846.) 



THE WILD SPECIES OP RANUNCULUS. 



<\&S 



THE WILD SPECIES OF RANUNCULUS. 

The character of the genus Eanunculus is 
thus explained by botanists : — 

Calyx of five (rarely three) sepals, not 
elongated at the base. Petals five, sometimes 
more, with a nectariferous gland at the base, 
which is either naked, or covered by a scale. 
Carpels, not bursting, ovate, subcompressed 
with a mucronated apex, collected into a glo- 
bular or elliptic head. Several species are 
natives of this country, some common in pas- 
tures, and familiarly known as buttercups : 
they are mostly acrid, and when bruised pro- 
duce blister ; but this acridity is destroyed by 
drying or by heat. 

Ranunculus Flammula, Linnaeus (lesser 
Spearwort). — Root fibrous ; stem reclined and 
rooting at the base ; leaves ovate — or linear- 
lanceolate, stalked; carpels obovate, smooth, 
with a minute terminal beak. A herbaceous 
perennial, with numerous long fibrous roots ; 
the stems are creeping below, and erect and 
branching above, and grow from a few inches 
to two feet high, with numerous alternate 
leaves, which in the upper parts of the plant 
are linear-lanceolate, and at the base are ovate- 
lanceolate, with a long channelled petiole, 
dilated, and embracing the stem. The flowers 
are numerous, consisting of five roundish 
wedge-shaped, bright yellow petals : the car- 
pels are obovate, " minutely pitted with a 
small point." Flowers from June to Septem- 
ber. Found commonly in marshes and watery 
places. There are two varieties : one called 
reptans has a more procumbent stem, and is, 
altogether, smaller ; this is by some considered 
as a species : the other, called ovata, has nearly 
all the leaves ovate. The plant is very acrid, 
speedily producing inflammation and blisters 
on the skin. The distilled water is said by 
Withering to be an emetic, more instantaneous 
and less offensive than sulphate of zinc ; and 
in his opinion preferable to any other emetic. 

Ranunculus Lingua, Linnaeus (great Spear- 
wort). — Root fibrous ; stem erect ; leaves 
elongate-lanceolate, acute, somewhat serrated, 
sessile, and clasping the stem ; carpels mar- 
gined, minutely pitted with a broad sword- 
shaped beak. This is a herbaceous perennial, 
resembling R. Flammula, but altogether 
larger. The stem grows two, three, or even 
four feet high, and the leaves are sessile, and 
half embracing the stem. The flowers are 
not very numerous, but they are large — twice 
the size of those of R. Flammula — bright 
yellow, and handsome. Flowers in July. Found 
in wet marshy places, but rather rare, and 
chiefly met with in the north of England and 
in Scotland. A slight variety called major 
has the leaves broadly lanceolate. 

Ranunculus ophioglossifolius, Villars (ser- 



pent's tongue Spearwort). — Root fibrous ; 
stem erect ; lower leaves cordate - ovate, 
stalked, upper ones oblong, sessile, stem 
clasping ; carpels obliquely ovate, margined, 
tuberculated with a short terminal point. An 
annual species, with a branching erect stem 
about a foot high, throwing out whorls of 
fibrous roots from its lower joints, and bear- 
ing numerous small flowers. The whole plant 
is glabrous. The beads of fruit are large in 
comparison of the size of the other parts of 
the plant. Flowers in June and July. Found 
rarely in Jersey in marshy spots (St. Peter's 
Marsh). 

Ranunculus gramineus, Linnaeus (grassy 
Crowfoot). — Root fibrous, the fibres thicken- 
ing towards the end ; stem erect, very smooth, 
with few flowers ; leaves linear - lanceolate, 
many ribbed ; carpels obliquely obovate, ru- 
gose, with a short revolute beak ; nectary 
tubular. A herbaceous perennial, with an 
erect stem from twelve to eighteen inches 
high, branching and bearing a few moderate- 
sized bright yellow flowers, with broadly 
wedge-shaped petals ; the root -leaves are 
linear-lanceolate, of a pale glaucous green, 
and the stem sometimes bears one or two 
narrow linear ones. Flowers in May and 
June. Said to have been found in North 
Wales, but a very doubtful native. Miller 
says in 1771, "We have not yet got it in 
England." 

Ranunculus Ficaria, Linnaeus (Pilewort, or 
lesser Celandine). — Root with fasciculated 
tubers ; stem leafy, single flowered ; leaves 
cordate stalked, • angular ; carpels smooth, 
blunt. A herbaceous perennial, with numer- 
ous stems, each bearing one flower, and at the 
base several leaves which are spotted at top 
with black ; these stems grow six or eight 
inches high, and often produce bulbs in the 
bosom of the leaf-stalks : the calyx is usually 
of three pieces — sometimes five ; and the pe- 
tals are usually eight in number (but this is 
variable) elliptic-oblong, acute, of a bright 
shining golden yellow, greenish at the back. 
Flowers in April and May. Found commonly 
in woods, pastures, and shady places about 
hedge banks. It is also called Ficaria verna. 
The leaves of this plant have the reputation 
of being a useful antiscorbutic ; and the root, 
which is composed of several oblong bulbs, 
when bruised and made into a poultice, is said 
to be useful as an external application to piles. 
Withering says the young leaves may be eaten 
in spring along with other potherbs. 

Ranunculus auricomus, Linnaeus (Goldi- 
locks, or wood Crowfoot). — Root fibrous ; 
stem many flowered ; radical leaves, reniform, 
three cleft, notched, stem leaves sessile, digi- 
tate, with linear-lanceolate segments ; carpels 
downy, ventricose, with a slender hooked beak.

THE WILD SPECIES OF RANUNCULUS. 



A herbaceous perennial with numerous fibrous 
roots, and erect, branching, many -flowered 
stems, growing a foot high. The flowers are 
not very numerous, but of a bright golden 
yellow : sometimes the petals are absent ; the 
calyx is coloured, and seems to supply the 
place of petals. Flowers in April and May. 
Found not uncommonly in dry woods and 
shady places. This is a far less acrid plant 
than many of the genus. Dr. Withering curi- 
ously remarks of this plant, that during the 
season for the leafing of trees, the petals are 
wanting, two or three are produced during the 
season of the flowering of trees, and five in 
the season of their fruiting. 

Ranunculus sceleratus, Linnaeus (celery- 
leaved, or water Crowfoot). — Root fibrous ; 
stems hollow ; leaves shining, radical ones tri- 
partite with blunt segments, upper ones trifid 
with linear segments; calyx refl.ez.ed ; fruit in 
oblong heads ; carpels minute wrinkled. This 
is an annual plant, growing from one to two 
feet high, with an erect much-branching stem, 
which throws out whorls of fibrous roots from 
its lower joints. The leaves and stems are 
smooth and shining. The flowers are very small, 
and pale yellow. Flowers from June to August. 
Found commonly in watery places. It is one 
of the most acrid of our native species, the 
juice producing considerable inflammation in 
a very short time. The plant is said to be 
used by vagrants to produce ulcers, in order 
to excite compassion. Two drops of the juice, 
or a bit of a leaf or flower, produce acute pain 
in the stomach, and a burning in the throat. 

Ranunculus alpestris, Linnaeus (Alpine 
white Crowfoot). — Root fibrous ; stem mostly 
single flowered ; leaves smooth, radical ones 
roundish -heart -shaped, three to five lobed, 
upper ones, one or two, linear, or cut into 
linear segments ; calyx smooth, reflexed ; car- 
pels obovate, with a straight beak, hooked at 
the end. A perennial herbaceous plant, of 
rather a pretty character. It grows from four 
to six inches high, with an erect simple stem, 
and large white flowers, the petals of which 
are obcordate. Flowers in May. Found on 
the Clova mountains in Scotland. A very 
pretty species, and worth introducing to the 
garden, where it would succeed well on rock- 
work in rather damp situations. 

Ranunculus bulbosus, Linnaeus (bulbous 
Crowfoot or Buttercup). — Root fibrous; stems 
bulbous at the base ; radical leaves ternate or 
tripartite, the segments trifid, upper ones cut 
into narrow segments; peduncles furrowed ; 
calyx rejlexed, hairy ; carpels smooth, round, 
with a short beak ; receptacle hairy. A her- 
baceous perennial, with an erect hairy branch- 
ing stem, from one to two feet high. The root- 
leaves have dilated sheathing petioles. The 
flowers are rather large, and of a bright golden 



yellow colour ; the carpels are arranged in a 
roundhead. Flowers in May and June. Found 
commonly in meadows and pastures. "We have 
seen this plant from the downs of Sussex so 
diminutive — one to two inches high — as to be 
hardly recognisable. It is the most common 
of our crowfoots, and possesses the acridity 
and pungency common to these plants : in a 
fresh state it is very acrid, and is refused by 
cattle ; but in drying it loses some of its dele- 
terious properties, and its stimulating quali- 
ties are then useful in conjunction wdth other 
herbage ; hence it becomes a valuable com- 
ponent of hay, when not in too large a propor- 
tion. When fresh it vesicates with less pain 
than canthai'ides. 

Ranunculus hirsutus, Curtis (pale hairy 
Crowfoot). — Root fibrous ; stems pubescent ; 
cut into narrow acute segments; radical 
leaves ternate and trifid ; upper ones cut 
into narrow acute segments ; peduncles 
furrowed; calyx reflexed, hairy; earpels 
round, with one or two tuberculated marginal 
lines. An annual plant, with a more or less 
branching stem, from a few inches to two feet 
I high. The flowers are of a pale golden yel- 
low, with roundish ovate petals ; the carpels 
form a round head. Flowers from June to 
October. Found in wet meadows and waste 
ground. It is also called, R. Philonotis. Very 
variable in size : when small it is the R. par- 
vidus. and when nearly smooth it is the R. 
intermedins. 

Ranunculus re-pens, Linnaeus (creeping 
Crowfoot). — Root fibrous, from a tuberous 
base ; stem erect, with creeping scions from 
the base ; leaves ternate, three-lobed, the lobes 
trifid; peduncles furrowed ; calyx pubescent, 
spreading ; carpels oval, glabrous, with a 
longish slightly curved beak ; receptacle hairy. 




THE WILD SPECIES OF RANUNCULUS. 



455 



A herbaceous perennial, with an erect much 
branched stem, about a foot high. The lower 
leaves are stalked, with dilated sheathing 
petioles ; and are mostly marked in the mid- 
dle with a black or dark brown blotch. The 
flowers are numerous, of a bright golden yel- 
low, with roundish heart-shaped petals : the 
carpels are collected into a round head. 
Flowers from June to August. Found very 
commonly in pastures and waste places. A 
cultivated variety has double flowers. 

Ranunculus acris, Linnaeus (upright mea- 
dow Crowfoot). — Root fibrous ; stem erect, 
with close hairs ; root leaves palmately tri- 
parted, with trifid segments, upper ones tri- 
parted with linear segments ; 'peduncles round; 
calyx pubescent, spreading; carpels oval, 
glabrous, with a short recurved beak ; recep- 
tacle glabrous. A herbaceous perennial, with 
an erect stem, one to two feet high, the lower 
leaves having dilated channelled footstalks. 
The flowers are of a bright golden yellow : 
the carpels are collected into a round head. 
Flowering in June and July. Found in 
meadows and pastures, very common. This 
plant is very acrid. There are several culti- 
vated varieties ; a double-flowered one is very 
ornamental. 

Ranunculus arvensis, Linnaeus (corn 
Crowfoot). — Root fibrous ; stem erect, much 
branched ; leaves three-cleft, with narrow seg- 
ments ; flowers numerous, small ; peduncles 
round ; calyx spreading ; carpels margined, 
beaked and spinous. An annual, with an erect, 
much branched, many flowered stem, about a 
foot high. The leaves with channelled stalks, 
dilated at the base, and sheathing. The flowers 
are small, pale yellow, followed by singular 
spinous fruit. Flowers in July. Found 
frequently in corn fields. This plant is very 
acrid, and is one of the very worst species for 
cattle, but, as it usually grows among corn, 
and not in pastures, its deleterious effects are 
not so much felt as they would otherwise be. 

Rtmuncidus parvijlorus, Linnaeus (small- 
flowered Crowfoot). — Root fibrous; stems 
prostrate ; leaves roundish, heart-shapedj 
with three to five lobes, upper ones three 
lobed ; peduncles opposite the leaves ; carpels 
orbicular, armed at the sides with hooked 
prickles. An annual plant, varying from six 
to eighteen inches in height, with prostrate, 
spreading, hollow stems, and hairy leaves. 
The flowers are not very numerous, small, 
solitary, pale yellow ; the petals sometimes 
wanting ; the carpels form a round head. 
Flowers in May and June. Found in gra- 
velly fields and under hedges ; not common. 

Ranunculus hederaceus, Linnaeus (ivy- 
leaved Crowfoot). — Stems creeping; leaves 
all roundish, reniform, with three to five 
lobes, smooth ; carpels transversely rugose, 



obtuse, with a lateral ascending style ; stamens 
five to ten. An aquatic perennial plant, with 
a branching creeping stem, which throws out 
roots at all the joints. The leaves are smooth, 
somewhat fleshy, often marked with a dark 
blotch in the middle. The flowers are small, 
solitary from the axils of the leaves, white, 
with narrow petals, scarcely as long as the 
calyx. The carpels are numerous, collected 
into small round heads. Flowers from May 
till August. Found in wet places, occasionally 
inundated. It and the next, are the least 
ornamental of the aquatic kinds. 

Ranunculus Lenormandi, Schultz (Lenor- 
mand's Crowfoot). — This plant has been con- 
sidered as a variety of R. hederaceus, but 
proves to be the species here named. It 
differs from R. hederaceus chiefly in having 
its leaves all cordate, subrotund, sub-peltate, 
obovatecarpels, tipped with a terminal style, and 
much broader stipules, scarcely at all adnate. 
It has been found in several parts of England. 

Ranunculus aquatilis, Linnaeus (water 
Crowfoot.) — Stems floating ; leaves stalked, 
submersed ones divided into numerous capil- 
lary segments, spreading on all sides ; floating 
ones reniform, three to five parted ; carpels 
rugose, unequally ovate, with an obtuse ter- 
minal point. An aquatic perennial, with 
floating, obtusely angular stems, and smooth, 
somewhat fleshy, floating leaves. Flowers in 
May and June. Found frequently in lakes, 
pools, ditches, and running streams, There 
are three varieties, — that described above, 
designated heterophyllus (sometimes peltatus) ; 
contortus, with the segments of the submersed 
leaves much curled and twisted ; and panto- 
thrix, with all the leaves multifid and seta- 
ceous. This is a very pretty aquatic plant. 

Ranunculus circinatus, Sibthorp (circinate 
water Crowfoot). — Stem submersed, ascend- 
ing, obtusely angular ; leaves mostly sessile, 
all submersed, divided into numerous capillary, 
forked, rigid segments, spreading in one plane, 
with a circular outline ; carpels transversely 
rugose, laterally tipped with the long in- 
curvated style. An aquatic perennial, dis- 
tinguished by its apparently sessile leaves ; 
the flowers are white, smaller than the last. 
Flowers in May and June. Found in ditches, 
pools, and slow running streams. It is like 
the last rather an ornamental plant. Also 
called R. divaricatus. 

Ranunculus Jluitans, Lambert (floating 
water Crowfoot). — Stem floating round ; 
leaves all submersed, much forked, with elon- 
gated, setaceous, parallel segments; carpels 
transversely rugose, obovate, with a short, 
obtuse, straight lateral point. An aquatic 
perennial, differing from the two former in 
its elongated leaves, which with the stalks are 
often a foot or more in length : very rarely a

few terminal subtrifid truncate floating leaves 
are found ; the flowers are large, white. 
Flowers in May and June. Found in brooks, 
streams, and rivers, frequently. This plant 
is the It. Jiuviatilis, It. peucedanifolius, and 
H. pantothrix, of different authors. 

The three last-named species of water 
Crowfoot — H. aquatilis, It. circinatus, and 
JR. fluitans, with their varieties, are very 
pretty water plants ; especially JR. aquatilis, 
Avhich during the summer months decks the 
surface of the water with a close carpet of its 
pretty white flowers : these flowers, when 
elevated just above the surface of the water, 
are rendered the more conspicuous from the 
contrast between their beautiful shining clear 
■white colour, and the dark green of the stems 
and leaves seen beneath the water. It was at one 
time supposed that these plants were equally 
poisonous with some others of the genus ; this 
does not, however, appear to be the case, as the 
cottagers on the banks of the river Avon are 
in the habit of feeding their cattle with them. 

There is some difference between the wild 
species of Ranunculus, and the rich varieties 
of the eastern species (JR. asiaticus), which 
owe their existence to the skill and persever- 
ance of florists ; but, nevertheless, many of 
our wild ranunculuses are not to be despised, 
though they are passed by from their common- 
ness, and the want of variety in their colour. 
Looking at them with an eye unprejudiced in 
favour of any preconceived notions of beauty, 
one cannot but admit that their intrinsic ele- 
gance of habit, and brilliancy of colour, entitle 
them to much higher estimation than the 
" buttercups of the field" usually have be- 
stowed- upon them. Some of the double- 
flowered varieties rank among the handsomest 
of common perennial flowers. 

ACCLIMATATION OF PLANTS. 

Johnson, in his "Principles of Gardening," 
treats this subject as seriously as if there were 
anything in it but a chimera; as if the con- 
stitution of a plant could be permanently 
altered ; and after all it is these great theorists 
who mislead themselves first, and their fol- 
lowers afterwards. In this case there is no 
new fact adduced. The old humdrum tale 
about Aucuba japonica and Pceonia Moutan 
having been stove plants, removed first to the 
greenhouse and then out of doors, is of course 
resorted to as a presumed confirmation of the 
doctrine of the acclimatation of plants, as if 
it were fact instead of fiction. 

So far as these illusions of great men in- 
duce experiment, they are not without their 
good effects. Mr. Johnson's error lies in pre- 
suming that the mere fact of a plant from a hot 
country being grown in the open air, is indi- 



cative or proof of a change of the plant or of 
its constitution, whereas it is nothing more 
than the proof of its qualities of endurance. 
He says, " Every plant has a peculiar tempe- 
rature, without which its functions cease, but 
the majority of them luxuriate most in a cli- 
mate of which the extreme temperatures do 
not much exceed 32 degrees and 90 degrees. 
No seed will vegetate, no sap will circulate, 
at a temperature at or below the freezing 
point of water, yet the juices of the plant are 
not congealed even at a temperature far more 
depressed ; and I know of no other more 
satisfactory proof, that, like a cold-blooded 
animal — the frog and the leech for example, 
it becomes torpid though life is not extinct, 
unless excited by a genial temperature." 
Something very much bordering on our 
notions which are founded on practice, may 
be found in Mr. Johnson's reasoning, but his 
conclusions are altogether opposed to us. 
He says, " No cultivation will render plants, 
natives of the torrid zone, capable of bearing 
the rigour of our winters, although their 
offspring reared from seed may be rendered 
much more hardy than their parents." 

We quite agree with this, because we have 
shown and proved over and over again, that 
cultivation will not change the powers of en- 
durance either for heat or cold ; but the steps 
which Mr. Johnson and other writers on 
acclimatation recommend, are perfectly right 
and proper to be taken, not as they allege 
to acclimatise the plant, but to prove what 
it will endure. 

If the British oak were cultivated in a 
stove, it would no more be a stove plant for 
that operation, than a dog would be a horse 
for being kept in a stable ; but an oak brought 
up in a stove, must not be planted out from 
the stove to the open ground in mid-winter, 
because the sudden check might kill it, and in 
all probability would kill it, though it is able to 
endure intense frost when properly managed. 
Therefore all plants to be grown in the open 
air, ought to be raised in the open air, or if 
necessarily grown first in a stove, should be 
gradually instead of suddenly brought to lower 
temperature. 

Whoever can afford to lose plants, should 
try the experiment of their open air culture, 
because we may be growing in stoves and 
greenhouses many subjects that would stand 
in the open ground in our winters. As Mr. 
Johnson properly observes, "When a new 
plant arrives from tropical latitudes, it is de- 
sirable to use every precaution to avoid its 
loss, but so soon as it has been propagated 
from, and the danger of such loss is removed, 
from that moment ought experiments to com- 
mence ;" but instead of saying, " to ascertain 
whether its acclimatization is attainable" 



ACCLTMATATION OF PLANTS.

"which he does, he ought to say, to try what 
are its powers of enduring cold, because that 
and that only can have to be tried ; it is worse 
than nonsense to talk of any change in the 
powers of the plant being attained. It is quite 
right to gradually bring the plant to its proper 
trial, and not to do anything suddenly, because, 
as we have shown, the oak itself might be 
reared in a stove and grow there, and would 
be killed if changed from thence to out-of-door 
growth in mid-winter. The nature of the 
plant is not changed ; but it is the same with 
plants as with animals — remove them from 
90 degrees to 30 degrees in the same hour, 
and mischief must ensue. 

The hardening off, as it is called, of all plants 
raised in heat, for planting in the open air, is 
quite requisite on all occasions, from the com- 
mon annuals to dahlias. All are in practice 
submitted to the same process : first, by ad- 
mitting more air than usual ; then by removal 
to a cooler situation ; lastly, perhaps to a cold 
frame which will merely keep out frost ; 
although these things are to be planted out in 
our warm spring months, as the temperature 
is increasing instead of declining. 

The reasoning of Mr. Johnson is good, and 
his advice is good, for on account of the much 
greater facility for cultivating hardy plants, 
the more we have capable of enduring our 
winters the better. " Hence," says the author 
of "The Principles of Gardening," "hence 
it is very desirable that an extended series of 
experiments should be instituted, to ascertain 
decisively, whether many of our present 
greenhouse and stove plants could not en- 
dure exposure to our winters if but slightly or 
not at all protected. It may be laid down as a 
rule, that all Japan plants will do so on the 
southern coast counties of England, but it re- 
mains unascertained to what degree of northern 
latitude in our island this genial power of en- 
durance extends? This last remark is in 
character with a practical man, for in truth 
that is the only inquiry to conduct : no 
possibility of changing the power of endurance 
exists ; all we have to do is to see what 
power the plant has, and there ends our task ; 
we can then assign the plant to its proper 
station. Mr. Johnson says, " We all know 
the larch was once kept in a greenhouse, and 
within these few months, such South American 
plants as Tropceolwm pentaphyllum and 
Gesnera Douglasii, have been found to sur- 
vive our winters in our garden borders." 
Very true; but the larch was no more a green- 
house plant for that fact, nor does the mere 
fact of surviving our winters in our garden 
borders, in Scotland and Suffolk or in 
Herefordshire, prove a jot towards the two 
plants being hardy. We remember very well 
seeing Tacsonia pinnatisUpula flowering on 



Twickenham Common, in front of a cottage, 
by the side of Tropceolwm aduncum, in 
the middle of January, yet the former is a 
tender plant, whatever the latter may be ; but 
the winter accommodated itself to the plant, 
not the plant to the winter. 

A registering thermometer alone can settle 
the question, as to how much frost the plant 
endures, or whether it endures any, and the 
thermometer ought not merely to be out of 
doors in the open air, but it should hang 
where the plant is ; for we have seen the 
dahlia in full flower in one place, and cut down 
to the ground in another, not one hundred 
yards off. And then again it has to be con- 
sidered, whether a sudden change has not 
done more towards killing a plant, than the 
intensity of the frost ; for it must be ad- 
mitted that rapid changes from heat to cold, 
and vice versa, do more mischief in our 
winters than the actual cold would, if it came 
gradually and went gradually. We think 
nothing of the mere fact of plants once 
considered tender being found hardy. Mr. 
Johnson says : " Another fact is, that many 
tropical plants, of every order and species, 
have been found to require much less heat, 
both during the day and during the night, 
than gardeners of a previous century believed. 
Other plants than those already noticed 
have passed from the tropics to our parterres, 
and even to those of higher northern latitudes. 
The horse-chestnut is a native of the tropics, 
but it endures uninjured the stern elements of 
Sweden. Aucuba japonica, Pceonia Mou- 
tan, we all remember to have passed from the 
stove to the greenhouse, and now they are in 
our open gardens." 

All this is very true, but it does not show 
that the nature of the plants or their powers 
of endurance have changed one degree, or 
even a shade of one. It is said further on : 
" Then, again, there is no doubt that all the 
Coniferae of Mexico, which flourish there at an 
elevation of more than 8,000 feet above the sea 
coast, will survive our winters in the open 
air. Among them are : Pinus Llaveana, 
Pinus Teocote, Pinus patula, Pinus Hart- 
wegii, Cupressus thurifera, Juniperusjlaccida, 
Abies religiosa, and some others." 

Perhaps the learned author will some of 
these days condescend to enlighten us rather 
more upon this subject, and inform us how 
there could be any doubt. The Pinus Lla- 
veana, Teocote, patula, and Hartwegii, are 
known hardy plants, and were introduced 
from Mexico as such, and we should like to 
know how they could be other than hardy 
from a climate like that experienced at the 
top of a mountain 8,000 feet high. 

The Coniferae of Mexico require no accli- 
matizing, as it is called. There can be no 



458 



ACCLIMATATION OF PLANTS. 



doubt that they have to endure greater hard- 
ships on the mountains of Mexico, than they 
do in our ordinary winters ; but this has 
nothing to do -with the question of acclima- 
tation. We have all through maintained that 
it is impossible to alter in any plant its powers 
of endurance. The only way properly to 
ascertain a plant's powers of endurance is to 
gradually change its temperature, until it is 
placed in the open ground ; and to select 
several positions, even those of different cir- 
cumstances, as north, south, east, and west 
aspects, with a registering thermometer at 
each place. The conditions most favourable to 
a plant are those which involve the least 
change, and that change the most gradual. 
It will often be found, that when there is no 
protection, a plant under a south wall, or a 
south-west, will perish, while one in a northern 
or a north-eastern exposure will survive ; 
the one never being so greatly excited as the 
other, is consequently never subject to such 
great changes, and hence its endurance. The 
plant placed in the coldest aspect, having no 
sun to act upon its frozen juices, gradually 
thaws ; while that which is subject to the 
immediate operation of a hot sun, which fre- 
quently succeeds a frost, is often very suddenly 
acted upon. But there are circumstances 
under which plants may succeed better than 
they generally do, and among them there are 
certain conditions that can be supplied : for 
instance, gravelly bottom, good drainage, 
poor compost, shelter from the north-east 
winds, are all favourable to a plant that is 
susceptible of injury from cold ; not that 
these circumstances alter the plant, but they 
change the nature of what it has to bear. 
The gravelly bottom is always warmer, the 
good drainage always tends to the same end, 
the poor soil keeps the plant from growing 
too rapidly, and the shelter is of the greatest 
-consequence ; but if, notwithstanding all these 
circumstances, the winter is severe enough to 
overcome them, the half hardy plant that 
would go through some winters will perish. 
It will bear no more hardship, after all that 
can be done for it, than it would have borne 
without so much coaxing, because all that has 
been done only changed the hardships it had 
to go through, and not the constitution of 
the plant itself. 

But let us now consider how far, according 
to Mr. Johnson's notions, the offspring of 
tropical plants raised from seed may be 
rendered much more hardy than their parents. 
Now we deny that a seedling can be rendered 
more hardy than the parents ; although we do 
admit that seedlings may be more hardy than 
their parents. Our opinions are founded on this 
one fact : — Among plants known to be tender, 
the dahlia, potato, and some other subjects, 



something has been done in the way of seed- 
lings, and in a batch of many, some will be 
found affected by the frost more than others. 
Among brocoli, cauliflowers, and some other 
subjects, it is known that the seedlings will in 
some cases differ from the parent, — some will 
endure the winter better, some come earlier, 
some stand better, in short, it is not at all un- 
common to see a visible change in many of the 
plants. The new varieties of peas, cabbages, 
cauliflowers, brocoli, turnips, melons, cucum- 
bers, and all kinds of fruit, have been obtained 
from seed, and the constant variations to be 
found in seedlings from a known parent, show 
us distinctly that it is fair to hope that in a 
limited degree there may be a progeny some- 
what more hardy than the parent. 

"We were once going through an immense 
piece of brocoli, after the extreme hard 
winter so often called Murphy's, when, on or 
about the 11th January, there was the hardest 
frost known in England. It was as difficult 
to find a bit of vegetable alive as if every- 
thing had been burned up. On this occasion 
there were (among a wreck of thousands of 
plants, which were rotten and perished and 
putrid,) two or three plants as strong and 
healthy as if there had been no frost ; we 
remarked at the time they were valuable 
exceptions to the desolation around, and that 
their seed would pay more than the whole 
crop would have done. All that we could get 
out of the gardener was, that the family must 
have those three heads, and he could not save 
them ; and so it was, the family or some part 
of it had noticed them and ordered them to be 
cut for dinner. The gardener would have lost an 
excellent sort, or rather three excellent sorts, 
for one was completely sprouting, one a rather 
dark, and the other a white head. Here was 
evidently hardier offspring than the rest of 
the seedlings appeared to be, and we can 
hardly doubt that in every description of plant 
it is possible to obtain plants hardier than the 
parent, though not very commonly so without 
hybridizing, as it is called, that is, impreg- 
nating or fertilizing a hardy kind of plant with 
one of the tender, and so producing hardy 
plants with the principal characters of the 
tender one. At all events, there is no deny- 
ing that if seed be saved as carefully as 
possible, and seedlings raised from it, there 
will be found differences in the seedlings in 
foliage, in habit, in hardiness, and in other 
properties that render the plants more valu- 
able ; while, on the other hand, there will be 
discovered many much Avorse than the original. 
So long therefore as variation is to be found 
in seedlings, as compared with the parent 
plants, so long there must be allowed a 
possibility for some to be more hardy than 
their parents ; but we maintain that practically

.there cannot be an alteration made in the 
power of a plant to endure heat or cold. 
The same plant that has been tried down to 
the lowest degree of cold that it can bear, will, 
by gradual increase of temperature, be made 
to bear as much heat as ever it did ; and by 
the same gradual plan of lowering the tem- 
perature, it may be brought back again to 
bear all it ever did bear of cold. 

Nobody can dispute the ill effects of sudden 
transition from heat to cold, and vice versa; 
but it applies alike to all plants, hardy, half 
hardy, tender, and tropical. The sturdy oak 
would be victimized as readily as the delicate 
orchidaceous plant, by the sudden change of 
temperature, and its nature would be neverthe- 
less as little changed as if it had remained in 
its native forest. 

We admit, however, that the constitution 
of a plant may be injured, that is, that a plant 
may be got into an unhealthy state, and by no 
means sooner than by sudden change of 
temperature ; that it may, in fact, be so 
damaged as not to be recovered, but to linger 
on in ill health a considerable period, and 
perhaps eventually to die ; but this does not 
make it a tender plant, it only renders it a 
sickly one. We have seen the constitution of 
a plant damaged by excessive propagation, 
and with great difficulty some of the progeny 
by cuttings recovered, but we have seen others 
that never recovered, and their cuttings and 
layers continued the same sickly, weakly 
character that distinguished the parent ; but 
still the fact had nothing to do with the 
powers of the plant to endure cold or heat. 
A plant, whether tender or hardy, may be 
healthy, and it is on healthy subjects alone 
that we can place any reliance in the trial of 
what a plant can bear. 

The question of acclimatizing plants, there- 
fore, is only tenable if we put another con- 
struction on the word, and instead of using it 
as meaning the making of a plant more hardy 
than it naturally is, use it in the sense of 
'proving how hardy a plant naturally is, for 
such is all we can do. 

. The first Aucuba japonica that ever reached 
this country would have stood out of doors 
just as well as the last ; all that had to be 
avoided was sudden change, which no plant 
will bear. Every-day experience shows us, 
that sudden alteration of temperature is 
mischievous. If we want to force a rose or 
a,n American plant, we dare not take it into a 
hot stove at once, for they would fail; but first 
in a cold pit, then in a greenhouse, next in a 
moderately warmed pit, and lastly in the 
stove, they will do j ust as we wish them to do, 
and according as we hasten them, so do they 
come earlier ; but when they are in flower, if 
they are brought suddenly into the cold, they 



would irrecoverably fade, so that we are 
equally called upon to reduce the temperature 
gradually ; nevertheless the rose and the 
American plant will stand just as much cold 
as ever, so that we reduce their temperature 
by degrees. So much for acclimatizing. 

THE AMATEUR GARDENERS' CALENDAR. 
BY MRS. LOUDON. 

Our respect for the authoress induces us to 
hint very gently, that with due submission to 
her excellent taste in some things, we do not 
like her reasons for writing a new Calendar. 
The condemnation of other authors should be 
undertaken with caution ; and it comes with 
an ill grace from a lady whose knowledge is 
anything but unlimited, and certainly not 
practical. We have not the slightest objec- 
tion to the multiplication of Calendars ; there 
is one that will outlive them all, and contains 
more and better information than any that 
have been published since, and Mrs. Loudon's 
condemnation does not read well with those 
whose sound practical experience enables 
them to appreciate between shadow and sub- 
stance. 

" Whenever I have taken up a Gardeners' 
Calendar myself," says Mrs. Loudon, " to see 
what was necessary to be done at any particu- 
lar season, I have been perplexed, first with 
the multitude of directions that I have found, 
and next with being continually told that such 
and such things may be done at such and such 
seasons, without being informed which is the 
proper season at which each ought to be done, 
so as to have vegetables at the usual time. 
Thus, for instance, we know that peas, in 
ordinary gardens, are only produced during 
two or three months in the year ; and as 
amateur gardeners cannot be expected to have 
anything out of the usual seasons, the object 
of taking up a Gardeners' Calendar is to know 
when the seed should be sown to produce, peas 
at the usual time. Now, on taking up almost 
any ordinary gardening book, I find directions 
for sowing peas in January, February, March, 
April, May, June, October, November, and 
December, or in other words, in nine months 
out of the twelve, without any clue being 
given for an amateur to know which months 
are to be preferred." 

Now Mrs. Loudon commits a great injustice 
to all the Calendars we have seen, because, 
although we are told in them that this, that, 
or the other may be sown, there are directions 
when seeds are to be sown for main crops. 
Now this must mean for ordinary seasons, 
and before Mrs. Loudon issues another edi- 
tion, we recommend her to read Abercrombie's 
Every Man his own Gardener, and for 



460 



OLD PLANTS VERSUS NEW PLANTS. 



shame expunge the sentence that condemns 
her predecessor, whose Calendar will be read 
when modern imitators will only be recog- 
nised among waste paper as the linings of 
trunks, or in fragments as tails for boys' kites. 
There is a novelty, however, for which we 
must give credit to Mrs. Loudon, although 
supplied to her by Mr. Ogle, a professional 
gardener. It is a list of things not to be clone 
in the months, as well as the things to be clone. 
They are, as may be supposed, very learned, 
and highly flattering to that portion of the 
public who read Mrs. Loudon's Calendar. It 
is as if the good lady had anticipated that the 
readers of her " things not to be done," were 
sure to be very stupid people. Let us give a 
few of her very important cautions. 

" Never build, if you canhelp it, in January." 

"We should like to know whether anybody 
ever did build from choice, with the almost 
certainty of a frost. 

" Never water plants during the season 
when they require to be in a state of repose." 

All the Calendars are content to direct that 
we are to keep things dry, as the means of 
making a plant rest. The novelty which Mrs. 
Loudon claims the merit of is, that her Calen- 
dar, instead of saying, "You are to keep it dry," 
says, " You are not to water it :" this is clever 
and original. Other Calendars tell us we are 
to fumigate plants, and afterwards syringe 
with clear water. Mrs. Loudon says, " Never 
syringe the plants before fumigating them." 

There are two classes of cautions, the one 
merely changing the lessons of other Calen- 
dars to negatives as palpable as those we have 
chosen, and others which are almost insulting, 
even to a booby fresh caught from the moun- 
tains, cautions as absurd as if she had said — 

Never hold your hand on the fire long to- 
gether. 

Never walk into a horsepond in frosty 
weather. 

Never tie a horse's tail to his manger to eat 
his corn. 

Never lie all night out in the snow. 

These are not more palpable absurdities 
than some of the things, which, as Mrs. Loudon 
says, " require especial notice not to be done," 
while others, as we have before observed, are 
mere changes rung upon words ; they are vile 
plagiarisms from the very Calendars she affects 
to despise. Here and there, it is true, we 
discover a novelty, and it is, as a matter of 
course, an absurdity. 

" Never water shrubs during the hot dry 
weather, without at the same time slightly 
loosening the surface of the soil, and after 
watering mulching with some half-rotten ma- 
nure, or the short grass from the lawn." 

This is perfectly original, perfectly mis- 



chievous, perfectly ridiculous. It is frequently 
necessary, after the blooming season and when 
Anemones are making their growth, to water 
them freely, and if this is one of the " things 
requiring especial notice as never to be done in 
July," without loosening the earth and mulch- 
ing, why we can only say that many plants 
must go without what they want because they 
cannot get what they do not want. If Mrs. 
Loudon had produced this Calendar without 
reflecting on those so much superior, all had 
been well, and we should have merely noticed 
it as the hundredth opportunity of using up 
the wood-cuts which have done so much 
service, and let it find its own way ; but to set 
out with an outrageous attack upon standard 
works, from which one half our gardeners 
learned the rudiments of the profession, was 
calculated to draw attention to the marked in- 
feriority of the compilation. 

OLD PLANTS VERSUS NEW PLANTS. 

It is so much the rage to obtain new plants 
and neglect old ones, that we can hardly resist 
the temptation to enter the field on behalf of 
some especial plants, and deal a sly blow at 
certain rivals which have really no claim to 
a preference, but the solitary and valueless 
point — novelty. This, however, does not ap- 
ply so much to subjects raised in England, as 
to species newly imported. If we raise plants 
here, and put them forth as seedling varieties, 
they must have some property better than 
their contemporaries, or the public gets dis- 
satisfied. The rules by which even a novice, 
independent of his natural taste, may become 
acquainted with what constitutes the merit of 
a plant, are so simple, and withal (what with 
the circulation of the work in its original 
state, and the meanness of hireling copyists, 
who, for a guinea or two a-week, turn petty 
thieves of other men's ideas) so public, that it 
would be little use for a dealer to show or sell 
an inferior thing, unless he had made up his 
mind to be detected. The time for persuading 
people that a bad thing is good, has gone by. 
The fraud would only last till the plant 
bloomed, when a glance at Glenny's "Pro- 
perties of Flowers" would tell even a tyro 
that he had been deceived, even if he had not 
sufficient natural judgment to detect the im- 
position without such assistance. What we 
chiefly allude to is the importation of novel- 
ties with high sounding names and great 
character, and their distribution among no- 
velty hunters before their real merit is known. 
This, however, is not all, for there are some 
who are totally blind to all defects, if there be 
but novelty, and who take enormous pains to 
grow and show inferior things, and neglect 
good old plants. W r e remember to have 
given a guinea an inch for Correct nifa, that

is to say, three guineas for a sprig of three 
inches. Of course we grew it with great 
industry, and all the skill we were master of, 
until it flowered, and found it not so good a 
plant as C. viridiflora. We remember, too, 
a new GreviJlea rdbusta : we believe that 
was to be all we could desire in that tribe. 
It was in one respect more than we desired ; 
it grew ten feet high without the shadow of a 
bloom ; and, as it was too big for our house, 
we gave it to somebody who had more room, 
but we saw it very much increased in size 
without any more prospect of a bloom, and 
have heard no more of it. The last we heard 
was a hint that the then owner had an idea of 
making a fishing-rod of it. But these are 
only two instances of a thousand. How many 
more we could find equally disappointing is 
only worth considering if we were going to 
form a volume. 

We should like some of our novelty hunters 
to endeavour to improve old plants, instead 
of looking so assiduously for new ones that 
" they know not of." There is a field open 
for them among a very pretty tribe of plants 
— the old-fashioned geraniums ; those with 
scented leaves. The oak leaf is one of pecu- 
liarly handsome habit, beautiful scent, and very 
mean flower : produce a good flower on this, 
and there would be something to boast of. 
Others of this family, which seem to keep 
aloof altogether from the beautiful varieties of 
the scentless ones in popular esteem, would 
bear improvement ; and improvement can be 
made very easily. Let but the florist take up 
the subject, and it is done. The flower may 
not be produced as good as those we allude to, 
but the petals may be widened ; in a." few sea- 
sons the flower may be greatly advanced in 
quality, and there is something old-fashioned 
and social in saluting one of the scented plants 
by a gentle rub of the thumb and finger on 
the leaf, which imparts the aroma as if grateful 
for the salutation. 

Writing, however, of old-fashioned plants 
being neglected for inferior new ones, we can 
hardly help noticing at public exhibitions the 
grumbling of those who fancy that costly 
plants are to win, instead of beauty and skill. 
It is not long since we saw an instance of this 
at the Surrey Gardens. A gardener was 
roundly abusing the judges for partiality, and 
endeavoured to justify his censure by reckon- 
ing up the cost of his plants, and their value 
as specimens, against that of a collection that 
was placed before him ; and it served to show 
what mistaken ideas are entertained by the 
gardeners of good buyers who obtain all the 
novelties, and of those old-fashioned people 
who buy nothing, but make the gardener keep 
up the place with old plants, and what he can 
beg, borrow, or pick up. The fact is, 



that judges have no business to know the cost 
of any thing. Shows are not to try money 
against money, but skill against skill. Novel- 
ties, however, may be desirable in all families, 
and if they are not inferior to the old ones, 
they may take their place by the side of, but 
not supersede, the established florist. Which 
of the Epacris family beats grandiflora ? E. 
miniata, a bright scarlet, is, by the side of its 
crimson brother, a very beautiful object, and 
worthy of its place ; but all the other members 
of the family are, in point of habit, real grace- 
fulness, and style, inferior. Nevertheless, 
they are all beautiful. Which of all the 
hybrid Cacti beats Cactus speciosisshmis and 
speciosus ? What plant is there that comes up 
to the old Crassula, now of course honoured 
with some new name ? But people may order 
it without knowing that old neglected plants 
in abundance were to be met with. By the 
way, Mr. Ayres had a beautiful plant in his 
collection, admirably grown, and well stopped 
while young, and, therefore, produced in a 
perfect little bush. To those who had never 
grown this plant as it ought to be grown, it 
appeared a perfect novelty ; and there were 
very sagacious people who took down its new 
name, without dreaming that it was the same 
plant they had seen growing in tall gawky 
shoots, with a bunch of flowers on the tops. 
There is nothing shows the skill of a gardener 
more than the proper management of an old 
neglected plant ; and perhaps we could hardly 
do better than give a few hints on the subject. 
It is quite frightful to go into some old esta- 
blishments, and see the long-legged, bare, and 
ugly specimens of really good plants, which 
have been allowed year after year to go 
just as they liked, without so much as the 
timely application of the knife, or the luxury 
of an enlarged pot to grow in. 

Many of these subjects, like the Crassula 
we have mentioned, would hardly be known if 
produced as they might be grown under good 
management. Can any thing be much more 
showy than a finely grown dwarf bushy 
Oleander ? Yet we find them in old establish- 
ments six feet high, bare three-fourths of the 
way up, and a head just above the people's, 
with their flowers out of reach, and almost out 
of sight ; whereas there is nothing to prevent 
their being produced as bushy as a geranium 
under three feet high, with bloom at the end of 
every shoot : we can hardly fancy a more 
showy object in a collection of plants. 

The Gardenia radicans is another fine old 
plant, but its scent has procured for it a mar- 
ket reputation, and very handsome little spe- 
cimens are to be had for a few shillings ; 
but there is not a plant in cultivation more 
worthy of a place in any collection, nor that 
would more readily yield to the gardener's

skill, if he would grow up good specimens for 
show. Another plant has always heen an old 
favourite of ours, and in the present rage for 
cut flowers we marvel that it is not as com- 
mon as mignonette ; we allude to Daphne 
indica odorata, one of the most beautifully 
scented subjects we possess, and one that will 
last in bloom a considerable period. We are 
sorry to see plants of such real merit neglected 
so much, and there is no excuse for it when 
we seize upon worse things with such avidity. 
Many of the new plants are really not worth 
the room they take ; but we ought to make 
some distinction between florists and botanists, 
for the latter take an interest in subjects 
which have not a single point of merit to re- 
commend them to the florist. In botanical 
collections all things are admissible, from 
grass and chickweed to the oak ; and a new 
weed would be as acceptable to the Botanical 
Societies as a hew rose would be to the florist ; 
but for the florist there must be a good pro- 
portion of flower, and the flower must have 
some pretensions, either by its quality or its 
size, as well as its colour. A rich perfume 
will, in the absence of these, retain for a plant 
a place in conservatories and greenhouses ; 
but many subjects may be found in old esta- 
blishments, far superior to popular plants of 
the present day, but neglected until they have 
lost their character, and almost their lives. 
They, nevertheless, do outlive all sorts of 
cruelty, and occasionally give a few blooms, 
which are cut off" for the visitors, or to send 
into the house with a bunch of other blooms of 
some kind ; and few, if any, persons located 
in these neglected places take the least delight 
among the plants under glass, and perhaps 
never set their foot in any of the plant hospi- 
tals about the place. Young gardeners should 
look to this ; they should begin propagating 
some of the old things, apply to them all the 
skill they are master of, to produce them in 
the best possible state, and they w r ill have the 
pleasure of beating many of the more costly 
and less valuable subjects that are sought with 
so much avidity by those who are eager to 
carry with novelty what they cannot command 
by skill in their profession.

shaped leaves, about an inch wide, and a 
strong flower-stem producing from four to 
nine large flowers at the top ; the flowers 
slightly tubular, about five inches long, divi- 
ded into six rather spreading segments, white 
with a double stripe of dull red down each. 
A native of South America. Introduced in 
1769. Flowers in April and May. Known 
also as Amaryllis vittata (Aiton). Culture. — 
Requires a stove or warm greenhouse ; rich 
loam, good drainage, and absolute rest in 
autumn and winter ; propagated by offsets.

Dendrobium Kuhlit, Idndley (KiihTs Den- 
drobe). — Orchidacece § Malaxideae-Dendrobae. 
— This is a handsome species, allied to D. 
secundum. It has rather slender erect stems, 
furnished at intervals with oval-oblong leaves. 
The blossoms, which grow rather numerous 
and near together towards the ends of the year- 
old shoots, are in short horizontal racemes; they 
are of a pretty light rose colour, larger than 
in D. secundum, and retain their freshness 
longer than is usual in this genus. A native 
of Java. Introduced about 1845. Flowers 
in July and October. It is the Pedilonum 
Kuhlii (Blume). Culture. — Requires a hot 
moist stove ; turfy peat soil ; propagated by 
division of the plant. (212) 

Pentstemon McEwani, garden hybrid 
(McEwan's Pentstemon). — Scrophulariaceaa § 
Antirrhinideas-Cheloneas. — A very handsome 
perennial plant of dwarf bushy habit, flower- 
ing freely, and forming a conspicuous ornament 
of the flower garden. It has opposite lance- 
shaped leaves, the branches being terminated 
by a leafy panicle of large blossoms, in size 
and form resembling those of P. gentianoides, 
but of a light rose colour, with a white throat, 
and dark longitudinal streaks. It was raised 
about two years since ; and is now (1847) in 
the hands of Messrs. Young of Epsom. Cul- 
ture. — Hardy in favourable situations, but 
usually requires winter protection ; loamy 
or moderately good garden soil ; propagated 
by cuttings planted under hand-glasses. (213) 
Camellia japonica, var. miniata (ver- 
milion Japan Camellia). — Ternstromiaceas. — 
A very beautiful variety of Camellia, possessing 
the usual habit and appearance of the varieties 
of C. japonica. The flowers measure three 
inches in diameter ; they are of good shape, 
well filled up with even imbricating petals ; 
the principal part of the flowers embracing 
the outer series of petals, is of a rich brilliant 
crimson ; within them is a circlet of three 
rows of very pale rose-coloured petals, and 
the centre consists of a little tuft of crimson 
petals, giving the flower a variegated appear- 
ance, which is, however, liable to vary accord- 
ing to treatment. It is a garden mule, raised 
by Mr. Low, of Clapton, from seeds of C. 
myrtifolia, supposed to have been fertilized 
by the variety — Lady Hume's Blush ; first 
bloomed in 1847 ; it is found to be a constant 
variety and very free bloomer. Culture. — 
Requires a greenhouse ; loam and peat ; 
propagated by inarching or budding on the 
original species. (214) 

Medinilla speciosa, Blume (showy Me- 
dinilla). — Melastomaceae § Melastorneas-Mi- 
conieae. — This is a handsome erect shrubby 
plant, of four or five feet high, with twice or 
thrice forked, three or four angled branches, 
and large oval, or oval-oblong acuminate 
48 



leaves, mostly in whorls of three or four rarely 
opposite, five or seven nerved, the nerves 
beneath and the margin often red. The flow- 
ers are borne in a dense branched panicle 
forming a drooping span-long thyrse ; they 
are moderate sized, of four ovate delicate rose 
coloured petal?, and eight long curved anthers. 
A native of Java and the Philippine Islands. 
Introduced in 1846. Flowers in July. It is 
also called Melastoma eximium (Blume). Cul- 
ture. — Requires a stove ; loam and peat ; pro- 
pagated by cuttings placed in heat. (215) 
Gardenia longistyla, Hooker (long-styled 
Gardenia). — Cinchonaceas § Cinchoneas-Gar- 
denidaa. — A handsome large shrub, with large 
opposite, oval, soft hairy leaves, the flowers 
forming a large cluster or fascicle, inclining 
to one side, at the ends of shoots ; the latter 
have a slender green tube, two inches long, 
and a limb of five oval spreading segments, 
greenish without, white within ; the style is 
twice the length of the corolla, terminated by 
a large globose stigma. A native of tropical 
Western Africa. Introduced about 1845, and 
first flowered in 1847 by Messrs. Lucombe, 
Pince, and Co. Flowers in June. It is the 
Randia longistyla, (De Candolle) but Sir W. 
Hooker considers it to be a Gardenia. Culture. 
— Requires a stove ; loam and peat ; propa- 
gated by cuttings planted in heat. (216) 
Tropceolum spectosum, Poeppig (showy 
Indian Cress). — Tropoeolaceae § Tropoeoleaa. — 
A very handsome climbing plant, with slender 
herbaceous stems many feet long, and alternate 
subpeltate leaves cut to the base into six ob- 
long obtuse leaflets. The flowers are very 
numerous, axillary, with a five cleft calyx, pro- 
longed behind into a long attenuated spur, two 
upper petals wedge-shaped, lower ones cordate, 
clawed, the whole flower rich vermilion red. 
The flower stalks are red, and partake of the 
character of tendrils. A native of the Andes 
of Patagonia, near the snow line. Introduced 
in 1846. Flowers throughout the summer 
months. It has a good deal the habit of T. 
pentaphyllum. Culture. — Half hardy ; but 
very ornamental in a greenhouse ; probably the 
roots will stand outdoors during winter ; light 
loamy soil ; propagated by cuttings placed in 
heat, or by seeds. (217) 
Lisianthus acutangules, Ruiz and Pa- 
von (sharp angled Lisianth). — Gentianaceas § 
Gentianeas. — A biennial plant, with an erect 
sharp four-angled stem, of two, three, or more 
feet high, nearly simple ; the leaves are large, 
opposite, ovate-acute ; the flowers in a lax 
dichotomous panicle, growing in one-sided 
racemes ; they are between bell-shaped and 
funnel-shaped, green and inconspicuous. A 
native of various parts of South and central 
America. Introduced in 1846. Flowers du- 
ring the summer. It is also called Lisianthus

trifidus (Humboldt, Bonpland, and Kunth), 
and L. tetragonus (Bentham). Culture. — 
Requires a warm greenhouse or a stove 
in winter ; sandy peat soil ; propagated by 
seeds. (218) 

Ixora GrjFFiTHn, Hooker (Mr. Griffith's 
Ixora). — Cinehonacea? § Coffese-Psychotridai. 
— A noble shrub, of branching habit, with rich 
brown branches, and very large (sometimes a 
foot in length) oblong-ovate acuminate glabrous 
leaves, the branches terminated by large broad 
flattened compound cymes, of innumerable 
richly orange-coloured blossoms ; the cyme is 
subtended by two small leaves ; the flowers 
are salver shaped, with a very slender tube an 
inch and a half long, and four roundish spread- 
ing lobes, all at first opening orange-yellow, 
becoming red-orange with age. A native of 
Singapore, whence it was introduced to the 
Clapton Nursery, by Mr. Low, Jun. Intro- 
duced in 1845. Flowers in July. It was first 
bloomed in July, 1847, by Messrs. Lucombe, 
Pince, and Co. Exeter, who purchased it of 
Mr. Low. The late W. Griffith, Esq., whom 
the name commemorates, first gathered it at 
Mergui, and his dried specimens are in the 
herbarium of Sir W. J. Hooker. It has borne 
in our gardens the name of Ixora hydran- 
gea; form is. Culture. — Requires a stove ; strong- 
turfy peat soil, with a little gritty sand and 
charcoal ; propagated by cuttings planted in 
sand and placed under glasses, in a moderate 
heat. (219) 

Achdienes venusta, garden hybrid (beau- 
tiful Achimenes). — Gesneraceag § Gesnereas. 
— A very charming variety of Achimenes, ap- 
parently a hybrid between A. patens, and A. 
rosea. It grows about a foot and a half high, 
with moderate-sized rough ovate -serrated 
leaves, and numerous flowers from the axils, 
having the appearance of growing in whorls ; 
they are intermediate in size, and of a light 
clear purple-rose colour, very distinct and 
handsome. It was exhibited at the meeting 
of the Horticultural Society, in September, 
1847. Culture. — Requires a hotbed frame or 
stove during the earlier stages of growth ;

Pogogtxe multiflora, Bentham (many 
flowered Pogogyne). — Lamiaceae § Melisseas. 
— A small herbaceous perennial, with spread- 
ing branched stems, numerous small glabrous, 
entire, oblong, very obtuse leaves, and small 
dense terminal heads of purple labiate flowers, 
not very showy. A native of the northern 
parts of California. Introduced in 1847, by 
Mr. Hartweg, to the Horticultural Society. 
Flowers in September. Culture. — Hardy ; 
common garden loam ; propagated by division 
of the plants, by cuttings, or by seeds. (221) 



Gilia pharnaceoides, Bentliam (pharna- 
ceum-like Gilia). — Polemoniaceag. — A very 
slender annual plant, with divaricate branches, 
and much the general appearance of the Corn- 
field Spurrey. On the lower part of the stem 
the leaves are opposite, and cut into three awl- 
shaped segments, appearing like a whorl of 
narrow leaves ; the upper leaves are alternate. 
The flowers are small, pale lilac coloured, and 
grow singly on longish stalks from the forks 
of the dichotomous branches. A native of 
sandy places near the Columbia river in North- 
west America, and of New California. Intro- 
duced in 1847, by Mr. Hartweg, to the Hor- 
ticultural Society. Flowers in summer. Cul- 
ture. — Hardy ; light sandy soil ; propagated 
by seeds. (222) 

Achimenes Skinneri, Lindley (?) (Mr. 
Skinner's Achimenes). — Gesneraceas § Gesne- 
reas. — A tall growing species, with much the 
habit of A. hirsuta. It has rough hairy ovate 
deeply serrated leaves, and large rosy-purple 
blossoms, the throat and mouth of the tube 
dull orange, marked with numerous dots. A 
native of Guatemala. Introduced in 1847. 
Flowers at the latter end of summer. Cvlture. 
— Requires a hotbed or stove in the earlier 
stages of growth ; blooms in a greenhouse ; 
turfy peat and loam ; propagated by its scaly 
tubers, by cuttings, or by leaves. (223)

inches long, deeply divided into six segments, 
with a broad dull red stripe down the centre 
of each, and a green star at the bottom. A 
native of South America. Introduced in 1774. 
Flowers from May to July. Known also as 
Amaryllis vittata major (Lindley). Culture. 
— Requires a stove or warm greenhouse, rich 
loam, good drainage, and rest in winter ; pro- 
pagates readily by seeds or offsets. (224)

leaves slightly heart-shaped at the base, and 
placed crosswise on the stem ; the flowers grow 
in a paniculated raceme at the top of the stem, 
and consist of four inversely heart-shaped pe- 
tals, notched at the end, and of a light rose- 
purple colour, but of short duration. Said to 
be a native of Mexico. Introduced in 1838

NOTES ON FLORISTS FLOWERS. 
BY GEORGE GLENNY. 

The principal novelties of the last few 
weeks are dahlias ; and there have been 
several opportunities of showing in public, 
(although not exactly among the right sec- 
tion), the subjects that are to come out next 
year. So far as the early shows have been 
concerned, there has been very little that was 
at all striking, but a good deal of mediocrity. 
The general fault of the novelties has been 
want of round outline. 

The roseate or cockade outline, has pre- 
vailed to a great degree, but there have been 
two or three exceptions. At the time we write 
this, we have not made up our minds to any- 
thing, but shall merely describe a few seed- 
lings that we have ■ seen, without knowing 
whether we shall see them again or not, and 
certainly without knowing whether upon 
further acquaintance we shall recommend 
them to be grown. A few words perhaps on 
our list of last year may not be considered out 
of place. 

Berryer, Gem, Yellow Standard, MissVize, 
Lady of the Lake, Star, Rosetta, Victorine, 
Louis Philippe, Andromeda, so fully answer 
the description we gave of them, that we need 
make no remark. With regard to the Queen 
of Sheba, we are compelled to admit she does 
not, inasmuch as all the early part of the 
month she was speckled, tipped, shaded, 
blushed, and bore all manner of truant charac- 
ters ; so much so, that many who have got a 
good deal to learn as well as unlearn, before 
they ought to trust themselves to write about 
dahlias, fancied they had made a great discovery. 

We have a strange straightforward way 
of describing things as they are, and of obey- 
ing our own eyesight rather than believing any- 
body ; and when we saw nine blooms at one 
time, not one of which had the smallest indi- 
cation of colour, but were as pure a white and as 
fine a shape as we ever want to see a flower of 
the kind, we had no choice but to describe it 
as a white. There was no evidence before us 
that in the early part of the season, the lady had 
coloured too much, or otherwise spoiled her 
complexion, for when we picked the flower to 
pieces, the base of the petals indicated no 
shades of colour, and the flower died as white as 
it lived. However, it has been exhibited for a 
white, and passed for a white many times 
this season, and therefore the worthy doctor 
who expresses his disappointment in a Garden 
Newspaper, and calls upon the reader " to 
judge his astonishment at finding that the 
white dahlia wasn't a white dahlia at all," 
only proves that this, like many other flowers, 
is uncertain ; and that the writer is greatly 
astonished at a circumstance which creates no 



surprise in persons who know any thing about 
dahlias, and the uncertainty of their always 
blooming in character. 

We spoke of the flower as we saw it, and we 
have seen it this year as we saw it last year. 
It is not a white dahlia always, but it was 
when we described it, and there was not the 
least reason to suppose it was ever otherwise 
from all we saw. We have not seen it grown 
so well as it was last season, but we are writ- 
ing rather early in the month, and it may be 
like scores of other excellent and first-rate 
things — good for nothing till the cold weather 
comes. 

Goldfinder has up to this time shown 
badly, not like itself ; the outline, which was 
last year far better than any yellow, except 
Dodd's Prince of Wales, has at present been 
deficient, nevertheless, we have seen one plant 
growing, where all the flowers were double, 
symmetrical, and fine. This is very likely 
to bring up its lee way among the later 
shows. The grand test for all these things 
is the Metropolitan show, which being so 
late in the month, must be going on after this 
is printed. 

We think no more of the judgment on seed- 
ling flowers anywhere else, than we do of a 
man's praise of his own novelties. The 
packing of judges is managed to a most 
abominable extent ; and if a man who will 
swerve for nobody is proposed, some fellow 
who has laid his plans for his own benefit and 
tricked or pushed his own man in, will object, 
because an honest judge is certain defeat to 
the trickery of packing. Even if the other 
two are packed, or the other four, in cases of 
five judges, the one sound man is security 
against the deepest game the rest may be in- 
clined to play. 

At a show at Chelsea, there was enough to 
call into action all the cunning of the Fancy. 
Some man was stupid enough to propose 
money prizes for the best seedlings, and the 
society in a body was silly enough to adopt 
the proposition. It promised seven prizes, 
gave only three, and these were given by no 
means to the best flowers. The distinction of 
first, second, and third, made it infinitely 
worse ; but nobody who understood these 
matters expected anything else, and so no 
person was disappointed. It had been most 
unjustifiably rendered more important by a 
trick that we think almost unworthy of an 
enlightened age : — Letters were written to 
the members of the Metropolitan Society, upon 
prospectuses of the Chelsea Show, announc- 
ing, without the slightest authority, that the 
Metropolian Show was to be given up. The 
effect was to bring up some of the members 
who attend the principal show in the whole 
country, and it had one good effect : it showed

some who think the Metropolitan very 
arbitraiy, that there is nothing like fairness, 
unless there are persons who will carry out an 
object in spite of menaces and grumbling. 
Among the flowers we have seen up to this 
time are : — 

Samuel Girling. — Good outline. Young 
flowers inclined to quill, deep crimson, well up 
in the centre, and good eye, petals barely touch 
each other, but the flower is very promising. 
Raised at the Dane Croft Nursery, and named 
after the late owner. 

Jenny Lind. — A fancy flower of striking 
character, purple and white, petals rather 
long and ribbed, but the centre good and 
general form very fair, with colour that would 
carry through a dozen faults. Dane Croft 
Nursery. 

Shylock. — A very fine deep scarlet, good 
average outline, rather open, which gives it a 
coarse appearance; good useful looking flower. 

Queen of England. — Colour of Beauty of 
Sussex, but overgrown and therefore larger, 
eye silvery and rather loose in the state we 
have seen it, excellent outline ; upon the whole 
a showy flower. Dodds, Salisbury. 

Gem. — A tipped or edged flower, very 
pretty, about the stamp of Miss Vyse, Lady of 
the Lake, and some other light flowers, very 
showy, and the colour well displayed on all 
the petals. Oakly, Southampton. 

Nell Gtvynne. — Sulphury or primrose 
yellow, a little rosetty in the outline, sunk 
eye in the young state, plenty of petals, and it 
may come up useful. 

Belted Knight. — A curious mixture of 
yellow and salmon colour ; bold handsome 
looking fancy kind of flower, but flat in the 
centre. Keynes, Salisbury. 

"Walter Hilton. — Large bright orange 
colour, flat in the face, fairish outline, very 
double, grown too large, and very likely to be 
better if grown within a moderate compass. 
Keynes, Salisbury. 

Attraction. — An improvement on the 
Bedford Surprise, quite as richly shaded ; 
treacherous in the eye, good general form and 
plenty of stuff in it. Bunby, Stoke. 

Jenny Lind. — Yellow. 1847. Promising, 
no particular fault, general good form, and 
bright colour. 

Maid of Kent, 1847. — Every promise of 
a first-rate flower, in the way of Radziville, but 
with a rosy instead of a purple edging or tip. 
Bally of Erith. 

A Fuchsia called Globosa Carnea has been 
handed about, and being a large and graceful 
flower, with flesh coloured sepals and blood 
red corolla, it will have many admirers : the 
blooms hang upon very long footstalks, and it 
is unlike the thousand of the same colour. 

A second Fuchsia, a little like " One in the 



Ring," which has fully justified our character 
of it in the Garden Almanac, has been raised 
by the same grower ; the habit is pretty, and 
the flower much shorter, so that it forms a 
distinct variety ; it is to be called the Beauty 
of Chelmsford. 

A third is to be valued for its habit, which 
it is difficult to describe. It does not lollop 
over the pot like many, but grows upright, 
and its branches grow up first and turn over, 
so as to hang pendulous all round, like a 
fountain almost in outline ; the stems are 
wiry, the foliage small, and the plant altogether 
elegant. This is a red variety, and the most 
abundant bloomer. Mr. Turville, the raiser, 
had an idea of calling it the Fountain, but this 
was not settled. 

There were at the Chelsea Show a number 
of seedlings without any names to them ; 
some of them deserved a passing remark, but 
for want of something to distinguish them, we 
could take no notes. 

THE VERBENA AS A CLUMP PLANT. 

Nobody who has not seen this little flower 
in great profusion in beds and borders, can 
form a notion of its value as a clump plant ; 
but there are so many varieties of no value, 
and so many of bad habit, and of no describable 
colour, that before any one ventures to use it 
to a great extent, he ought to visit some nur- 
sery where it is grown in perfection, and to 
some extent. If there were no other flower 
for the borders and clumps, the verbena would, 
nevertheless, make a fine bed garden ; but it 
makes the finest groundwork in the world for 
all other beauties. There is nothing, how- 
ever, to compare with it for Dutch gardens, 
or small beds on grass, where a figure is at- 
tempted, because you may procure them of 
any height, from that of Melindres, which is 
the dwarf scarlet that creeps along the ground, 
rooting as it goes, and forming a brilliant car- 
pet of whatever figure may be designed for it, 
to the tall varieties, which grow pretty well two 
feet high, and are as profusely covered with 
bloom ; and besides this,there are pretty nearly 
all colours and shades. Those who intend to 
grow verbenas must have an eye to the object 
in view ; if it is simply to make an out-door 
garden look gay eight months out of the 
twelve, he may select dwarf bushy, and dwarf 
creeping varieties, with as many different 
bright colours as he can find ; if, on the other 
hand, he proposes to exhibit, and desires to 
cultivate only the best kinds, he must look out 
for the show kinds only, some of which are not 
of the best habit, though of the best formed 
flowers, and in selecting these he must appeal 
to the standard — round flowers,no notch, a large 
handsome close truss, bushy foliage, abundant

bloom, and get as great a diversity of colours 
as he can find ; and these plants may fill up a 
clump, or be planted between all the other 
flowers in the border, or be grown in pots or 
ornamental vases, with other perennials ; in 
all and every situation and position they are 
useful and gay, and lasting. They cut as well 
from one place as another for exhibiting, and 
grow stronger and better in the open ground 
to cut from than in pots. In Dutch gar- 
dens, when there is a geometrical figure, the 
colours should be alike in each bed, and 
according to the beds the colour should be 
uniform. If there be six beds of a form, 
which is very common, three alternate should 
be one colour, and three other alternate should 
be another colour ; and if any other beds are 
to be verbenas, let them form as great a con- 
trast as possible ; and if eight beds of a sort 
occur, let the alternate ones just the same be 
of one. colour, and the others of another. 
But in all geometrical gardens there are mul- 
tiples of the number next the centre ; if there 
are six in the centre circle, there are gene- 
rally twenty-four in the whole. The larger 
ones, nearer the outer circle, maybe anything, 
but verbenas are the best things for the centre 
ones, and scarlet and white give the greatest 
contrast. 

Very few of our nurseries have these beauti- 
ful plants in collections ; the most successful 
raiser and grower is, perhaps, Smith, of the 
Hornsey Road, who took six or seven prizes at 
the Metropolitan Society's autumn exhibitions. 
At this nursery all that are worth growing, or 
that are put forth as promising, are grown in 
collections, and a considerable number of seed- 
lings are flowered every year. It is needless 
to say that many bad ones are let out for one 
good one, and Mr. Smith's collection of all 
that were advertized by others as first-rate 
sorts is worth inspecting, if it were only to 
enable a collector to congratulate himself on 
his escape from the same infliction. Perhaps 
out of two or three score of verbenas strongly 
recommended by dealers, you may find, if 
lucky, three or four good enough to retain and 
propagate, and the rest not worth keeping. 
This is the nurseryman's drawback in all 
branches of his trade — he must buy everything 
for fear of missing a good one, and he finds 
himself with twenty worthless for one that he 
can recommend as good. The greatest fault 
in the verbena is the narrow segment and deep 
notch ; the improvement, therefore, to look for 
is in the widening of the segments, and the 
shallowing or the disappearance of the notch. 
This is not to be accomplished all at once, but 
many beautiful varieties, with very much 
widened lobes, have driven the narrow lobes 
from the field, and they will very likely, ere 
long, arrive at something approaching the 



circle, and entirely lose the notch. Many 
of the flowers are thick, and therefore last a 
considerable time in bloom ; besides which, 
the plant naturally continues growing and 
blooming for months. This is promoted by 
cutting off the decayed flowers if seed is not 
wanted, for nothing weakens a plant more, or 
hastens its decay sooner, than allowing it to 
seed. The only employment we ever care to see 
a lady engaged in, as a garden job, is cutting 
off the decaying blooms from plants when 
seed is not required, for the growth of every 
thing is greatly retarded by the swelling of 
the seed-pods or fruit, and it is a job by no 
means too masculine ; we should be sorry to 
see a female at the unfeminine labour of dig- 
ging, even with the kind of spade recom- 
mended by Mrs. Loudon, and should strongly 
suspect that any female who followed the 
directions, had been brought up in a market- 
garden, and in her time had hoed onions at a 
shilling a day ; but there is nothing unfe- 
minine or indelicate in cutting off the decaying 
flowers, that the health and flowering beauties 
of a plant might be prolonged. 

ESCULENT MUSHROOMS. 

It is a curious fact that although a consider- 
able number of species of fungi are freely 
eaten in Italy, our common mushroom, the 
Agaricus campestris, is there interdicted, and 
any specimens of it brought to the fungus 
market at Rome are sent under escort, and 
thrown into the Tiber. 

This Agaric is almost the only kind of 
fungus which is commonly used in this coun- 
try, notwithstanding that other kinds abound, 
which are decidedly wholesome, although they 
are — chiefly through ignorance — suffered to 
perish, or are regarded as so many nuisances. 
Both Russia and Italy are famous for the 
number of their esculent funguses, and for 
the quantity of them which are used as food 
both in a fresh and dried state. In both 
these countries a considerable proportion of 
the food of the poor is thus derived ; and a 
large annual amount is realized from their 
public sale. No good reason exists why this 
source of food should not be turned to ac- 
count in our own country ; in fact in times 
of scarcity, the use of fungi in this way 
would be a source of public benefit, and the 
neglect of them can therefore be only looked 
upon as a public loss. 

It may be proper to state, that all fungi 
should be used with great caution, for even 
some of the wholesome kinds acquire delete- 
rious properties when grown under peculiar 
circumstances. Some kinds are naturally very 
virulent. The edible species should be well 
masticated, as this greatly lessens the effect 



470 



ESCULENT MUSHROOMS. 



of poison. In case of mistake, it may be well 
to mention, that to relieve a patient who has 
taken poisonous fungi, vomiting should be 
immediately excited ; and then vegetable 
acids should be administered, such as vinegar, 
lemon-juice, &c. It is a safe rule not to eat 
the less common, even of the edible kinds, until 
after they hate been soaked in vinegar, which 
extracts much of their poisonous qualities 
when these are present. 

In a former part of this volume (page 420) 
Ave have noticed a recent work on the subject 
of esculent funguses, in which are described 
upwards of thirty species, most of which 
abound in various parts of this country, and 
might be turned to valuable account as a 
source of food, and especially in times of 
scarcity. We propose to notice the principal 
of these, and to point out their relative im- 
portance ; before proceeding with this, how- 
ever, it may be as well to explain the different 
terms which are used in application to the 
various parts of fungi. 

In most fungi (that is, excluding the mi- 
nute species) two parts may be clearly dis- 
tinguished, namely, a stalk, and that which 
it supports. The stalk is, in technical lan- 
guage, called the stipes; sometimes this is 
considerably developed, in other cases, it is 
almost or altogether absent, but usually it is 
present in all the larger fungi which are 
worth notice as esculents. The upper part 
of the plant, supported by the stipes, (which it 
will be remembered in the common mush- 
room, is umbrella-shaped when the plant is 
fairly developed,) is called the pileus or cap ; 
this umbrella form is not constant with all 
fungi, but the pileus is usually more or less 
spreading at the top of the stipes. At the 
base of the stipes is the volva or wrapper, 
which is a membrane originally investing the 
whole plant ; as the plant becomes elongated 
and developed, however, it bursts through 
this wrapper, leaving it at the base of the 
stipes. Then there is the velum or veil, a 
horizontal membrane, which in the younger 
stages connects the edge, of the pileus with 
the stipes ; that part of the veil which re- 
mains attached to the stipes, in the more 
advanced stages, is called the annulus or ring, 
and invests the stipes like a loose collar. 
The hymenium is that part in which the spo- 
rules (reproductive germs) are immediately 
situated ; this part varies in character in 
different kinds, and the variations bear dif- 
ferent names ; in some it consists of thin 
parallel plates, called gills orlamellas, in others 
of anastomosing veins, of contiguous tubes, of 
pores, or of conical spines on the inferior sur- 
face. The internal substance of the pileus and 
stipes, is termed the flesh. We will now 
proceed with a brief description of those 



species set down as edible, in Dr. Badham's 
work, alluded to above, adding some others, 
and giving so much of their technical dis- 
tinctions as would enable any one with a little 
attention to recognise them. 

Agaric us. — Pileus with stipes, or fixed 
by its side ; volva, none ; hymenium,, com- 
posed of straight radiating gills. 

1. A. atramentarius. — Stipes about four 
inches high, swollen at the base, piped, juicy, 
fibrous : pileus somewhat fleshy, campanu- 
late with an uneven margin, greyish, becom- 
ing light reddish brown, slightly hairy, often 
corrugated, sometimes scaly at the apex : 
gills numerous, deep with clear veins, light 
brown, the edges grey or white, free, obtuse 
behind. — This species affords a fine ketchup 
when employed in a young state. It grows 
in tufts and is extremely common in gardens 
near dunghills and in waste corners, often 
growing upon stumps of trees in such situa- 
tions. Occurs both in spring and autumn, 
but chiefly in autumn. 

2. A. campestris. — Stipes two or three 
inches long, white, solid, fleshy, furnished with 
an annular veil : pileus fleshy, dry, convex, at 
length plane, white changing to yellowish or 
brownish, subsquamose or sericeous : gills, 
free, ventricose, pink changing to deep pur- 
plish-brown : flesh white. — This is our com- 
mon mushroom, the uses of which are well 
known. The plant is frequently gregarious, 
and is extremely common, occurring in pas- 
tures and meadows, less frequently in woods. 
It is met with both in the latter part of 
the spring, and in the autumn, but most 
commonly about September. Dr. Badham 
enumerates five varieties, which he dis- 
tinguishes by the following names and cha- 
racters : — a. edulis, the button mushroom, 
which has a white smooth continuous epider- 
mis, gills rounded at their posterior end, and 
a large somewhat funnel-shaped double ring, 
free, and sometimes moveable on the stem : 
(3. pratensis, which has a duskier pileus with 
ragged margins, gills ventricose, and the ring 
sub-fugaceous, of a cobweb texture ; the 
colour of the flesh is vinous : y. silvicola, 
which has pallid gills tapering equally at 
both ends ; the stipes with a very delicate 
ring, and bulbous at the base, showing traces 
of a volva : h. anceps, the hedge mushroom, 
unwholesome ; it has a fistulose stipes, the 
pileus when young is obtusely conical, at 
maturity flat, and more or less concave in 
age, the gills lurid red, the ring firm, broad, 
reflexed and persistent ; it is, moreover, ex- 
tremely light compared with its bulk : e. bovi- 
?ius, the ox-mushroom, which is very large, 
the pileus shaggy, at first nearly white but 
when mature of a rich tawny colour, some- 
times red-brown, the gills not ventricose but 



ESCULENT MUSHROOMS.

equal at both ends, the stalk solid, attenuated 
at the very base, but thickened just above, 
and the ring persistent hanging round the 
stalk. 

3. A. castaneus. — Stipes from one to three 
inches long, light lilac, furnished with a 
delicate veil of floccose threads : pileus some- 
what fleshy, convex when young, but becoming 
umbonate in age, chestnut colour, from one to 
three inches broad : gills ventricose, light 
purple changing to ferrugineous. — This is a 
common species, growing in numerous circu- 
lar patches under shady trees, and occurring 
in summer and autumn. In a raw state its 
taste resembles that of A. oreacles, but it has 
no smell ; it is reported to be esculent. 

4. A. comatus. — Stipes four inches high 
and upwards, somewhat bulbous at the base, 
white, hollow, with a moveable ring : pileus 
cylindrical, splitting and turning up at the 
edges, white, covered with woolly scales, 
often showing the colour of the gills : gills 
numerous, free, white when young, then pink, 
and finally black : flesh thick in the centre, 
very thin at the margins. — Young specimens 
of this very fugacious species may be used 
either for ketchup or for table. It is very 
common in rich pastures, waste ground, and 
in kitchen gardens, and is found in early 
spring and in autumn. It is subgregarious. 

5. A. deliciosus. — Stipes one to two inches 
high, tapering downwards, hollow with age : 
pileus fleshy, three to four inches across, glu- 
tinous, dingy orange, obscurely zoned, the 
margin at first involute, then expanded, after- 
wards depressed : gills decurrent, narrow, of 
the colour of the pileus : flesh and juice, 
orange-coloured, changing to green on expo- 
sure. — This is called the Orange-milk Agaric, 
and is much esteemed in Italy, where it is 
exposed in the markets ; and Sir J. E. Smith, 
who met with it in prodigious quantities in 
the market of Marseilles, speaks of it as the 
most delicious mushroom known ; neverthe- 
less, others speak of it as being more or less 
acrid, though much esteemed. The best way 
to cook them is, after duly seasoning with pep- 
per and salt, to put a piece of butter upon each, 
and to bake them in a closely covered pie-dish 
for three quarters of an hour. (Baclham.) 

6. A. excoriatus. — Stipes smooth white, 
tapering upwards, three inches high, hollow, 
with a fine loose silky pith and a permanent 
ring : pileus convex, bossed, tawny, the outer 
skin tearing as the plant enlarges ; two to 
three inches over : gills loose, white, the 
edges finely serrated : flesh white. — This kind 
is nearly related to A. procerus. It is found 
under trees in the autumn, and is very whole- 
some : it makes a fine ketchup. 

7. A. exquisitus. — Stipes from two to five 
inches long, solid, whitish, furnished with a 



strong persistent collar : pileus fleshy convex, 
white or pale yellowish, mostly smooth, four 
to twelve inches broad or more : gills numer- 
ous, broad, whitish or very pale flesh colour, 
changing to deep purple-brown : flesh thick, 
white, changing yellowish on being cut, and 
in some cases exuding a yellow juice. — This 
is the largest of English Agarics, and is more 
commonly known under the name of Agaricus 
Georgii, or the horse-mushroom : one of 
these has been known to weigh 14 lbs. This 
species is decidedly inferior to the common 
mushroom ; it may be eaten in moderation, 
cooked in the same way as the mushroom ; 
and when young is sold under the name of 
White-caps for making ketchup. It is met 
with in meadows, woods, and near buildings, 
frequently in autumn. 

8. A. fusipes. — Stipes four to five inches 
high, tapering downwards, ribbed, varying 
singularly both in length and breadth : pileus 
fleshy, with large hollows and protuberances, 
dirty white deeply tinged with reddish brown, 

1 sometimes set almost parallel to the stem : 
gills free, serrated, dirty white, rusty brown 
at the edges : flesh spongy. — This species is 
frequently found in summer and autumn, 
after rain, at the foot of old oak trees, grow- 
ing in clusters. The young plants make an 
excellent pickle ; and the full grown ones are 
good dressed in any of the same ways as the 
mushroom. 

9. A. heterophyllus.— Stipes naked, variable 
in length and size, white like spermaceti, 
meshed like the pileus with minute meander- 
ing lines: pileus from four to five inches across, 
very variable in colour, the margin irregu- 
larly elevated and depressed, at first convex 
then more or less excavated towards the 
centre, mostly smooth, more or less moist, 
never scored, but marked by raised lines, 
which frequently cross so as to present a 
finely reticulated network. — This species 
grows in great abundance during the summer 
months generally. It is excellent and very 
wholesome, but there must be no delay in 
dressing it, as insects are very fond of and 
soon devour it ; the flesh being very tender, 
requires but slight cooking. 

10. A. melleus. — Stipes fibrous, enlarged 
above and below, from one to ten inches 
long : pileus dirty yellow, more or less hairy : 
gills somewhat decurrent. — This, which is re- 
commended by continental writers, is nauseous 
and disagreeable however cooked — though 
not poisonous. 

11 A. nebularis. — Stijws from two to four 
inches long, incurved at the base, firm ex- 
ternally, softer within ; pileus at first de- 
pressed convex, then nearly flat; margin at 
fii*st involute, smooth, viscid when moist, 
grey-brown at the centre : gills cream coloured,

ESCULENT MUSHROOMS. 



narrow, decurrent, unequal : flesh, thick, white, 
unchanging. — This species is called the new 
cheese agaric, from its having an odour like 
that of curd cheese. It is regarded as rare, 
appearing in autumn. The flesh is very 
delicate and light of digestion, and requires 
hut little cooking, whether broiled, fried, or 
stewed. 

12. A. orcella. — Stipes short, solid when 
young in the centre, and somewhat enlarged at 
the base, but when older from the irregular 
growth of the pileus it becomes excentric, 
often with a lateral twist towards the base : 
■pileus, irregularly lobed when mature with 
undulating borders, soft and smooth, sticky in 
wet weather; from two to three inches across, 
one side growing faster than the other : gills, 
decurrent, at first white, afterwards salmon 
colour. — This is a very delicate mushroom, 
growing amidst the grass of woods and 
pastures, either solitary or in company, some- 
times in rings ; it is found occasionally 
throughout the summer, but its proper season 
is the autumn. It should be eaten the same 
day as gathered, either stewed, broiled, or 
fried. The plant has a peculiar smell, re- 
sembling that of cucumber rind or syringa 
leaf, in which respect it resembles no other 
fungus. 

13. A. Oreades. — Stipes solid, firm, cylin- 
drical, thickest under the pileus, white, rarely 
central : pileus convex or rather obtusely 
conical, generally umbonate, irregular, one to 
two inches broad, buffish, at length nearly 
opaque white, coriaceous : gills, distant, rather 
broad, buffish white. — This is the Champignon, 
and frequently forms fairy-rings ; it is com- 
mon everywhere, and comes up in successive 
crops in great profusion after rain. The 
flavour is excellent ; but independent of this, 
two circumstances give it an additional value 
in a domestic point of view, namely, the 
facility with which it may be dried, and its 
very extensive dissemination. When dried, 
which may be effected by two or three days, 
exposure to a drying air, the champignon 
may be kept for years without loosing its 
aroma or goodness ; in fact the dried fungus 
imparts more flavour to the dish to which it is 
added, than when used in a fresh state, though 
the dried flesh is more leathery and less easy 
of digestion. The aroma is dissipated by 
over-cooking ; it should therefore be thrown 
in (to soups, gravies, &c.) only a few minutes 
before serving. Two deleterious kinds have 
been mistaken for this : — A. dryophyllus, 
which has a hollow stipes, numerous white or 
pale yellow gills, and a depressed fragile 
pileus; and A. semiglobatus, which has a very 
viscid jistulose stipes, broad gills perfectly 
horizontal to the stem, and a shining smooth 
viscid pileus. 



14. A. ostreatus.- — Stipes solid, very short, 
sublateral or often wanting : pileus smooth, 
fleshy, dark grey, then brownish, at length 
pale, plano-convex with the margin rounded 
and involute, from one to eight inches broad : 
gills, numerous, whitish, decurrent, anasto- 
mosing at the base : flesh fibrous, moderately 
firm. — This species occurs on the trunks of 
trees, both in spring and autumn, and generally 
grows in a tufted form, very rarely single. 
Withering compares the form of the plant to 
an oyster hollowed underneath. It may be 
dressed in any of the more usual ways, but as 
the flesh is rather over solid and tough, it is 
all the better if cooked leisurely over a slow 
fire. 

15. A. personatus. — Stipes firm, bulbous, 
from one to three inches high, clothed more 
or less with villous fibrillae : pileus convex, 
very smooth and shining, not viscid, from two 
to six inches broad, pale bistre : gills rounded, 
free, narrow in front, paler than the pileus. — 
This species bears the trivial name of Blewitts 
( ? Blue hats, A. Georgii being called White 
caps, and A. Oreades,- Scotch bonnets). It is 
extremely common in England, and is found 
amidst grass, growing in clusters or large 
rings, seldom appearing before October ; it is 
produced in the markets. The odour is like that 
of A. Oreades, but rather overpowering; taste 
pleasant. It is apt to imbibe moisture in wet 
weather, and should not therefore be gathered 
during rain ; at all other times it is a firm 
fungus, with a flavour of veal, like which it 
is to be dressed with savoury herbs, and the 
usual condiments, and the more highly sea- 
soned the better. 

16. A. piper atus. — Stipes solid, thick, 
white, one to three inches high : pileus de- 
pressed, becoming funnel-shaped, more or less 
waved, three to seven inches broad, white a 
little clouded with umber : gills very narrow, 
crowded, repeatedly dichotomous, cream 
coloured : juice abundant, white like milk, 
excessively acrid and bitter. — When raw this 
fungus is very acrid, but Dr. Badham states, 
that it looses its bad qualities entirely by 
cooking, and that it is very extensively used 
on the continent, where it is preserved for 
winter use, by drying, or pickling in a mixture 
of salt and vinegar. 

17. A. procerus. — Stipes long, cylindrical, 
bulbous, scaly, with a free annulus : pileus 
broadly umbonate, three to seven inches 
broad, scaly, the surface resembling shaggy 
brown leather, dingy white, the scales dark 
scurfy : gills distant, whitish, ventricose, 
remote from the stalk : flesh white, and cot- 
tony, turning to rufous orange where bruised. 
— A fine agaric, found in open woods in the 
autumn. In some of the Highland birch. 
woods it grows in prodigious abundance. 



ESCULENT MUSHROOMS. 



473 



Withering states, that when preserved in 
pickle it is very liable to run into the vinous 
fermentation. It makes excellent ketchup, 
according to Badhani. 

18. A. prunuhis. — Stipes white, solid, 
robust, somewhat irregular : pilous three to 
six inches across, thick, convex, irregular in 
shade, more or less tuberculated, cream or 
dirty nankeen coloured, paler in the centre, 
soft to the touch, fragile : gills watery, white, 
very numerous, connected by a tooth to the 
end of the stalk. — This is one of the most 
savoury of the fungi ; it has a strong scent. 
It is readily distinguished from the fungi, by 
its mode of growing in circles, the extreme 
narrowness of its gills, and the thickness of 
its pileus; it moreover appears only in spring, 
when but few species are met with. It occurs 
in pastures, and is very prolific, one ring pro- 
ducing from eight to twelve pounds weight. 
It may be prepared in any of the ways adopted 
with the common mushroom, and has the re- 
commendation of appearing in spring, when 
that is never found. It is also dried and 
preserved for use ; the fresh form is perhaps 
better than the dried, being more tender, 
but in this state it imparts a very rich flavour 
to gravies, soups, &c. It is generally dried by 
being cut into four pieces, and exposed for 
some days to dry air, and is then threaded. 
This fungus is much prized in Italy, where it 
is extensively dried, and sold on strings. 

19. A. ruber. — Stipes short, brittle, white 
blotched with purple stains : pileus rather 
fleshy, hemispherical, afterwards obtusely con- 
vex and subsequently depressed, dry in dry 
weather, sticky in moist weather, of various 
hues — tawny, purple, olive green, ochraceous 
yellow, and several of these united : gills 
fragile, thick and broad, cream coloured, con- 
nected below by transverse veins : flesh 
tender, white, slightly rufescent when cut. — 
This species grows abundantly in woods, from 
July till a late period in autumn. A. alutaceus 
and A. emeticus, two allied acrid kinds, 
may be distinguished from this — the former 
by its buff gills and pungent acridity, the 
latter by its snow-white gills, and extreme 
acrimony. 

20. A. rubescens. — Stipes bulbous, some- 
times scaly, at first stuffed, subsequently hol- 
low with a wide ring marked with stria? ; 
ptileus convex, covered with various sized 
warts, and with even margins : gills atten- 
uated behind : flesh turning obscurely red, 
when cut or bruised. — This species grows in 
woods, in considerable abundance, both in 
summer and autumn. It is very delicate, and 
makes excellent ketchup. 

21. A. vaginatus. — Stipes six inches high 
or more, attenuated upwards, with a volva 
adnate to its base, closely surrounding it 



above as in a sheath, hollow, or stuffed with 
fine cottony fibres : pileus four inches or 
more broad, fleshy, plane slightly depressed 
in the centre, furrowed at the margin, viscid 
when moist, beautifully glossy when dry ; 
gills free, white, ventricose, broadest in front. 
— This occurs not uncommonly in woods and 
pastures from August to October. Being 
delicate and tender, it must not be over- 
dressed. 

22. A. violaceus. — Stipes about four inches 
high, minutely downy, grey tinged with vio- 
let, with a fugaceous veil of fine threads: 
pileus four to six inches broad, obtuse, deep 
violet coloured, covered with soft hairs ; gills 
deep violet changing to tawny ; flesh thick 
and juicy. — It occurs, but not very commonly, 
in the autumn, in woods, particularly under 
pine and fir trees. It may be dressed either 
with a white or brown sauce. 

23. A virescens. — Stipes short, compact, 
stuffed with cottony fibres : pileus flatly con- 
vex, then depressed, whitish, dry, coated 
over with a thick stratum of opaque meal, 
which gradually breaking up as the pileus 
expands, maps it in a singular manner with 
a series of polygonal figures : gills very brit- 
tle, white. — This fungus is very delicate, but 
not common in England. It is best cooked 
on the gridiron. 

24. A. virgineus. — Stipes white, tapering 
downwards, hollow : pileus white, one or two 
inches broad ; margin involute when young, 
then expanded, depressed in the centre : gills 
white, deep connected with veins. — This is a 
small but graceful little Agaric, of pleasant 
taste, but disagreeable odour : they grow in 
pasture?, and are common in autumn. 

25. A. uhnarius. — Stipes thick solic elastic, 
downy at the base : pileus dirty white, turn- 
ing to pale rusty, more or less orbicular : gills 
yellowish, broad, thick, ventricose : flesh 
white, compact. — This species grows on the 
elm, and is met with rarely in the autumn. 
The taste and smell are agreeable : it dries 
well, and may be kept for a long time without 
spoiling. 

Boletus. — Pileus always with a central 
stipes : hymenium tubular, the tubes separ- 
able from the substance of the pileus, and 
from each other. 

26. B. edulis. — Stipes thick, four to six 
inches long, reticulated : pileus convex, from 
six to seven inches across ; smooth, yellow or 
brown : tubes nearly free, roundish, minute, 
whitish, at length yellowish : Jlesh white, not 
changing colour. — This Boletus is frequent in 
woods, in the autumn. Its tender and juicy 
flesh, and delicate and sapid flavour, strongly 
recommend it. Mr. Berkeley says, that 
" though much neglected, it appears to be 
a most valuable article of food, resembling in 



474 



ESCULENT MUSHROOMS. 



taste the common mushroom, and quite as 
delicate ; moreover it abounds in seasons 
when the common mushroom is not to be 
found in any quantity." 

27. B. scaber. — Stipes four to six inches 
long, firm, attenuated above, scabrous : pileus 
two to five inches broad, convex, glabrous, 
humid, somewhat glutinous, of various colours 
— orange-red, brownish, olivaceous, livid, or 
dark grey : tubes free, round, whitish : flesh 
thick and flabby, white, sometimes turning 
blackish. — This fungus abounds in woods 
and shaded fields in the summer and autumn. 
When cooked in the same way as B. edulis it 
has an agreeable flavour ; but being more 
viscid in substance, it requires when stewed 
to be thinned with water : when dried it 
loses all odour, and is then insipid and unfit 
for food. Boletus luridus, a poisonous species, 
has the tubes yellow, and the flesh yellowish, 
instantly changing to blue. 

Caxtharellus. — Hymenium veined : 
veins dichotomous subparallel, sometimes an- 
astomosing. 

28. C. cibarius. — Stipes one to two inches 
long, solid, attenuated at the base, of the 
same colour as the pileus : pileus fleshy, 
irregular, smooth, two to four inches broad, 
yolk-of-egg yellow, but varying in shade : 

flesh white, fibrous, dense, scentless when 
recent, but in a few hours smelling like ripe 
apricots ; when raw it has the pungent taste 
of pepper. — It is found under trees, and in 
the borders of fields, growing sometimes spo- 
radically, sometimes in circles or segments of 
a circle, and may be found from June to 
October. At first it assumes the shape of a 
minute cone ; next, in consequence of the 
rolling in of the margin, the pileus is almost 
spherical, but as this unfolds it becomes 
hemispherical, then flat, and at length irregu- 
lar and depressed. Being naturally rather 
dry and tough, this fungus requires a con- 
siderable quantity of fluid sauce to cook it 
properly : perhaps it is best when minced and 
stewed ; it requires to be gently stewed for a 
long time to make it tender. The common 
people in Italy dry, or pickle, or keep it in 
oil for winter use. The quantity of this 
fungus which is produced is sometimes im- 
mense. It is called the Chantarelle. 

Clayaria. — Plants carnose, cylindrical, 
simple or branched : hymenium smooth, oc- 
cupying almost the whole surface, confluent 
with the stipes. 

29. C coralloides. — Plants white, two 
to four inches high, with erect stipes, and 
elongated, irregular, unequal, mostly acute 
branches. Sometimes violet coloured at the 
base. — This is the most abundant species ; it 
is found on the ground in shady places, and 
after much rain generally in the autumn. 



30. C. grisea. — Plant one to four inches 
high, cinereous, often Avith a bluish tinge, 
with thick short stipes, and unequally incras- 
sated, rugose branches. — It is frequent on the 
ground, in woods, or among grass, in moist or 
shaded places. 

31. C. cristata. — Plant one to three inches 
high, white or cinereous, tufted, branched, 
smooth, the branches dilated at the summit. 
— This is found in woods in the autumn. 

32. C. rugosa. — Plant one to three inches 
high, white, solid, but hollow in old plants ; 
thickened, or club-shaped ; simple, or divided 
into a few obtuse unequal branches. — Com- 
mon in the autumn on the ground in woods, 
and in moist shady places. 

The Clavarias enter more or less largely 
into the supplies of the. Italian markets. Dr. 
Badham gives the following mode of dressing 
them : — Having thoroughly cleansed away 
the earth, which is ap 1 : to adhere to them, they 
are to be sweated with a little butter, over a 
slow fire ; afterwards to be strained, then 
(throwing away the liquor) to be replaced to 
stew for an hour with salt, pepper, chopped 
cloves and parsley, moistening with plain 
stock, and dredging with flour occasionally. 
When sufficiently cooked, to be thickened 
with yolks of eggs and cream. The sauce- 
pan should be covered with a sheet of paper 
under the lid, which keeps the Clavarias 
white, and also preserves their flavour. 

Fistulina. — Hymenium formed of a dis- 
tinct substance, but concrete with the fibres 
of the pileus : tubes at first wart-like, some- 
what remote, radiate-fimbriate, closed, at 
length approximated, elongated, open. 

33. F. hepatica. — Pileus confluent with 
the stalk ; at first studded on the upper side 
with minute papilke, which afterwards disap- 
pear : tubes continuous with the flesh of the 
receptacle, unequal, short, small; at first with 
closed pores, but becoming spreading ; co- 
lour at first a dusky white, afterwards yel- 
lowish red ; the whole surface more or less 
sticky ; flesh succulent, fibrous, like beet-root 
in appearance, with a vinous smell, and a slight 
acid taste. — The Fistulina grows on trees, 
principally oaks, and may be found abund- 
antly throughout the summer months. It 
varies in size from that of a small kidney to 
an irregular mass of many pounds weight, 
and of several feet in circumference. No 
fungus yeilds a richer gravy ; and though 
rather tough when grilled, it is scarcely to be 
distinguished from broiled meat. The best 
way to dress it if old, is to stew it down for 
stock and reject the flesh ; but if young it 
may be eaten in substance, plain or with 
minced meat. 

Helvella. — Pileus submembranaceous, 
irregular, smooth on each surface, deflexed 



EVERGREEN STANDARD TREES. 



at the sides : hymenium occupying the whole 
outer surface. 

34. H. crispa. — Stipes fistulose, deeply 
pitted and ribbed, three to five inches high, 
snowy white : pileus whitish, flesh coloured, 
deflexed, lobed, crisped. 

35. Tl. lacunosa. — Stipes fistulose, pitted 
and ribbed, white or dusky : pileus inflated, 
cinereous, lobed, the lobes deflexed, adnate. 

These Helvellas are found in woods, or 
on the stumps of old trees ; the former being 
more common, and also preferable to the 
latter. They have all an agreeable odour, 
and bear a general resemblance in flavour 
to the morel. 

Hydnum. — Hymenium, consisting of soft 
subulate spines. 

36. H. repandum. — Stipes one to two 
inches long ; thick, unequal, expanding into 
the pileus : pileus irregular, repand, sometimes 
almost lobed, two to six inches broad, tawny 
red, smooth, brittle. Subulate processes un- 
equal, pale, mostly entire : flesh pale, not 
changing. — Frequent in woods in the autumn; 
sometimes growing solitary, but more fre- 
quently gregariously and in rings. In Italy 
it is sold promiscuously with the Chanta- 
relle, ( Cantharellus cibarius,) which it resem- 
bles. It should be well cooked with plenty 
of sauce : when well stewed it is an excel- 
lent dish, with a slight flavour of oysters. 

Lycoperdon. — Sporangium globose : 
peridium single membranaceous, scaly with 
warts or soft spines, bursting irregularly at 
the apex, and containing a mass of sporules 
and filaments. 

37. L. plumbeum. — Globose, when full 
grown as large as a walnut ; with two cover- 
ings, the outer white, loosely membranaceous 
and fragile ; the inner (peridium) tenaceous, 
smooth, grey-lead colour externally, more or 
less shaggy internally. — Abounds in dry 
places in spring, summer, and autumn. 

38. jL. bovista. — Turbinate, three to four 
inches broad, whitish, plicate beneath, scales 
broad, often indistinct. — It occurs in pastures 
in the autumn. It requires to be soon eaten, 
for in a few hours the compactness of its flesh 
is gone. It may be cut in slices and fried in 
eggs and bread-crumbs. 

Morchella. — Pileus lacunose (pitted), 
confluent with the stipes, either at the margin 
or a little above it : hymenium occupying the 
whole outer surface. 

39. M. esculenta. — Stipes hollow, white, 
dilated towards the base : pileus roundish or 
oval, cellular, like a honeycomb, closely con- 
tracted round the stipes : plant one to four 
inches high. — This is the well known Morel : 
it occurs in woods and fields, late in the 
spring, preferring a calcareous or argillaceous 
soil. An allied kind, much less common, is 



called 31. semilibera, and has the pileus de- 
tached from the stipes for half its length. 
Neither should be gathered after rain, as they 
are then insipid, and soon spoil. The follow- 
ing is a good mode of cooking morels : — 
Wash and cleanse them from the earth which 
collects between the plaits, and dry them tho- 
roughly in a napkin ; put them in a saucepan 
with pepper, salt, and parsley, adding, or not, 
a piece of ham ; stew for an hour, pouring in 
occasionally a little broth, to prevent burning; 
when done, bind with the yolks of two or three 
eggs, and serve on buttered toast. The Ita- 
lian method is thus : — Wash, dry, and divide 
them across ; put them on the fire, with some 
parsley, scallion, chervil, burnet, tarragon, 
chives, a little salt, and two spoonfuls of fine 
oil ; stew till the juice runs out ; then thicken 
with a little flour, and serve with bread- 
crumbs and a squeeze of lemon. 

Tuber. — Plant stemless ; fleshy, solid, 
not becoming powdery, nor opening at the 
top. 

40. T. cibarium. — Plant nearly globular, 
of the size of a large plum, rarely as large as 
a hen's egg ; rootless ; rough and warty ex- 
ternally, and of a dark colour, internally firm, 
white while young, but when old becoming 
dark coloured with whitish veins. — This is 
the famed Truffle ; it is a subterranean fun- 
gus, growing naturally some inches below 
the surface, and found in various parts of 
England in high woods and pastures. It is 
one of the best and dantiest of the esculent 
fungi. Dogs are taught to hunt for it, and 
they point it out by barking and scratching. 
Various attempts have been made to cultivate 
the truffle artificially, but hitherto with very 
limited success. Mr. Tillery, gardener to the 
Duke of Portland at Welbeck, has, however, 
been to some extent successful. Another 
nearly related species ( T. albideum) is also 
employed. The truffle is prepared and used 
in a manner similar to the morel. 

In his Treatise on Esculent Funguses, Dr. 
Badhani includes some species of Polyporus, 
Peziza acetabulum, and Verpa digitaliformis, 
neither of which are of much value in an escu- 
lent point of view. 

EVERGREEN STANDARD TREES, AND 
ITALIAN GARDENS. 

Wherever the Italian style of gardening 
is introduced, with its terraces, straight walks, 
mock avenues, and other formal arrangements, 
standard evei"green trees are desirable accom- 
paniments. The orange tree is one of the 
most favourite trees for the purpose ; and in 
Italy, of course, it may be thus employed 
with little trouble or inconvenience, on ac- 
count of the Italian climate. In some of the 



EVERGREEN STANDARD TREES. 



first-rate garden establishments in this coun- 
try, where orangeries are maintained, a very 
similar course is followed, — the orange trees 
being set out in the situations alluded to, dur- 
ing the summer season. It is not, however, 
generally known, that the common hardy 
Laurel, and the Portugal Laurel, may be 
used as substitutes for the orange, to produce 
the effect for which they are introduced to 
Italian gardens. Such, however, is the case, 
and the difficulty of preserving orange trees, 
therefore, need be no bar to the construction 
of Italian gardens by persons of limited con- 
veniences. 

YTe are not about to compare the formal 
aspect of an Italian garden with the natural- 
ness which is characteristic of the prevailing 
English style of gardening, nor to recommend 
one at the expense of the other. Italian 
gardens are quite in character in certain 
situations, such as in the vicinity of buildings 
of the Italian style ; but whether of greater 
or less extent, they should form detached 
scenes. Into the composition of such gar- 
dens, formal, mostly round-headed evergreen 
trees, almost necessarily enter ; such trees are 
set at equal distances by the sides of walks, 
forming avenues in miniature ; or they are 
set with equal formality, though less con- 
tinuity, at the angles and conspicuous points, 
which they serve to mark. For this purpose, 
the laurels are almost equal to the orange 
tree itself ; and as must be obvious to the 
merest casual observer, they may be employed 
in nine cases out of ten, when the latter 
would be altogether out of the question. The 
gratification afforded by an Italian garden, 
or at least by the appropriate introduction of 
Italian scenery, may, therefore, by their 
agency be extended to a greater number than 
could otherwise hope to enjoy it. The Por- 
tugal Laurel is perhaps to be preferred for 
the purpose to the common kind, being more 
tree-like in its habit. 

The formation of the plants is nothing more 
than a work of time. In the first place, young, 
healthy plants are chosen, and those must be 
selected which have a leading shoot ; this 
must be encouraged ; the lower branches gra- 
dually reduced, and the leader as sedulously 
maintained, until a clear straight stem, free 
from branches, and of the requisite height — 
five or six feet — is obtained ; the head is, of 
course, then formed by continued and close 
pruning, or stopping back. The plants are 
stationed in this way : — large tubs " without 
bottoms" are placed permanently in the situa- 
tions the plants are to occupy ; they are 
then filled with good soil, and the young 
standard trees planted in them, the roots 
being confined within the limits of the tub, 
till they descend to the surface of the ordinary 



soil, where, having room to spread with free- 
dom, they luxuriate, the trees become vigorous, 
and being frequently, almost continually, kept 
pruned or pinched back, they form compact 
round heads, which in appearance, at a little 
distance, very much resemble an orange tree, 
aud serve equally well as to the effect pro- 
duced. 

The Portugal Laurel (Cerasus lusitanica) 
is perhaps the most elegant of the two kinds 
of laurel for this object, and also the most 
suitable ; but even the common laurel (Ce- 
rasus Lauro-cerasus) may be employed with 
very good effect, notwithstanding its more 
shrubby character. The foliage of either of 
these trees, as is well known, is bold and striking, 
and this is just what is wanted ; for it is the 
form and foliage of the tree, more than any 
gaiety of flowering, which is required to pro- 
duce the effect sought for. 

The Laurustinus {Viburnum Tinus,) might 
be employed to form smaller trees, such as 
are called half-standards, that is, with stems 
about three feet high. A well-furnished plant 
would not only look well as an evergreen dur- 
ing the greater part of the year, but would, 
in addition, look exceedingly handsome, when 
covered with its snowy blossoms in the early 
part of winter. 

The Arbutus {Arbutus Unedo, and others), 
though less free growing than the preceding, 
might without much difficulty be moulded 
into the form required; and, in addition to 
any beauty they may possess as evergreens, 
they would be ornamented during winter with 
a double crop, — a batch of waxy, greenish- 
white flowers, and handsome pendent scarlet 
strawberry-iike fruit. 

Another plant which would form a good 
companion for the Laurustinus, is the Daphne 
hybrida, a species of free growth, with dark- 
green glossy leaves, and almost uninterrup- 
tedly covered with small tufts of purplish 
flowers, which are not indeed remarkably 
showy, but make up for this by their delicious 
sweetness. This plant might be grown to 
form a handsome half-standard. 

Nothing certainly can be handsomer as 
artificial objects than the standard Rhodo- 
dendrons, raised in some of the leading nur- 
series for American plants ; and such plants 
of Rhododendrons might be obtained and in- 
troduced with propriety and good effect in 
the situations we allude to. Of course, they 
would have to be treated with some reference 
to their natural habits and characters. Such 
trees as these are magnificent when in bloom, 
and at other times, being evergreen, would 
serve the same purposes as orange trees, or 
their substitutes, the Portugal laurels. 

One further hint may be worth offering : of 
course, when the roots of free growing plants,

such as those which have been referred to, 
are confined within such narrow limits as in 
this case they would be, there is a possibility, 
that as the plants become old, and the roots 
have taken up most of the nutriment within 
their reach, the leaves would become yellow 
and sickly-looking. Now, this would be 
positively opposed to the object in introducing 
such plants at all ; and it would be better to 
do without them altogether, than to have 
them in a miserable plight. This, therefore, 
must be avoided. There is perhaps no better 
or easier way to do this than to use liquid 
manure during summer (of course, abundant 
supplies of water, also, will be required). 
Guano water, or water in which some of the 
nitrates, as nitrate of soda and potash have 
been dissolved, will serve the purpose. Soot 
water would also be found a good form of 
liquid manure for this purpose. 

NATURE'S HINTS TO FLORISTS. 

How singular but unerring a lesson is 
given us in the constant struggle of nature 
to resume her sway ! When man has been 
permitted to lead her out of her usual course, 
whether it be in the crossing of the races of 
animals, or the hybridizing or high cultivation 
of flowers and plants, the animal and vege- 
table kingdom alike yield to the constant at- 
tention and skill of man, and alike revert to 
their own original character the instant man 
relaxes in his care. Does it not seem a beau- 
tiful object of contemplation that man is 
rewarded for his skill and ingenuity in being 
sanctioned in his endeavours to improve the 
races of animals and vegetables ? Here is a 
fact which speaks volumes. Nature scatters 
her beauties in abundance, but all things have 
individually only a small share ; man is en- 
deavouring to collect the shares of many sub- 
jects into one individual. Agriculturists ob- 
tain by cross-breeding and high feeding the 
good points of several animals in one ; the 
gardener obtains in a single fruit the good 
qualities of several ; the florist rests not until 
he has monopolised in a single flower the good 
qualities that have been divided among many. 
Take any popular subject for an illustration : 
to the Rhododendron family nature has been 
bountiful, but her favours have not been 
lavished on one ; to It. ponticum she has given 
the valuable quality of hardiness, but the 
flower is mean, the foliage poor; to arboreum 
she has given a brilliance of colour not to be 
surpassed. The florist has by means of his 
art and science so cross-bred these two kinds, 
as to have obtained in one individual both the 
hardiness and the brilliant colour ; and having 
attained this object, he is permitted to multi- 
ply the new branch of the family to any 



extent, and the subject is established in per- 
petuity. Plant out one of the individuals where- 
ever it will grow, and it will not degenerate, 
as man calls it ; it will not revert to its former 
ill-shaped, mean looking flower and foliage on 
the one hand, nor will it loose its hardiness 
on the other. But man is permitted to go 
farther than this ; by a different mode of cul- 
ture he is allowed to increase the vigour of a 
plant, and by seeding from it in the state of 
excitement, to produce a disposition to sport ; 
to select from the progeny such as deviate 
from the natural habit, and, according to his 
finite notions, are improved in form, texture, 
or colour, and by bits from the plant itself to 
multiply the same thing to any extent ; but as 
this is no longer concentrating the individual 
beauties which nature had already supplied, 
but creating out of her abundant powers new 
ones contrary to the original properties of the 
plant, the instant man relaxes his watchful- 
ness, and withholds that management which 
has produced the change, he loses the charac- 
ter which he has established. But we have 
yet one feature in this change that rarely 
enters the mind of the thoughtless. The 
change is wrought. The individual variety 
is multiplied, and passes into the hands of the 
idle, as well as the industrious ; the former 
puts his pet plant into the ground and leaves 
it there, uncared for, unattended ; the latter 
continues the care which produced the change. 
The idle one sees nature claiming her wan- 
dering subject, and the flower go back as near 
as may be to the original simple form ; the 
industrious florist preserves his in all its 
beauty and integrity. To bring this home by 
example : the Pansy has been changed from 
its native deformity — if it be not impious 
to call anything in nature deformed — to a bold, 
circular, velvety, rich flower ; continue pro- 
pagating by cuttings and rich feeding, and it 
remains true. Plant it out on poor, natural 
soil, and leave it untouched, and it will go 
back to a form, and diminish to a size, that 
no florist would tolerate in his garden. Pinks, 
carnations, and picotees, are in this parti- 
cular the same ; place them in natural ground, 
and leave them there ; and you will see them 
diminish in size and doubleness, and get worse 
in form, until they become like wild ones, in- 
stead of garden varieties. Again, sow seed 
from any of these highly bred flowers ; nature 
struggles so hard to regain her sway, that 
nine-tenths of the seedlings are more like the 
original flower than like the improved one. 
The vigilance of the florist is obliged to step 
in ; he destroys all that go back a single step, 
and retains only those which maintain their 
improvement. Let him save seed from the 
whole collection, bad and good, and his relax- 
ation this one season is fatal. They will

nearly all be degenerated, as we thoughtlessly 
call it, meaning, however, they will have 
gone back nearly to their original state. It 
would seem as if it were designed for an im- 
portant lesson. Assiduity, skill, and perse- 
verance, are rewarded by the accomplishment 
of great objects. After they have been ac- 
complished for the benefit of all who desire 
to enjoy them, they are preserved to the care- 
ful, and lost to the idle man. Nobody can 
look with indifference on these things ; they 
may he idle, carele-s, vicious, and not look at 
all ; but if they do look, they must see in them 
the language of a monitor. No matter to what 
flower we turn, wherever there has been at- 
tained the greatest alteration from nature, 
there will be found the necessity of exercising 
the greatest vigilance. The finest pansy, 
pink, carnation, picotee, tulip, auricula, ra- 
nunculus, polyanthus, anything greatly im- 
proved by culture, may be placed side by side, 
and left a season or two, and nobody would 
know them again ; and supposing there were 
none but them to show what had been done, it 
would take many years to recover the loss and 
retrograde movement of two neglected seasons.

Proceedings of the Horticultural 
Society of London, with Notes bi a 
Practical Gardener. 

Transplanting- large Forest Trees in 
Parks. — This is a country abounding with 
stone, and as my quarries, out of which I was 
building a new mansion, afforded much refuse 
stone in large lumps, I made a trial by plant- 
ing some trees of about eight feet high, and 
placing at their feet two two-horse cart loads of 
rough lumps of stone, not built up high, but, 
packed close by each other, and set on edge 
so as to make a tabular, but very rugged sur- 
face round the foot of the tree, and extended 
to the distance of four feet. These trees 
succeeded well, and far beyond my ex- 
pectation. On considering the cause of their 
success, it appeared to me that the stones 
served the three purposes of fencing, staking, 
and mulching : the first of which is always 
necessary, to defend them from the assaults 
of cattle : the second is equally so, if the 
plants are tall, to save them from being dis- 
placed by winds after they shall have taken 
fresh root : and the third, also, is necessary 
in case of a dry summer, the first after the 
transplantation of the trees, to protect the 
soil from over drought, whilst they are strik- 
ing fresh root into it. The stones placed as 
I have described are a sufficient fence against 
horned cattle, which, having feet made for 
going upon soft ground, will not mount the 
rugged surface of the stones. Sheep and 
deer will scarcely annoy trees whose bark has 



acquired roughness ; but they may be easily 
repelled by a few thorns bound round the 
lower part of the stems. Nor will common 
horses go upon the stones, or endeavour to 
reach the trees and tear off the bark. But 
against high bred horses, which are disposed 
to attack everything of w r ood, the stones are 
not a sufficient fence, unless they are packed 
with a surface very rugged, and extended six 
feet round the tree. Against displacement 
by winds, the stones are a better security 
than can be provided by any manner of 
staking and binding ; for they are a power 
always in action by their weight, and the 
surface of the soil is shaded by them from 
the too great power of the sun, whilst the 
rains sink through and encourage the roots 
to sprout afresh and extend themselves 
through the soil : thus they serve the purpose 
of mulching. The weight of the stones, as 
a security against displacement by winds, 
excels any staking, because it is constantly in 
action : once sufficient, is always so : but the 
bandage with Avhich the tree is secured by 
staking often decays and becomes loosened, 
and the tree is displaced before the failure of 
the bandage is discovered and repaired. Be- 
sides, I have observed, upon taking up some 
young trees, which upon a former transplanta- 
tion in the nursery had been staked, that 
the part of the stakes sunk in the ground had, 
in their course of decay, produced a mouldi- 
ness in the soil about them, and the trees had 
refused to strike fresh roots in that direction ; 
or, if they had struck any, the mouldiness in 
the soil had caused them to decay. The best 
trees to plant out are certainly those whose 
roots and heads have been properly trained 
by pruning and cultivation, in a nursery : 
such may be planted out at greater ages and 
sizes than trees taken from plantations of a 
few years growth, and will both strike fresh 
root more certainly, and grow faster. Au- 
tumn, immediately that the leaf is fallen, is 
the best season for the work ; and, by careful 
practice, according to the method above de- 
scribed, I have had perfect success in trans- 
planting trees of from eight to twenty feet high. 
— Letter by Sir C. 31. L. Monch, Bart. 

[There can be no doubt that the pressure 
of the even weight of mould and stone all 
over the roots is better than stakes would be ; 
but unless stones be handy to the premises it 
would be expensive, and the stakes must be 
resorted to.] 

Horticultural hint. — Experiments have 
been made, which proved that both walnut 
and mulberry trees may be readily made to 
produce fruit at three years old from cuttings; 
and there appears every reason to believe 
that the same mode of culture would be equally 
successful in similar cases.

Wall trees. — In training wall trees there 
is much in the modern practice which ^appears 
defective and irrational : sufficient attention 
has never been paid to the form which the 
species or variety naturally assumes ; and be 
its growth upright or pendent, it is con- 
strained to take precisely the same form on 
the Avail. — Knight. 

Glass-houses. — The construction of forcing 
houses appears to be generally very defective, 
and two are rarely constructed alike, though 
intended for the same purposes ; probably not 
a single building of this kind has yet been 
erected, in which the greatest possible quan- 
tity of space has been obtained, and of light 
and heat admitted, proportionate to the capital 
expended. It may even be questioned, whe- 
ther a single hot-bed has ever been made in 
the most advantageous form ; and the proper 
application of glass, where artificial heat is 
not employed, is certainly very ill understood. 
« — - Knight. 

Manuring. — Every gardener is well ac- 
quainted with methods of applying manure 
with success to annual plants ; for these, as 
Evelyn has just observed, "having but little 
time to fulfil the intentions of nature," readily 
accept nutriment in almost any form in which 
it can be offered them ; but trees being formed 
for periods of longer duration, are frequently 
much injured by the injudicious and excessive 
use of manure. The gardener is often igno- 
rant of this circumstance ; and not unfre- 
quently forms a compost for his wall trees, 
which, for a few years stimulating them to 
preternatural exertion, becomes the source of 
disease and early decay. It is also generally 
supposed that the same ingredients, and in 
the same proportion to each other, which are 
best calculated to bring one variety of any 
species of fruit to perfection, are equally well 
adapted to every other variety of that species: 
but experience does not justify this conclu- 
sion; and the peach in many soils acquires a 
high degree of perfection where its variety, 
the nectarine, is comparatively of little value ; 
and the nectarine frequently possesses its full 
flavour in a soil which does not well suit the 
peach. The same remark is also applicable 
to the pear and apple ; and as defects of op- 
posite kinds occur in the varieties of species of 
fruit, those qualities in the soil which are 
beneficial in some cases will be found injuri- 
ous in others. In those districts where the 
apple and pear are cultivated for cyder and 
perry, much of the success of the planter is 
found to depend on his skill, or good fortune, 
in adapting his fruits to the soil. — Knight. 

Onions. — The seed is sown on a slight hot- 
bed in the second week in March ; the plants, 
when up, are exposed to the air whenever 
the weather permits, and in the last week in 



April they are planted out in the following 
manner : — Deep drills are made on a piece of 
well-dug ground, fifteen inches asunder, and 
the drills are filled with good compost of equal 
parts of sandy loam and rotten dung ; the 
plants, being drawn carefully from the bed, 
are placed in these drills, at twelve inches 
distance from each other, their fibres only 
being covered with the mould, and the entire 
bulb kept above ground. When planted they 
receive a gentle watering, which is continued 
daily, unless rain falls, till the roots have 
got hold of the compost ; they are after- 
wards hoed, when necessary, and occasionally 
watered till they are fit to take up. — Mr. 
Thomas James. 

Preserving Grapes till very late in 
the season. — The grapes are ripened in the 
vineries under the glass, but without any arti- 
ficial heat. In the autumn, as soon as the 
weather becomes damp, light fires in the flues 
about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, 
giving plenty of air at the same time. The 
fires are put out in the afternoon, and the 
houses are closely shut up at night. This is 
continued daily, as long as the crops of grapes 
remain in use. The fire in the day, aided by 
the circulation of the air, renders the whole 
interior of the houses perfectly dry, so that no 
damp exists in them when shut up; a night fire, 
on the contrary, with the houses closed, creates 
a vapour, which causes the fruit to become 
mouldy, and to decay. — Mr. J. Thompson. 

Grafting Pears upon Quince stocks. 
— One great improvement in the cultivation 
of the pear, is a method practised many years 
ago, but not generally enough adopted; that of 
the choice sorts being grafted upon the quince, 
by which they come several years sooner into 
bearing, and produce much better crops than 
those upon the common or free stock. I have 
had opportunities of seeing the superiority of 
the quince stock in three different counties, 
and with as many different sorts of soil, and 
have not found any disadvantage whatever in 
it, although some disapprove the use of it. I 
think the objections are made only by those 
who have not given the two sorts of stocks a 
fair trial. Pears on the quince require less 
wall room at planting ; but an equal space of 
wall, occupied by trees on quinces, will pro- 
duce from three to five times the quantity of 
fruit which could have been obtained from 
trees on free stocks, and in some cases still 
more, and the fruit will be in no respect infe- 
rior. — Mr. T. Tororon. 

Late Celery. — John Wedgewood, Esq. 
has stated that he made a plantation of celery, 
late in the year, from the seedling plants which 
had remained in the seed-bed till they had 
gi'own to considerable size. The plants thus 
removed not only took well, but had the ad-

Staxdard clembixg roses. — One of the 
prettiest forms in which many of the climb- 
ing roses may be introduced to the garden, is 
that of a standard. Those varieties which 
make shoots of moderate length, produce, when 
worked on a straight stem of five or six feet 
high, and allowed first of all to form a broad 
expansive head, and then to assume a natu- 
rally drooping habit, a surpassingly beautiful 
effect, the long carelessly pendent branches 
forming so many festoons of roses. On lawns 
the effect of tree-roses thus flounced and 
wreathed, is excellent. Such plants must 
have but little pruning ; and that little con- 
fined to the shortening of any casual over- 
luxuriant shoots, and the cutting clean away 
any such as become old and worn out. In other 
respects, the plants must be left to nature. 
Many of the varieties of Boursault roses are 
well suited for this purpose ; as also are some 
of the Sempervirens, or evergreen group. 

Preserving gaedex seeds. — This is a 
question upon which gardeners and their 
employers often differ in opinion, the latter 
often thinking that, in an economical point 
of view, the matter is one of importance. 
With respect to ordinary garden seeds, 
that is to say, the bulk of the seeds re- 
quired in a garden to produce the necessary 
crops, whether culinary or floral, there cannot 
be a greater mistake than to suppose that any 
advantage can be derived from the practice of 
saving them in private gardens. Seed-grow- 
ing is a distinct branch of trade ; and owing 
to competition, seeds are brought to market 
at the lowest remunerative prices. Those who 
grow seeds to supply the market, moreover, 
are enabled to bestow that attention which is 
necessary to secure a genuine article. All 
our kitchen garden crops, and the more popu- 
lar flowers, are in a highly artificial state, 
induced by high culture. Speaking in a 
general sense, it would be next to impossible 
to grow these crops over and over again from 
the same stock, and on the same soil, without 
deterioration ; they would, in fact, return 
gradually, and more or less rapidly, to their 
original wild condition — unless, that is, ex- 
traordinary means were adopted to prevent 
this, and this would far out-balance the eco- 
nomy. But leaving this out of the question, 
there is no economy in saving ordinary gar- 
den seeds as they would be produced in ordi- 
nary course : seeds must be watched, and 
gathered, and dried, and cleaned, and stored 



. by. All this takes time ; and the time thus 
occupied is, in almost every case, more valua- 
ble than the seed which is obtained, even 
supposing it to be genuine, which, in nine 
cases out of ten, it would not be : so that, in 
fact, a high price would be paid for a very 
inferior article. Now, seed of an inferior 
quality and character could not produce good 
j crops, and thus the loss would not rest with 
the seed itself, but would be prospective, 
affecting the value of the future crops raised 
from it. This is on the presumption that 
there is no spare time in which the seeds 
j might be attended to ; and in ninety-nine of 
every hundred gardens there is no such spare 
j time. The labour allowed is generally under 
rather than over the necessary amount; and if 
any part of this is thus occupied, it is evident 
that something must be neglected. "Within 
the limits of a single garden, too, many kinds 
would become intermixed or hybridised, and 
rendered altogether spurious. As a general 
rule, therefore, it is not an economical plan 
for a gardener to save for himself the seeds 
he requires. There are, however, two or 
three exceptions. Sometimes gardeners suc- 
ceed in obtaining a " good strain," as florists 
would say, of some precarious kind of crop — 
brocoli, for example : in such a case, it is 
commendable to endeavour to perpetuate it if 
possible. Sometimes, either designedly or 
accidentally, they may produce an altogether 
new kind ; and in this case, too, it is, un- 
doubtedly, proper to secure seeds for its perpe- 
tuation and distribution. Some flower seeds, 
too, might be saved in most gardens, confining 
the selection to such as are rare, and are in 
their wild unchanged form. Such plants as 
stocks, for example, which are in a highly 
artificial state, could not, generally, be saved 
with advantage. In fact, these flowers, the 
best of which are imported from Germany, 
are there grown in pots, and seeded with 
great care , and outdoor seeds, even in that 
climate, are not at all prized. The principal 
general objection, therefore, to the growing 
and saving of garden seeds in private gardens 
is, that the article thus obtained is of very 
inferior quality. Again, it should never be 
attempted to save any two nearly allied crops 
at the same time, and this is especially the 
case with the whole cabbage tribe : not only 
should not two varieties of cabbage be pre- 
served at the same time for seed-bearing, in 
the same garden, or even in neighbouring gar- 
dens, but only one of the whole family, includ- 
ing cabbages, brocoli, cauliflower, turnips, &c. 
Thesamemaybe said of varieties of lettuce, and 
other similar crops, of which there are nume- 
rous varieties. Something may be done to 
prevent their mixing, by having them so as 
to come into flower at different periods.

THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 

Sore peas and beans in sheltered, dry, and 
warm situations. 

Plant and transplant cabbages, cauli- 
flowers, lettuces, potatoes, and shallots. 

General Directions. — Drain, dig, dung, 
trench, and ridge the ground as required. 
Such crops as brocoli, and anything likely to 
surfer from the severity of the weather, must 
be sheltered. Finish taking up the various 
roots, and have them properly stored. 

Artichokes (Globe). — Mulch close about 
them with long litter from the stable, and 
dig in a good portion of decomposed manure. 

Artichokes (Jerusalem) should be care- 
fully taken up, and laid on a cool floor, as 
potatoes ; they must be clean gathered up, 
else they become troublesome as weeds. 

Asparagus. — Top dress the beds with rich 
manure, of which good hotbed dung is per- 
haps the best form. 

Beans. — Plant a crop of the Mazagan 
during the second week ; draw the drills 
shallow, and leave the soil after covering 
them in a ridge form. 

Beet. — Dig up carefully, that is, do not 
bruise the roots at any part so as to occasion 
bleeding ; shake the soil off the roots, but 
do not use the knife much ; it is better to 
wrench off the tops. 

Brocoli. — Secure the early sorts from frost : 
48. 



the heads keep well when cut low and placed 
in a cellar or cool close shed. 

Cabbage. — A few of the best plants may 
be planted out in a good situation, not other- 
wise ; they are sometimes much hurt by 
frost. 

Carrots. — If the weather is mild, thin out, 
and hoe the autumn sowing. See to the 
storing away of those dug up. Have the 
ground for the spring sowing well manured 
and trenched ; the dung must be decomposed, 
and the soil deep and fine. 

Endive. — It is well to lift all the roots that 
are likely to be of use soon, and put them in 
frames, or cover them with dry soil in a shed 
or cellar ; but it must be done when they are 
free from wet. 

Caulijioivers.— In mild seasons, the late 
plantings will still be in use ; cut all that 
are nearly ready, and bring them in under 
glass ; those ready for use may be kept for 
any moderate length of time, if cut very 
low, and packed either amongst charcoal, or, 
if in a dark place, without it. 

Parsnips. — Lose no time in taking up the 
roots, as they are apt to be injured by re- 
maining in the soil ; the autumn sowing 
should °be partially thinned, and well hoed 
when dry. 

Parsley has proved serviceable in severe 
weather when kept in frames ; and provision 
should be made for that purpose if required. 

Peas. — Sow such as the Racehorse or 
Early frame in a warm border, or by the side 
of the south wall. 

Potatoes.— Plant as early as possible, and 

i i

of the earliest sorts ; do not add dung about 
the sets ; plant six inches deep. 

Salsify and Scorzoriera. — Get up the roots, 
and have them cleaned and stored in dry 
sand immediately, if not already done. 

SeahaJe. — Give a thorough cleaning, and 
have it all slightly covered with leaves or 
strawy litter. 

Shallots. — Plant on the first dry day ; but 
if the soil is wet defer it until spring. 

Spinach must be carefully gathered, that 
is, pick the under full-grown leaves, and not 
the upper ones, from the plants. A slight 
hoeing when dry operates beneficially ; and 
when wanted regularly for use, it is often 
advantageous to have foresight enough to 
pick it the night before severe frosts. 

Turnips should all be secured from the wet : 
they keep well out of doors, covered with 
straw ; but it is preferable to have them in 
a corner of the potato-house, where a little 
litter may be cast over them. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Proceed in earnest 
with the pruning and nailing of wall trees, 
leaving nothing until spring that can be done 
now ; defer only the apricots, peaches, nec- 
tarines, and figs. When the trees are very 
luxuriant, root pruning may be resorted to. 
This operation consists in opening a trench 
two feet from the stem, and cutting all the 
strong and tap roots ; to do this well, get first 
an idea of the nature and extent of the roots, 
so as to form, when pruning, an equilibrium 
between the latter and the branches. New 
plantations of all sorts of trees may be pro- 
ceeded with : drain well at bottom, and plant 
shallow. The fruit is, ere this, expected to 
be all secured. 

Fruit Room. — Give air daily to this struc- 
ture, and pick out all fruit which show decay, 
on its first appearance. It will be necessary 
to keep turning them where they are thick. 
Put the good-keeping sorts on the upper 
shelves, and have all distinctly named. 

Apricots may be planted in a soil of good 
turfy loam, eighteen inches deep ; defer 
pruning both old and young trees until spring, 
but the luxuriant green shoots may be taken 
away at once. 

Apples. — Young and old trees in every 
style of training may now be pruned and tied 
or nailed : cut the wood shoots close in, and 
thin out the fruit spurs. Keep standards 
open in the heart, and dwarf. Plant young 
trees in a loamy soil. 

Cherries. — Finish the pruning and nailing 
of the early sorts ; such as the Morello may 
be deferred. See that in nailing none of the 
shoots are allowed to press against the nail, 



but rather make them rest in the shred, other- 
wise they are liable to canker. 

Currants of all sorts may be pruned and 
dressed ; new plantations may be made, and 
stores of cuttings put in. Do not shorten the 
black currant shoots, merely thin them ; in 
all cases give the bushes a symmetrical form 
and young appearance. 

Figs must be protected in exposed situa- 
tions, with such materials as fern or spruce 
boughs ; remove all the green fruit that are 
larger than marbles, as they are sure to fall 
off in spring. 

Filberts. — Prune similarly to currant bushes: 
remove all the suckers that spring from the 
root ; shorten the spurs when they exceed 
six inches in length ; allow a strong shoot to 
remain to fill up where there is a vacancy. 
Make new plantations, and plant at eight or 
ten feet apart. 

Gooseberries. — In pruning the old bushes, 
do not shorten the leaders ; but this is im- 
portant in young plants to induce them to 
make wood : slip off (not cut) those intended 
for cuttings, and take out all the eyes or buds, 
except three at the top. 

Nectarines and Peaches. — Divest these 
early of all green leaves and unripened shoots, 
but defer pruning until spring. Plant and 
mulch young trees, but the cutting of these 
also must be deferred. 

Pears. — Prune, nail, and plant. Strict 
attention must be paid to the sorts in pruning, 
as some bear best on the young wood ; keep 
the spurs short and thin ; do not stop the 
leading shoots on the wall, except in the case 
of young trees : most of the pears like hox-i- 
zontal training. In planting trees, select or 
make the soil into a loam of medium texture, 
eighteen inches deep, and well drained. 
Newly planted standards it will be necessary 
to stake. 

Plums. — Nail or tie in a good deal of the 
young wood, and shorten the spurs ; tar twine 
is better than anything for tying in the old 
branches. 

Raspberries. — Thin the canes to four or 
five, and cut the others close to the ground : 
tie them up to strong stakes, from four to 
five feet long, and manure and dig between the 
rows. Make new plantations, keeping them 
four feet apart in the row, and from six to 
eight between ; choose a shady place, and a 
deep rich soil. 

Vines. — Prune and nail in early : cut out 
all the weak and unripened rods, and shorten 
most of those left to three or four eyes ; this 
is better than spurring for walls. 

THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Continue to clean out 
the houses, and prepare for early forcing : lay 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR NOVEMBER. 



483 



up stores of leaves and strawy litter for fer- 
menting material. Begin to force plants always 
with a low temperature, and gradually raise 
it, thus folloAving nature, who is steady in her 
course. Decrease the heat in pineries and 
stoves where cucumbers or such things are 
grown ; also use less water. Protect and 
keep dry the various plants intended to be 
made available for forcing. 

Asparagus. — Prepare a hot-bed, or take in 
some to the mushroom house, or any place 
where there is a heat of from 50 to 60 degrees. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature 70 to 75 de- 
grees by day, and from 60 to 65 degrees at 
night. Cut in those plants which may appear 
exhausted, which will again revive them. 
Fumigate often, and admit air every day ; 
retain only a few fruit on the plants at one 
time. 

Figs. — Temperature from 50 to 65 de- 
grees. It is well to allow them a little rest ; 
but those in pots may be kept or put to work 
in succession. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature from 50 to 
65 degrees. If in the pine stove, syringe 
night and morning ; give a little air daily, and 
all the light possible : sow for succession. 

Melons. — "Where there is a convenience for 
growing them in pots, make preparation by 
sowing at the end of the month ; otherwise it 
is far better to defer it until January. 

JHushrooms. — Temperature 55 degrees. 
Raise part of the heat by sweating and pre- 
paring in the house the dung for the suc- 
cessional beds ; when fire heat is used, water 
the pipes or flues often. The heat in spent 
beds may be assisted by lying a little litter 
over the surface ; when the beds require 
water, use it in a tepid state. 

Musas. — Temperature from 60 to 70 de- 
grees. Decrease the moisture, and make it 
winter with them. 

Mustard and Cress will do anywhere in 
boxes, thinly covered, with a heat of 60 de- 
grees ; keep them near the glass. 

Oranges. — Temperature from 40 to 55 
degrees. Sponge over the dusty foliage ; 
avoid syringing, unless very slightly, and 
when the sun shines. 

Peaches. — Those in pots may be started by 
being placed in a heat of 45 degrees for two 
weeks : give the early houses plenty of air, 
and have them in perfect order, that is, the 
trees pruned and tied, and the border forked, 
cleaned, and watered, by the end of the 
month. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature from 60 to 
70 degrees ; the succession plants 5 degrees 
less. Have the linings to the frames and pits 
renewed with fresh leaves and litter, or tan ; 
give air daily, and meet the defect of heat by 
adding a little fire ; water very sparingly. 



Rhubarb. — Temperature from 50 to 60 
degrees. The mushroom-house is an excel- 
lent place for bringing on rhubarb ; lift and 
plant a few of the best roots, and water them 
with tepid water. The same with sea-kale : 
but both may be forced in the ground by 
putting over the crowns, boxes or pots, and 
covering the whole with litter and leaves ; a 
strong heat at first must be avoided, and test- 
stakes must be used in the dung, so as to 
guard against its becoming more than milk- 
warm ; this is known by pulling out the 
stakes and feeling them. To be ready at 
Christmas, begin early this month. 

Strawberries. — A few of the best ripened 
plants may now be put in a heat ranging 
from 45 to 50 degrees, and kept neai this for 
two weeks, then slightly increased : the front 
of the pine-stove will ultimately suit them. 
Those advancing should be syringed twice a- 
day, and aired daily, and have all the light 
possible. 

Vineries. — Do not start any of the houses 
until the end of the month at the soonest, 
and then slowly. Those in pots may be 
started now in dung heat, say at 50 degrees, 
for a fortnight ; syringe freely : have arrange- 
ments perfect, however, for increasing the 
heat either where they are, or elsewhere. 

FLOWER GARDEN AND SHRUBBERY. 

Plant and Transplant shrubs, bulbous 
roots, and various hardy biennials and per- 
ennials, if the weather is dry and open. 

General Directions. — Persevere with trans- 
planting, pruning, and protecting ; also the 
making of alterations. Drain and trench where 
possible, if the ground is to be planted upon 
in spring. The laying of turf, box, and other 
edgings, manuring, sweeping, rolling, and 
gravelling, will also be among the principal 
operations. 

Alpines and Auriculas. — Give plenty of 
air, and little water ; stir the surface of the 
soil, and remove all dead leaves. 

Antirrhinums, Aquilegias, and Anemones, 
should be planted without delay. 

Calceolarias and Campanulas should have 
plenty of air, and be well protected, particu- 
larly the calceolarias ; remove all appearances 
of damp, and water sparingly. 

Chrysanthemums. — Cut over when past 
bloom : take up portions of the choice varieties 
to increase them, and to secure them from 
frost. In ordinary weather, those planted out, 
will stand without protection : keep all those 
in pots cool. 

Clematis and other deciduous climbers 
may be pruned and nailed, or tied in, taking 
the hardiest first, and deferring the more 
tender sorts until spring ; meanwhile give 

u2 



484 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR NOVEMBER. 



them a slight protection with spruce boughs 
or the dried fronds of fern. 

Dahlias must be kept secure from frost and 
damp ; they should be taken up on a dry day, 
and well dried in the shade ; the roots keep 
best when buried upside down in sand ; allow 
those in cutting pots to remain in the soil, and 
keep them perfectly dry. 

Fuchsias. — Those kept dwarf may be cut 
down, and litter put around them ; but the 
standards — by far the most valuable — should 
be cut close in to one stem, and this closely 
wrapt round with hay-bands : the root also 
must be well covered ; mats or fern fronds 
are available for those on walls. 

Jasmines and Honeysuckles. — The common 
sorts are hardy, and may be well thinned and 
tied in ; but the tender sorts must be slightly 
protected. 

Laurustinus, Arbutus, Sweet Bay, and other 
evergreens, are benefited much by slight pro- 
tection in exposed situations ; and especially 
if covered around the stem at the roots, with 
hay or strawy litter. 

Liliums are amongst the grandest of our 
flowering bulbs, and are mostly hardy ; they 
should be planted largely, and are admi- 
rably adapted, either for skirting the edges 
cf lawn clumps and the shrubbery, for 
planting singly in the promiscuous borders, 
or in masses in the flower garden : they 
luxuriate in a soil of turfy peat and loam with 
a good portion of sand ; plant five or six 
inches deep. 

Lobelias, if not taken up, should be seen 
to at once ; they will keep in boxes or pots in 
any out-of-the-way place in the greenhouse 
where they will be much exposed to damp. 

Pansies. — Strew dry litter over the beds 
in severe weather : give those in frames all 
the air and light possible ; stir the soil and 
give little water. 

Pinks, Carnations, and Picotees, may still 
be planted out if the weather is open and 
mild ; but in ordinary cases, to keep them 
under glass and free of damp by airing plen- 
tifully and watering sparingly, is most com- 
mendable. 

Roses. — Make arrangements for adding to 
the collection. Prepare a soil of good loam, 
rather heavy, and well manured, and drained ; 
but defer planting much until spring, if not 
done immediately. In purchasing plants, 
select those which have been budded on clean 
and strong stems, and have fast hold of them ; 
get a number of dwarfs and train them in a 
pyramidal form, which is at once natural and 
beautiful. Attend to the protecting of the 
tender varieties ; and mulch the newly planted 
as well as the others with strawy cow-dung. 
Procure stocks of briars for budding on, and 
plant them in nursery rows four feet apart, 



and eighteen inches between. The Hybrid 
Perpetuals are generally the most valuable 
sorts. 

Ranunculuses, Tulips, Fritillarias, &c. 
should all be planted as early as possible, 
except when successional bloom is wanted. 

Salvias. — The half hardy sorts should be 
taken up and preserved in boxes below the 
greenhouse stage through the winter. 

Verbenas, though they endure the winter 
in some places, scarcely repay the trouble, 
unless in dry and warm situations : it is pre- 
sumed that a full stock is long since secured 
in frames, and have air and water adminis- 
tered according to their wants. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

Guard carefully against cold frosty winds ; 
never allow them to blow upon any of the 
plants which are kept within doors, but still 
give air at every favourable opportunity, as 
the prevention of damp and mouldiness de- 
pends mainly on this. Do not keep any but 
forced flowers in rooms where a fire is con- 
stantly maintained ; and even those should be 
kept in the coolest part. Apply water with 
great caution, using no more than sufficient 
to keep the various plants in an equal and 
regular state of moisture. As a matter of 
neatness and cleanliness, pots are generally 
placed in pans or feeders, but water should 
never be allowed to remain in them, or the 
roots will inevitably become damaged. 

Bulbs, such as hyacinths, crocus, &c. 
should be steadily encouraged ; a few of the 
best rooted, whether in glasses or pots, being 
placed in a warmer situation as soon as they 
have made a tolerable quantity of roots. The 
others should be allowed to advance at their 
leisure ; they will succeed one another in due 
time, and thus keep up a succession. 

Begonias. — Give no water, but keep them 
cool to prevent their shrivelling, and also to 
keep them from shooting too soon. 

Camellias. — Place some of the most for- 
ward in a warmer situation, and water rather 
more freely ; keep the leaves clean by spong- 
ing them occasionally. 

Cinerarias. — Reduce the water as the 
weather becomes cold and wet, to prevent 
them from damping ; keep them near the 
light, and give all the air possible, to prevent 
their drawing. 

Fuchsias. — Keep them cool, and apply no 
water unless the balls of earth become too 
dry, and then be careful that any surplus 
drains clearly away. 

Geraniums.' — Apply little or no water even 
to those in a growing condition, and none at 
all to those put by to rest, unless they are 
absolutely shrivelling. Give air freely when- 
ever practicable, and remove all decaying 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR NOVEMBER. 



485 



leaves or shoots as soon as they become un- 
sightly. 

Myrtles and similar evergreens should be 
carefully watered, and should also have the 
leaves occasionally sponged, or the pot should 
be laid down on the side and the plant well 
syringed to make it free from dust ; give air 
freely on all favourable occasions. 

Roses. — The soft wooded or Chinese sorts 
should be sparingly watered in gloomy 
weather, as they are very liable to damp ; 
keep them in a warm airy place. 

Primulas. — Apply water with great cau- 
tion, but do not keep the plants in too arid a 
situation : shift any intended for late flower- 
ing, if the plants require it. 

Violets. — Keep the plants free from damp 
and decaying leaves, and use little or no water 
in dull weather. A few may be placed in 
a warm airy situation to try for a few early 
blooms ; the tree variety is the best for this 
purpose. 

Wardian Cases. — Where any of the succu- 
lent species of plants are placed in these struc- 
tures, great care should be taken to guard 
against damp, by giving air occasionally, and 
by wiping the inside of the glass. No ad- 
ditional moisture should be applied unless in 
extreme cases, and the plants should be kept 
as near the light as possible. Ferns and simi- 
lar plants require a much damper atmosphere, 
but even in their case water should be spar- 
ingly used during the winter. Remove all 
decaying leaves, and give air at intervals if 
they appear to damp too fast. Except those 
filled with hardy ferns and mosses, the cases 
should be kept in the warmest rooms. \ 

PITS AND FRAMES.' 

The principal operations will consist in 
covering up and uncovering ; increasing the 
quantity of protecting material employed, ac- 
cording to the weather ; in airing when prac- 
ticable ; and in guarding against damp. 

Annuals. — Water very sparingly, but give 
all the ventilation that the weather will per- 
mit. Remove dead or decaying leaves or 
plants, and guard against any stagnation of 
water or soddened earth remaining in the 
pits or frames. 

Half-hardy Plants, as calceolarias, petu- 
nias, verbenas, &c. require water only Avhen 
the plants are thoroughly dry, and not in 
such quantity then as to flood the floor. Give 
all the air possible, but close the sashes early 
in the afternoon, and cover up soon when the 
nights are likely to be frosty. 

Forcing Pit. — Maintain a temperature 
fluctuating a little above or below 55 degrees, 
as the weather permits. Give air when prac- 
ticable, in conjunction with the above condi- 
tions, and regulate the supply of moisture 



accordingly, using little in dull weather. In- 
troduce a fresh supply of roses, lilacs, and 
other shrubs, and especially of Dutch bulbs of 
all sorts, more particularly hyacinths and nar- 
cissus. Look carefully after insects, and 
fumigate immediately the green fly appears. 
Watch the expanding buds of the roses also, 
and pick out the destructive grub which feeds 
on the young leaves and flower buds. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temper attire. — From 45 to 55 degrees by 
day ; and about 40 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Give air on all favourable 
opportunities, observing to close early in the 
afternoon, and to admit little or none on the 
windward side of the house in rough although 
fine weather. Apply no fire heat except 
when compelled by frost. 

Watering. — Apply as little as possible, and 
that only in the morning when the house is 
warm, using the water of the same tempera- 
ture or a few degrees above that of the house. 
The syringe should be laid aside, and all 
slopping avoided as much as possible. 

Potting. — Very little is requisite in this 
way now, except to keep the surface of the 
mould in the pots from becoming soddened or 
covered with moss. Where this is the case, 
the drainage should be examined, and the 
surface stirred and partially renewed ; but be 
careful that the new coating does not lead to 
errors in watering, from the top appearing 
moist, and the old soil remaining dry under- 
neath. 

Soils, — Always maintain a thorough sup- 
ply of composts, and at this season have 
enough under cover to meet the demand ne- 
cessary ; but do not allow any soils so placed 
under cover to become too dry. 

Dressing. — The necessity for uniform neat- 
ness has been so often insisted upon, and is 
so indispensable, that it hardly allows of repe- 
tition ; but the removal of all shabby or de- 
caying leaves, or badly ripened shoots, now 
requires particular attention. 

Insects.- — The majority of insects are now 
in a comparative state of torpidity, but slugs 
and snails should be carefully watched, as the 
warmth of the house keeps them in activity 
nearly all the winter. 

Aloes, and succulents generally, must still 
be maintained in a state of rest, by giving 
little or no water, and keeping them in the 
lightest and airiest part of the house. 

Agaves and larger succulents may now be 
left without water, but should receive all the 
air possible. 

Alstromerias. — Keep these still in a state 
of rest by maintaining a condition as regards 
moisture in which the tubers will neither 
suffer by damping nor shrivelling. 



486 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR NOVEMBER. 



Annuals. — 'Such as are kept in the house 
should be placed near the light, and have all 
the air they can ; and should be very care- 
fully watered, in order to keep them as dwarf 
and stocky as possible. 

Azaleas. — Place such as are advancing, in 
a warmer place, in order to maintain a proper 
succession. Water regularly and thoroughly 
when necessary, in order to keep a fine 
foliage. 

Calceolarias. — Maintain a regularly moist, 
cool, and airy temperature about the plants, 
and pot off or shift such as may require it, 

Camellias. — Keep the plants cool and airy ; 
water regularly, just keeping the roots in a 
moderately moist condition. Move a few of 
the most advanced into the forcing-house, 
but let the increase of heat to the plants be 
very slight and gradual. 

Cape Bulbs, as ixias. gladiolus, &c. should 
be maintained in a state of perfect rest. 
Newly imported bulbs, if arriving at this 
time of the year in good condition, should 
also be kept over till the spring. 

Cephalotus follicularis (New Holland 
pitcher-plant). — Former directions should be 
referred to, and a rather warmer and more 
airy exposure given it to guard against damp. 
Cinerarias. — Such as are very forward 
may be assisted by a little heat ; shift such as 
require it ; water regularly, and rather copi- 
ously. 

Chrysanthemums. — Yfater those in flower 
regularly and freely, according to the state of 
the weather ; remove such as are past flower- 
ing to a frame, or the best shelter available, 
plunging the pots if exposed out of doors. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, as sempervi- 
vum, should be kept warm and dry, and well 
exposed to air and light. 

Cyclamens. — Any that are pushing should 
be steadily encouraged, but not forced too 
fast ; they are better dormant until the turn 
of the season. 

Epacris. — Free ventilation, a regular mois- 
ture at the roots, and a rather low tempera- 
ture, will answer best with these plants at 
present. 

Ericas. — The greatest amount of air possi- 
ble must be given, with a moderate amount of 
moisture at the roots. Great care must also 
be taken against mildew in damp, foggy wea- 
ther ; against this a free and dry atmosphere 
is the best guard. Remove any plants af- 
fected to another house as soon as the attack 
is noticed, and dress them with sulphur. 

Fuchsias. — Still keep these in a state of 
rest ; or any that are in an active state should 
be kept in the coolest and airiest part of the 
house, and get very little water. 

Gompholobiums, and slender creepers, 
should be still kept in a warm but airy place, 



and water supplied with great caution, but 
they must never be allowed to get dry. 

Haworthias, Apicras, &c. — Give water 
only sufficient to prevent them from decreas- 
ing in bulk, and keep them in a warm part of 
the house. 

Helichrysums should be watered sparingly, 
and be kept in a dry and airy part of the 
house. 

Leschenaultias. — Maintain a dry airy 
temperature, and use water with great caution, 
although the roots must never be allowed to 
become dry. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan lily). — Keep 
the roots cool and dry, so as to run no risk of 
starting them into premature growth. 

Mignonette. — The tree-like plants should 
now be in full perfection ; — water regularly, 
but rather sparingly ; and remove the flower- 
spikes before too many of the seed-vessels 
swell so large as to rob the plants of nourish- 
ment, which checks their blooming. 

New Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiasas, &c. require watering regularly, but 
must not receive too much either of moisture 
or heat, so as to encourage a premature growth. 

Orange trees. — Maintain these in a light 
and airy situation if possible, and apply only 
sufficient moisture to keep the roots in a 
healthy condition. 

Oxalis. — Keep all the bulbous species per- 
fectly dry, and apply very little water to the 
succulent stemmed sorts. 

Pelargoniums. — Keep the plants rather 
warm, but still allow a free circulation of air, 
or they will suffer. Stop and tie out the 
branches as they advance. Remove a few of 
the earlier sorts to the coolest part of the 
forcing-house, in order to keep up the succes- 
sion with those similarly treated last month. 
Of course any intended for such use, or to 
come in before the main bloom, should not be 
stopped now. 

Primulas. — Pot off the seedlings, and con- 
tinue to shift the more advanced plants as 
occasion requires. Keep the plants rather 
moist, but also airy, so that no stagnation of 
water may take place near them. Continue to 
pick out the flowers of such as are wanted to 
bloom late in the spring. 

Proteas, Banksias, Dryandras, &c. — 
Adhere to the treatment previously given, 
guarding cautiously against damp. 

Rhododendrons. — Keep them in a cool, 
airy situation, and water regularly but cau- 
tiously, giving no more than sufficient to keep 
the roots in a medium moist state ; a few of 
the commoner sorts may be moved to the cool 
end of the forcing-house, but none of any 
value should be thus treated at this season. 

Roses. — Those turned out against pillars 
or trellises should be kept rather dry, if the

weather prove cold and cloudy. The more 
tender sorts should also be kept rather dry, 
and in a warm but airy place, in order to 
guard against damp. 

Salvias. — Reduce the supply of water to 
the plants as they cease blooming, and gradu- 
ally lessen it until they receive no more than 
will just keep them from withering ; keep the 
tender sorts in a rather warm situation. 

Stapelias. — Continue the previous treat- 
ment, giving no water in dull or damp wea- 
ther, and guarding against any of the pots 
retaining water longer than the others. 

Tropceolwns. — Pot any that may start, but 
keep all others dry for the present. Train 
out regularly those advancing in growth, 
placing the plants in the full-sized pot, and 
fixing them to the trellis on which they are to 
bloom. Water carefully, but never suffer 
those in a growing state to become dry. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature, from 55 to 60 degrees by day, 
and from 45 to 50 degrees by night. Use 
fires occasionally in the daytime in dull 
weather, to keep the house free from damp. 

Ventilation. — Give all the air consistent 
with the above temperature in fine weather ; 
close the house early. 

Watering. — Moisture should be applied 
very sparingly, even to plants in bloom, and 
it should always be used at, or rather above, 
the temperature of the house. Avoid syring- 
ing or damping the house unnecessarily by 
slopping water about. 

Arrangement. — Continue to alter the ar- 
rangement of the flowering plants as much as 
possible. Good effects may be produced by 
attending to the grouping of the various forced 
flowers as they are brought in. Masses of 
these, either separately or in combination with 
the other plants, may be so arranged as to 
give quite a fresh character to the house, es- 
pecially as they become more numerous. 

General Directions. — Strictly attend to the 
neat keeping of the house and plants, espe- 
cially in removing the decaying leaves from 
those which are more liable to lose them now. 
Do this by pinching or cutting off the leaf, 
and not by twisting or tearing the leaf-stalk 
down the shoot, by which practice the bark is 
frequently lacerated, and the plant materially 
damaged. Cut off all flowers as soon as they 
are past their prime, as they are sure to damp 
and perhaps rot the shoots and foliage near 
them if not removed early. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature, from 60 to 65 degrees by 
day, and 50 to 55 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Carefully regulate the admis- 
sion of air by the external temperature ; and 



also with regard to the heat necessary to be 
maintained. Fires will be necessary as soon 
as the weather becomes cold and damp, but 
they should be applied very gradually, in order 
to avoid exciting the plants too soon. 

Watering. — Use water with great caution, 
giving little or none to such bulbs, succulents, 
and other plants as are in a state of rest, and 
supplying those in a more active state with 
less, as the weather becomes dull and cold. 

Potting. — Pot such as may require it, 
especially bulbs or tubers just starting, using 
the smallest pots possible, in order to avoid 
damp. 

Insects. — Attend to former directions, 
allowing no rest to any depredators. Look 
close after wood lice, which often secrete 
themselves about young and tender roots. 

Achimenes. — Shift such as are growing, 
and pot more as a succession, placing them in 
a mild bottom heat, and watering sparingly 
until they are advancing rapidly. Use a light 
compost of peat, leaf mould, and sand, drain- 
ing the pots thoroughly. 

Allamanda, Beaumontia, Echites, and all 
strong growing climbers, should be kept in a 
state of rest, being supplied with very little 
water, and kept in a warm part of the house. 

Alpinias, Sedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, should receive the same treatment as 
last month, giving little or no water as the 
foliage dies down. 

Amaryllicls. — Pot such as throw up their 
flower stems, and advance them slowly. Keep 
all that will keep down, out until the spring. 

Aphelandras, Justiciar, Ruellias, &c. — 
Withhold water as the plants show symptoms 
of rest, and place them in a cool situation. 
Such as are now flowering or advancing 
should be more liberally watered and kept 
in a warmer position. 

Begonias. — Steadily advance such as are 
growing, but keep the others dormant, by 
placing them in a cool dry situation. 

BurchelUa. — Keep cool and dry; small 
well-ripened plants may be excited by extra 
heat and moisture to flower early. 

Cacti. — Keep up a succession by placing a 
few more in heat, and gradually increase the 
supply of water ; the others should still be 
kept cool, and have no more moisture than 
just enough to keep them alive, and not too 
plump. 

Cinnamomum ( Cinnamon tree) . — Use water 
with great caution, and keep the plants in the 
warmest part of the house. 

Clerodenclrons. — Cut in and remove to a 
cooler house as they go out of flower. These 
plants are very subject to the mealybug — now 
is the time to clear any that are infested. 

Climbers. — Those that flower early should 
now be pruned, thinned, and tied up ; clear

them from insects, old ties, and all unsightly 
leaves and scraggy branches. 

Daturas should be well rested by with- 
holding water, as on the wood being well 
ripened depends the next season's growth and 
flowering. 

Erythrinas. — Keep them cool and dry, and 
cut down the old stems as they decay. 

Euphorbias. — Keep the succulent species 
dry. E. jacquinijiora will now be in bloom or 
coming on; it should therefore be treated more 
liberally, and well exposed to the light. 

Ferns. — Continue to guard against excess 
of damp, especially to those whose fronds die 
down. Allow a freer circulation of air among 
the plants generally. 

Gardenias.' — Place more in bottom heat for 
early flowering, keeping a moist regular atmo- 
sphere about the plants, as well as at the 
roots. 

, Gem-eras, Gloxinias, &c. — Those at rest 
must still be kept so in a cool, airy place, and 
such as are growing and flowering should re- 
ceive sufficient heat and moisture to maintain 
them in a vigorous state. 

Hippeastrums, Crinums, Pancratiums, &c. 
— Keep these plants as much at rest as 
possible, but so that they do not lose their leaves. 

Ipomceas. — Keep cool, so as to prevent 
their making long straggling shoots ; the tube- 
rous species should be entirely at rest. 

Ixoras. — Keep them rather cool and airy, 
giving very little water, so as to rest them 
perfectly : clear them now of insects. 

Jasmimims, JRondeletias, Brunfelsias. — 
A few of each, that have been thoroughly 
rested, may be placed in heat for the sake of 
early flowers ; keep the others comparatively 
dry and cool. 

Lantanas. — Keep at rest ; if any are grow- 
ing, top them into the desired form and size. 

Luculia gratissima. — A cool airy situation, 
with a small supply of water, will do for this 
plant now. 

Lycopodiums. — Keep damp, but not to the 
extent previously required. 

Malvaceous Plants, as hibiscus, must be 
brought to a decided rest, if not already done. 
Clear away the leaves and half-ripened shoots 
as they decay. 

Manettias, and other tender climbers, 
should be kept cool, so as to become rested, 
and cut them in as they require it; they 
should also be carefully freed from insects 
while in a comparatively dormant state. 

Melastomas. — Attend to previous hints, 
and keep the plants as quiet as possible during 
the gloomy winter months. 

Melo-Cacti should be kept dry and dor- 
mant ; a mild regular temperature suits them 
best at this period. 

Musas should be kept as dormant as pos- 



sible, but in a warm situation, as cold or 
damp speedily injures them. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher-plant). — Keep it warm, 
and comparatively dry, guarding carefully 
against stagnant water about the roots. 

Neriums. — Keep them cool, and rather 
dry ; where the stock is numerous a few may 
be sent to the forcing house. 

Nymphceas (Water lilies). — Attend to pre- 
vious directions, keeping the roots rather dry. 

Palms require a steady, rather dry atmo- 
sphere ; keep the foliage clean, and water 
sufficiently to prevent them from flagging — 
no more. 

Thuribergias. — Keep the perennial sorts at 
rest as near as possible, and cut back such as 
require it. 

Vincas. — Cut back such as are at rest ; keep 
them so, by removing them to a cooler house. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm house for the 
Indian species 65 to 70 degrees by day, 60 
degrees by night ; the cool, or Mexican house, 
60 degrees by day, and 55 degrees by night. 
Let the range be rather lower in cold bright 
weather. 

Ventilation. — Little or no air must be given 
except in very favourable weather, when a 
little may be admitted among the plants at rest, 
especially in the cool house. Close the house 
very early in the afternoon, and see that the 
fires are sufficient to maintain the requisite 
heat. 

Watering . — Use water with the greatest 
caution, especially in dull weather. The 
syringe should not be used to the plants except 
slightly in very favourable weather. 

Insects. — Maintain a constant watch for the 
ravages of all vermin, especially for small 
snails and slugs, which are nearly always in a 
state of activity, owing to the temperature of 
the house. 

Potting. — Shift such as require it before 
they are too far advanced in growth, being 
careful not to put too much mould or moss 
over or among the young roots. 

Shading may be entirely dispensed with. 

Soils. — Attend to previous directions, and 
continue to collect as opportunity occurs. 

Imported Plants, if recently received, 
should be kept cool, so as not to commence 
their growth until a more favourable season. 
Such as are progressing should be removed to 
a slight increase of heat. 

Aerides, Saccolabiums, and Vandas, as they 
complete their growth should be allowed to 
rest, receiving no more water than just suffi- 
cient to prevent the leaves from being injured. 

Cymbidiums. — Allow these to rest in a 
similar way to the above, but giving a greater 
quantity of water when necessary. 



FRUIT TREES AND THEIR CULTURE. 



489 



Cattleyas, as they complete their growth, 
should be removed to the coolest part of the 
cool house, and receive little or no water. 

Dendrobiums should be removed to a cool 
airy part of the house, in order to harden 
their shoots ; water very little. 



Oncidiums. — Place them in an airy situation 
as they complete their growth, and water very 
sparingly at the mere roots. 

Stanhopeas. — Apply water very cautiously, 
as the thick fleshy roots are very impatient of 
moisture at this season of the year. 



FRUIT TREES AND THEIR CULTURE. 



Although this subject might be divided 
into twenty different papers for the purpose 
of giving the details of management necessary 
to so many different subjects as there are 
fruits, there are certain general principles 
which bear upon all, and which we seem now 
more disposed to treat of than minor points, 
because they affect all more or less, and may 
be taken as a foundation for general fruit 
culture. We start with a theory that may 
not be acceptable to the German dogma of 
Morphology, which, as explained by modern 
writers in its behalf, implies nothing more 
nor less than that flowers are metamorphosed 
leaves, and fruit stunted branches, because we 
deny that any one organ alters into another 
organ, and affirm, that plants are naturally 
as perfect as animals, and that a leaf no more 
alters to a flower, nor a branch to a fruit, than 
an arm alters to a leg, or a finger to a thumb. 
It is not our purpose to refute the nonsense 
which enforces these dogmas by an appeal to 
those specimens which exhibit one organ in 
the place usually occupied by another. It is 
sufficient for our purpose to appeal also to 
animal specimens, where a leg is seen in the 
place of an arm, and various other mon- 
strosities in which the ordinary purposes of 
nature seem prevented. Our theory, founded 
on unerring fact, is, that in any atom of a 
plant, there are the germs of leaves, branches, 
flowers, and fruit ; that suffered to grow in 
its usual way, all these take their places with 
the regularity and precision of all organized 
subjects ; that while the plant is young and 
vigorous, and the sap in the peculiar state 
which the proportion the root bears to the tree 
requires, the germs of leaves and branches are 
alone excited, and those of fruit and flowers 
are quiescent ; and that when the tree attains 
maturity, the sap changes its character, the 
germs of flowers and fruit are excited, and 
come as a matter of course ; the plant is per- 
fected by the production of the fruit, and the 
seeds in due time. The change in the sap as 
the tree attains its maturity arises out of the 
difference of supply, that being in proportion 
to the size of the tree, and the capacity of the 
root, and the effect of the sun and air being 
to thicken or elaborate the lessened quantity. 
From this we maintain, that giving exciting 
matter to increase the capacity of the root, or 



cutting the tree smaller to diminish its wants, 
will again induce the growth of leaves and 
branches, and that cutting away the roots 
when a tree was in full vigour, would so di- 
minish the supply of sap as to produce the 
necessary change at an earlier period, and 
induce the production of flowers and fruit. 
We establish all these things on unquestion- 
able proof, and upon that ground our manage- 
ment of fruit trees. There are various modes, 
however, of reducing the supply of sap : some 
have effected it by what is termed ringing 
the bark, that is, cutting away the bark all 
round the stem, or of a single branch, a certain 
width, from half an inch wide on small 
branches to two inches wide on a trunk : this 
has been known to have the effect on the 
part beyond or above the ring. But to pro- 
duce any effect upon the whole tree, there is 
nothing so good as pruning the root itself; 
and if it is desirable to fruit the tree very 
young, occasional removals are desirable. In 
some cases the effect is produced by grafting 
on a stock which naturally gives less sap than 
the sort grafted on it would take up. In read- 
ing books of old practice, and considering the 
various means by which fruit is produced, 
every expedient is founded on the same de- 
sign, — that of lessening the supply of sap. We 
see nothing to recommend in any of them. 
Some bend the branches so suddenly as to 
cause an interruption to the circulation of the 
sap, and, thereby, lessen the quantity beyond 
the bend. All these things, however, merely 
confirm our notion, that the whole art of 
making trees bear out of their natural course, 
consists in imitating the conditions of matu- 
rity as closely as possible. Proofs are at hand 
for any body who will take the trouble. Take 
a young tree of any kind, — a dwarf cherry, or 
pear or apple tree, and plant it in a pot ; as 
soon as the roots fill the pot, and the supply of 
nourishment is thereby lessened, it will begin 
to bloom and bear fruit ; by these means, trees 
not two feet high, in pots of a foot across, are 
obtained loaded with blossom, and bearing as 
much fruit as the capacity of the root will 
supply nourishment for ; and if there be more 
than ought to be ripened on so small a tree, 
they should be thinned, otherwise a number 
will fall for lack of support, and those which 
remain on the tree Avill be smaller than the 



490 



FRUIT TREES AND THEIR CULTURE. 



natural size. But suppose, instead of a pot 
being used at all, the root be sufficiently 
pruned, and it be planted in the open ground, 
it -will bear as early ; and as the root will, if 
long in the ground, grow rapidly, and soon 
excite growth instead of fruit, the tree must 
be pruned again at the root, and replenished 
to keep it bearing. After which second 
pruning, it may continue to bear, because the 
head having grown sufficiently beyond the root 
to keep its advantage, the root will not be 
able to surpass in growth and capacity the 
power of the tree itself. In general, there is 
too little consideration in planting trees. The 
nature of the soil, the situation, the natural 
means of supplying nutriment, and other 
circumstances, should always be considered, 
yet they are for the most part neglected 
by those who furnish their own gardens. In 
cases where people wish to do more than their 
neighbours, they will dig holes for fruit trees, 
and fill up with rich composts, causing the 
trees to grow vigorously so long as any of the 
artificial nutriment remains ; and during all 
that period, the germs of leaves and branches 
are alone excited, and the complaint is, that 
they will not bear fruit. "When, in the course 
of years this soil has given out the superfluity 
of nourishment, and the supply is lessened, 
the trees begin to bear, and that profusely. 

Those who have had much to do with fruit- 
trees against houses, will have observed that 
some will go all to wood for years, and scarcely 
bear a flower or fruit. This has often per- 
plexed the owners, and we have repeatedly 
known them to be cut down in despair of their 
ever bearing, when perhaps another two or 
three years Avould so far mature them as to 
make amends for the past by heavy crops. In 
such a case as this, we should dig down to the 
roots, and examine them ; if there were any 
tap root, we should begin our experiment by 
cutting it off, that is, by cutting right through 
it without wanting to remove it, nor should 
we cut it too close up to the tree, because it 
is not unlikely that it may be the chief sup- 
port of the plant. This, however, would be 
the result of carelessness in planting, because 
all downright or tap roots ought to have been 
cut off at the planting time. If, on the con- 
trary, w r e found spreading roots running out 
very strong, we should remove the ground to 
some distance, and cut the strongest through. 
so as to shorten it considerably ; and if this 
happened to be the chief one, it might be a suf- 
ficient check. The result of this must be to 
throw the tree into bearing, or kill it, but by 
taking pains to expose the principal roots, we 
may easily see their extent, and by shortening 
two or three of the most rambling, we may 
do all that is desired. It is quite certain that 
when the sap is in quantity, and quality, 



(which depends on quantity,) fit for the excite- 
ment of the germ of flowers and fruit, it is less 
exciting to those of leaves and branches, and 
any sudden change which fits it for one, unfits 
it for the other. Thus, suppose two trees 
were full of blossom buds, the effect of well 
elaborated sap of the previous summer, remove 
some of the soil to form a trench three or four 
feet from the stem, or more distant if a 
large tree, and fill that up with strong liquid 
manure, so that it shall reach the fibres 
of the roots to the end of them all round, 
and it will so alter the supply of sap as 
to excite the germs of leaves and branches, 
instead of letting the bloom and fruit 
take their natural course; they are blighted 
in embryo, leaves and branches alone grow, 
the others fall away in dust almost imper- 
ceptible, the sheath that enclosed them 
as well as the previously latent germs of 
flowers and fruit opens to disclose a new 
branch instead of the now blighted flowers. 
Now, in all cases of monstrous flowers and 
plants, the monstrosity has been occasioned 
by some rapid change of condition such as 
we have mentioned ; that is to say, by some 
sudden excitement causing a struggle be- 
tween the incipient organs for the mastery. 
If the blooming process is too forward to be 
actually destroyed, and is only partially 
blighted, there will frequently be seen half 
blossoms and bits of flowers. In the case of 
roses, the leafy process may be excited enough 
to push through the flower, and the bloom 
will be found actually surrounding a branch 
which has so protruded. In many other sub- 
jects similar deformities arise, not from the 
changing of one organ into another, but from 
the excitement of opposite organs which grow 
and displace others which do not. When it is 
considered that the germ of a whole tree is 
contained in a seed, the germ of branches 
in a bud, — that in fact microscopic powers of 
the highest degree simply show us a crowd of 
atoms in a plant, there is nothing extraordi- 
nary in the fact that, through some organs 
being half blighted, and others being unnatu- 
rally excited, leaves displace flowers, force 
themselves out of character, and occasionally 
produce odd combinations ; nay, in some in- 
stances, the germs fracture one another, and 
it is nothing very extraordinary to see por- 
tions of leaves fairly grafted to portions of 
petals ; but in fruit trees, generally speaking, 
the growth of the buds which are denomi- 
nated fruit buds, into flowers and fruit, is 
alike all over the tree, or, if excited by the 
means we have pointed out, before it is too 
far advanced, the growth of leaves, and the 
blight of the embryo flowers and fruit are as 
universal. It follows then, that when the 
trees once begin to bear, they continue to do so, 



FRUIT TREES AND THEIR CULTURE. 



491 



unless blights destroy the blossom or the fruit 
after setting, in which case, there being no fruit 
to take up the nourishment which the tree has 
provided, the germs of leaves and branches 
are excited, and there is a much more rapid 
growth than there would have been had the 
fruit remained on. So also, it may be observed, 
that while excess of sap is provided for the 
rapid growth of branches, the trees will not 
begin to bear fruit, and this is sometimes 
manifested in a curious manner by twenty 
years of growth before a fruit is borne. The 
case we have cited, and the proposed cure, 
demonstrate this. 

In planting fruit trees to form an orchard, 
some regard should be had to the soil, for it 
is better to sacrifice a little convenience in 
the plan of the orchard to secure good loamy 
soil, than to study convenience only, and 
entail the expense of making the ground, 
which must be looked upon as a temporary 
measure, securing present good but not per- 
manent benefit. If the loam be pretty deep 
and tolerably good, plant without any addition 
whatever. If it be shallow, there must be 
holes made, and the soil that is good thrown 
on one side to be used again, while the hun- 
gry or sour stuff may be thrown out on the 
other side to be rejected altogether. These 
holes ought to be four feet across and two 
feet deep, and the good soil should be re- 
turned into them, and they may be filled up 
with the top spit or half spit taken from all 
round about the hole, and, if necessary, all 
over the ground, and the sour or hungry re- 
jected soil should be spread abroad in its 
place. The holes being made at the distances 
intended for the trees, which may be close or 
wide apart according to the wish of the owner, 
should be in straight rows, say twenty to 
twenty-five feet apart in the row, and the 
rows from thirty to forty yards from each 
other. A tree should be planted in the middle 
of each, and they -should be procured^ from 
the nurseries with all their roots about them 
undamaged. It is necessary to examine the 
roots, to cut off all the bruised ends, to shorten 
all vigorous shoots, and especially to remove 
any root that may be growing downwards, as 
it would naturally grow directly downwards, 
and become a tap root ; cut such roots pretty 
close up to the bottom of the tree, remove 
also, or shorten, all straggling or vigorous 
shoots from the head, first to bring it into 
regular and proper shape, and, secondly, to 
lessen the quantity of growth to be sustained; 
cut out also all thin and weak shoots, for they 
are useless, and militate against a good whole- 
some growth. The trees thus prepared may 
be planted in the centre of each hole, always 
premising that the soil has been allowed to 
settle down properly. All planting should be 



shallow ; the nearer the surface the roots 
grow the better, so that they are fairly 
covered, for they will grow downwards fast 
enough. If it be an object to throw the tree 
into bearing early without reference to the 
ultimate growth of the tree, the root may be 
pruned in pretty freely; but a moderate 
pruning is the best, such as shortening any 
of the strong portions which seem inclined to 
ramble, and always cutting off any portions 
inclined to form tap or carrot-looking roots. 
This is sufficient in general. "When the tree is 
planted a hole should be opened larger than 
the root, but very shallow, and shallowest in 
the middle ; in fact, the bottom ought to be 
rising in the middle. The roots then slope 
downwards all round, and the soil may be 
filled in, so as to go between all the roots and 
to cover them, when the earth should be trod- 
den firmly down. In addition to the treading 
the plants in firmly, there should be three 
stakes driven into the ground two feet from 
the tree, and sloping so as to press the trunk ; 
and where these three stakes press the trunk 
they should be tied firmly, placing, however, 
some hay or straw next the trunk, that the 
bark may not be damaged by pressure. These 
will effectually prevent the root from being 
disturbed by the wind, which would other- 
wise blow the trees about and perhaps destroy 
them altogether, for the small roots would be 
broken off and greatly damaged ; even if they 
were placed right again on the ground, the 
slightest wind would again disturb them. 
These trees would make considerable growth 
the first season. It is desirable to watch this 
growth, and if any branch is growing more 
vigorously than the rest, and running away, 
as it were, from a proper growth, remove it 
altogether if it can be spared, or shorten it if 
it cannot be spared. If there is much growth 
of small twig-like shoots, remove some or all ; 
the object is to let the head grow of a goodly 
form, spreading equally all round, and if any 
branches cross each other, or are too close, 
one should be removed to give room. Also, 
if the shoots grow inwards, and would crowd 
the head, let such be cut away, or rubbed off 
while young, for unless trees are open enough 
to let in sun and air the fruit will not come 
fine, and all this applies to every fruit tree. 
The trees will make vigorous growth, as the 
soil cannot fail to agree with them if it all 
consists of the top spit or half spit of even 
ordinary mould. Perhaps the most easy 
method of setting about an orchard, when you 
are obliged to use the surface to fill up holes 
and spread the bad stuff on the surface, is, to 
rob it a little all round each hole : say the hole 
is four feet across and two feet six inches 
deep, first throw back the top spit of the hole 
itself, and then dig the top spit off all round 



492 



ANALYSIS OF MANURES. 



the hole a foot or two feet in width, or more, 
if necessary, throwing it inward till you have 
raised the stuff in the hole pz-etty nearly a 
foot higher than it was originally, to allow 
for settling, and then the rough bad stuff will 
be round the tree, but completely under the 
head, where very little would grow even if 
the soil were good. This prevents the rest 
of the soil from being disturbed, and for all 
the good the ground immediately under a 
tree does, there is nothing lost. In after 
growths of the trees the same caution should 
be observed in preventing branches from 
crossing each other, or from growing too 
vigorously and out of form. Few people take 
this pains with standard fruit trees, but it is 
as desirable and as necessary as the training 
and pruning of wall fruit trees ; and they pay 
quite as well for the care it takes to look after 
them properly. 

Trees will begin to bear sometimes in 
three years, but much depends on their state 
when they were planted. The stakes which 
are placed to prevent them from shifting 
when planted may be removed after the first 
season's growth, as the ties would be apt to 
injure the bark if kept on too long. The 
ground between the trees is best laid down in 
grass ; it is any way best for an orchard, but 
of course, if it be wanted for cropping, two 
things are to be minded, one is that the 
ground is not disturbed round each tree, so 
far as the good ground and the bad ground 
beyond it reaches, for the soil would bring 
nothing perfect nor worth notice. 

ANALYSIS OP VARIOUS MANURES. 
Notwithstanding all that has been written 
and said of the various manures which are 
used in the dressing of land, and their effects 
upon crops, scarcely two chemists give the 
same analysis of any compound body, and this 
chiefly because they give the result in diffe- 
rent states, some intelligible, some not, but all 
various. We can hardly illustrate this better 
than by quoting Dr. Ure's analysis of Guano, 
and Voelckel's. The former is as follows : —

We are not now going to allude to the dis- 
crepancy of the quantities, because that does 
not affect the question, but to the discrepancies 
of the terms and the nature of the results. 
Why are not the same tests applied and the 
same items mentioned ? How can any farmer 
or person in any other class not versed in 
chemical affinities and the nature of them, 
imagine that these two results are of the same 
article ? It is as if scientific men were deter- 
mined that common people should never 
understand them. One of these chemists pro- 
duces no less than eleven different items or 
materials ; the other sums up the qualities 
of guano in five. Can this be right ? that is 
to say, can it be right for the guidance of in- 
experience ? One more illustration of this 
and we have done : take the subject of cow 
dung. Three analyses of this animal manure 
by three different chemists are thus given : — 

The author of the Muck Manual says, 
the proportions of organic matter, water, and 
salts, in lOOlbs. of cow dung, are —

* This is wrong in the addition, because the sum 
should be 100-46, consequently there is 46 over instead 
of a loss of 14. However, this is not material, except 
that it shows carelessness somewhere, but does not 
affect our object, which is to show that hardly two 
chemists agree in their terms, to say nothing of pro- 
portions.

With these discrepancies before us, how 
can it be expected that we, the uninitiated in 
the mysteries of chemistry, can arrive at any 
conclusion as to the value of cow dung as a 
manure ? The amount of water in cow dung 
is very large, and it is said to be the least 
valuable of animal manures, although used as a 
standard, much in the same way as copper coin 
might be used as a standard for the value of the 
better metals ; but nothing could be more un- 
certain than cow dung, in consequence of its 
large quantity of water, because if exposed it 
would not be of the same value two days together. 
The water would evaporate, consequently 
dried cow dung having lost the greater part 
of its water would become a much more 
valuable manure. The author of the Muck 
Manual says, that without violence to chemistry 
the composition of cow dung may be stated as 
follows : — 

Geine 15*45 

Salts -95 

Water 83 60 

100 00 

Proceeding in the same chemical expression 
and classification of contents, the following 
are the results of several other manures : — 



* This is as it appears in print, but it is wrongly 
added, because the sum is 99-80. However, this affects 
not our objection to the strange want of uniformity in 
the terms of the various results.

It is not so stated, but doubtless the deficiency 
in the hundred parts is loss ; but the value of 
manure consists in its capacity to produce 
ammonia, of which we shall offer a notice 
presently. Night soil by analysis yields 

Geine 235 

Salts 1-2 

Water 75-3

We are informed then by Mr. Falkner, that 
the following are the ultimate results of the 
three manures : — 1001b. cow dung will yield 
of carbonate of ammonia about 21b. 2oz., horse 
dung 31b. and nearly a quarter, and night soil 
151b. and nearly a third. The presence of 
nitrogen, which regulates the capacity of a 
manure to produce ammonia, determines the 
true value of the article, inasmuch as, by uniting 
with hydrogen, it produces pure ammonia. As 
a passing remark, we may observe that pig 
dung is supposed to be upon an equality with 
night soil ; but it must always be recollected 
that a difference of food makes a difference in 
the relative qualities of the dung of all ani- 
mals. The experiments undertaken by the 
Prussian authorities, to ascertain whether the 
contents of the sewers of Berlin and Dres- 
den could be applied to fertilizing the adjacent 
land, seems to prove that if land unmanured 
produced three bushels for one sown, then ■ — 

Cow dung would produce ... 7 

Horse dung 10 

And night soil 14 

But it is not in sewers, which are receptacles 
for every thing, that night soil could be had 
in its unmixed state, and consequently we may 
consider that as underrated in value. 

Poudret, which is a preparation of night 
soil, good or bad according to the honesty of 
the manufacturer, is ranked with guano, but 
next to night soil. The value of poudret 
depends on whether the ammonia is lost or 
saved. " If night soil be mixed with sulphate 
or muriate of lime before drying, the volatile 
carbonate of ammonia will be changed into 
sulphate of ammonia and sal ammoniac. Thus 
not only the most valuable portion of night 
soil will be retained, but the salts of lime will 
be much increased. The mixture will be 
perfectly inoffensive, and allowing ground 
peat and plastic with the other salts to form 
one half of the dry mixture, there is then in 
every lOOlbs. fertilizing proportions equal to 



494 



ANALYSIS OF MANURES. 



200lbs. of the moist human excrement, and the 
value of good poudret is as compared with 
cow duug as 14 to 1. Another kind of pou- 
dret is prepared in France by boiling the offal 
of the slaughter-house by steam into a thick 
soup, and mixing the whole into a stiff paste 
with sifted coal ashes and drying it. But 
perhaps soot is the most powerful of all 
manures. Its analysis is as under : — 

Geine 30-70 

Nitrogen 20-00 

Salts of lime, mostly chalk . . 25-31 

Bone dust 1*50 

Salts of potash andsoda, and ammonia 6*14 

Carbon 385 

Water 1250 

100-00 



The salts, therefore, in 100 lbs. of soot are 
equal to a ton of cow dung. But among the 
subjects of regret to all who give themselves 
the trouble of thinking about such matters, 
that of wasting the liquid evacuations of ani- 
mals is perhaps the most remarkable. The 
salts therein contained are beyond measure 
valuable ; yet how rarely are they appropri- 
ated ! how common is it for this and the 
drainings of the dungyard to run to waste ! 
Let us look a little to their composition and 
to their fertilizing qualities, and compare 
them with the analyses we have already 
quoted. We shall still keep to the authority of 
the Much Manual, the most useful work that 
has emanated from the press on the subject. 
That of the cow contains : — 

Water 65 

Urea 5 

Bone dust 5 

Sal ammoniac and muriate of potash 15 

Sulphate of potash 6 

Carbonate of potash and ammonia . 4 

100 



Compare this with the dung of the cow. 
It appears already that 100 lbs. of dung afford 
2 lbs. 2oz. of carbonate of ammonia, while this 
gives 5 lbs. of ammonia in its urea, and nearly 
three times 5 lbs. in its other ammoniacal 
salts; in short, 100 lbs. afford 35 lbs. of the 
most powerful salts ever used by farmers. 

The liquid evacuation of the horse con- 
tains : — 

Water 94-0 

Urea *7 

Chalk 1-1 

Carbonate of soda *9 

Hippurate of soda 2-4 

Muriate of potash -9 

100-0 



It is thus equal in value to cow-dung, pound 
for pound ; but when we come to the subject of 
waste, the author of the Muck Manual tells 
us that every man wastes annually enough 
salts to manure an acre of ground. The liquid 
evacuations are equal in value to that of the 
cow : the analysis is not in all respects the 
same, but the value is. According to Dr. 
Thompson's analysis, the contents of 1,000 lbs. 
are more than 42 lbs. of salts, for there is not 
an ingredient that is not essential to plants. 
The analysis is as follows : — 

Sal ammoniac -459 

Sulphate of potash .... 2-112 

Muriate of potash .... 3 -674 

Common salt 5-060 

Phosphate of soda .... 4-267 

Bone dust, phosphate of lime . '209 

Acetate of soda 2-770 

Urate of ammonia .... "298 

Urea, with colouring matter . 23-640 

Water 967-511 

1,000-000 

Wrong cast, because these make up 1,010 
instead of 1,000 ; but we suspect that the 
contents are right in all the essentials, and 
that the error is in putting down the defi- 
ciency as water, which is probably in the 
original not stated other than in words — 
"rest water." It is not, therefore, of any 
consequence as regards the value as a ferti- 
lizing matter. 54 bushels of soot and 6 lbs. 
of salt produced larger crops of both the 
Altringham and Belgian white carrots than 
24 tons of stable manure and 24 bushels of 
bones, though at half the cost. We cannot 
help wishing that there were some uniformity 
in the mode of recording the contents of any 
thing analysed, that we might be better able 
by comparison to judge the value, and have 
more confidence in the gentlemen who under- 
take such tasks. It is greatly to be regretted 
that persons affording information cannot 
understand why one man should produce one 
set of combinations, and another chemist bring 
out another, when the two articles are the 
same ; but so it is, and we have seen nothing 
yet to reconcile us to the discrepancies which 
we have shown in the various analyses of 
guano and of cow manure. There is nothing 
like uniformity of terms, nor any thing recon- 
cileable to common people, in the fact of one 
giving a greater number of particulars than 
another ; and we take leave to remind these 
gentlemen chemists that nothing tends to ad- 
vance science so much as uniformity among 
the teachers and professors, and their pub- 
lished opinions. Different terms may in some 
instances mean the same thing, but analyses

made and published for general information 
ought to be all reported in the same language 
and terms, and the particulars given under 
the same heads. If professors would but re- 
member that they are writing for the public, 
and not exclusively for one another, it would 
be useful to them, and lead them to be intelli- 
gible in their lessons, that the public might 
learn with facility, and study with profit and 
advantage. 

CHEMICAL AND OTHER MANURES. 

There are so many ways of applying ma- 
nure, that the quantity to be given is very 
problematical. He who sows the manure with 
the seeds does not use the quantity which is 
necessary when the whole ground is to be 
fertilized. Chemical manures, and those 
which are rapidly soluble, should not be put 
in much below the surface, because the rains 
wash it down quite low enough ; and if we 
might advise, we should recommend all ma- 
nures to be generally instead of partially 
applied, because you can better calculate the 
heart in the ground than when the crop is 
made to clear off all the fertilizing qualities in 
the first season. We dislike all temporary 
fertilizers, and all temporary applications of 
permanent manures. When the ground is all 
alike, there is some calculation of what it can 
do, and what it requires ; but when the fer- 
tilizer is confined to the ridge which is sown, 
and the other portions of the ground go with- 
out, there is no drawing a fair conclusion. 
We know the doctrine preached is that of 
putting on only what the crop will take off, 
and then the ground is alike after the crop is 
gone. Experience do'es not justify this. Try 
the experiment ; plant or sow on the drill, 
and between the drill, and see if they grow 
alike. Not a bit of it. Let the gardener 
apply his manure alike all over the piece, as 
if he were going to sow broadcast ; he can 
then always judge what it will require, or if 
it will require anything, for the next crop, 
much better than if he partially dressed just 
where his plants are to grow. Salts of all 
kinds and chemical manures should always be 
mixed with three, four, or five times their 
weight of sand or light earth, and then laid 
evenly over the surface. He may then fork it in 
with the top three or four inches ; and having 
given it a good soaking with water, it may be 
prepared at any time for sowing by merely 
raking the surface, and it is ready for planting 
without raking. 

All ground ought to be dug well before 
any of the chemical or easily soluble manures 
are applied, because it does not answer to put 
them in so deep as dung is usually put. But 
the most even way of applying soluble dress- 



ings is in water, sufficiently diluted that the 
soil may be equally wetted three or four 
inches deep. 

Among the popular manures of the present 
day there are many Avhich are efficacious or 
mischievous according to the quantity. Salt, 
for instance, may be applied at the rate of 
3 cwt. per acre with advantage; but Mr. 
Johnson says it may be given at the rate of 
12 cwt. We know that crops have been 
killed with less, but that says nothing. Alum, 
by the same authority, must only be given at 
the rate of 40 lbs. per acre. Bone dust, or 
calcined bones, a ton and a half as the maxi- 
mum, half the quantity as a minimum. Car- 
bonate of ammonia, 160 lbs.; carbonate of 
soda, from 160 to 640 lbs. (a wide difference) ; 
Daniels' Bristol manure, half a ton ; graves, 
half a ton ; gypsum, 40 lbs. ; Hunt's new fer- 
tilizer, 320 lbs. ; Liverpool animalized manur- 
ing powder, 27 cwt. ; muriate of ammonia, a 
pound to a rod ; muriate of lime, 2 lbs. ; 
nitrate of soda, 160 lbs. to the acre; pearl 
ash, 320 lbs. ; phosphate of ammonia, 160 lbs. ; 
rags, 3 cwt. to 12 cwt. ; rape cake and rape 
dust, 6 cwt. ; saltpetre, 1 60 lbs. ; sulphate of 
ammonia, the most useful of all perhaps in 
gardens, lib. to the square rod; sulphate of 
magnesia, 1 lb. ; sulphate of potash, 2 lbs. ; 
sulphate of soda, 2 lbs. ; superphosphate of 
lime, 80 lbs. per acre ; urate of London Ma- 
nure Company, 320 lbs. These are, in gene- 
ral, the quantities published on the authority 
of the dealers, and adopted by Mr. Johnson in 
1 844 ; but the improved methods of applying 
them, and the facilities with which the best 
article can be procured, instead of the spuri- 
ous, enable the cultivator to save from the 
quantities named, except when the article is 
distinct and alone, as sulphate of ammonia, or 
sulphate of magnesia. The mixtures sold by 
individuals and companies must be used ac- 
cording to the dealers' directions, because they 
alone know the strength. They are interested 
in telling us the best quantities, because ma- 
nuring being the most costly part of cultiva- 
tion, drives men to the best and cheapest mar- 
ket. Poittevin's disinfected manure, Potter's 
guano, Hunt's guano, Lane's carbon, Lane's 
humus, Law's patent manure, and some others, 
can only be appreciated after being used as 
directed by the vendors. They know the 
quantity most efficacious, taking price and 
usefulness into account. Many of these pre- 
pared manures are from night soil, the most 
valuable of all, if properly applied ; and it is 
to be regretted that a single shilling should be 
expended in imported manures while millions 
of pounds' worth of the soil in this country 
are washed away in rivers, to the detriment 
of the water and the loss of the state. As, 
however, nine-tenths of the community do not

know how to apply it, we will offer a few 
hints upon the subject. 

It is easily disinfected with sulphate or 
muriate of lime ; and if mixed with its hulk 
of peat earth and dried, it will be fit to trans- 
port any where, and will be found fourteen to 
one stronger than cow-dung. 




SALVIA CONFERTIFLORA. 

(Pohl) 
THE CROWDED FLOWERED SAGE. 

The family of Salvias is a very extensive I 
one, and embraces much diversity of aspect 
and character. Thus some species are truly j 
shrubby, a greater number belong to the class 
called soft -wooded, while others again are | 
truly herbaceous ; and then, again, some spe- 
cies are perfectly hardy, and others can 
hardly be grown to their proper perfection, 
except they are submitted, during at least a 
period of their growth, to the atmosphere of a 
stove. A very great number of these spe- 
cies must claim to be regarded as highly 
ornamental garden plants. 

Salvia confertrflora, though sub-shrubby, is, 
to a certain extent, herbaceous in its habit. It 
produces, in the growing season, very stout, 
vigorous, erect stems, which bear large, broadly- 
ovate rough opposite leaves, and close whorl- 
like aggregations of flowers, usually in strong 
specimens forming as it were spikes of bloom, 
of great length ; the individual flowers are 
not large, but, from the quantity of them 
produced, have a very showy appearance ; 
they are woolly, and of a bright orange-red 
colour. The ordinary blooming season is the 
autumn. It is a native of Rio Janeiro, from 
whence it appears to have been introduced by 
the Horticultural Society of London. 



This is one of the plants that might be 
turned to account for late autumn flowering 
in the greenhouse. For this purpose its 
peculiar habit naturally adapts it, and, by 
proper management, this adaptation may be 
rendered more complete. To accomplish this, 
the plants should be kept from growing at 
too early a period of the spring ; the middle 
or end of April will be quite early enough, 
and some may be kept still later, if possible, 
by keeping them cool, and rather dry, in a 
north aspect. The plants may be started in 
cool frames, and afterwards grown out -doors 
during the summer ; or, if very large plants 
are required, they may be planted out in 
moderately rich ground for the summer, and 
then taken up very carefully and repotted in 
the autumn. There is, however, much risk 
in this plan, unless very expertly managed, 
and, on the whole, it is safer to grow the 
plants in pots throughout the summer. When 
taken up out of the ground, especially if the 
growth has been moderately luxuriant, the dis- 
turbing of the roots is almost certain to cause 
the plants to droop, and it not unfrequently 
happens from this that both the older leaves 
and the points of the shoots are lost, which is 
a great disfigurement. There is at the same 
time an advantage in planting out, if vigorous 
growth is at all an object. Two methods may 
be employed to obviate the evil referred to : 
the plants may be kept in pots, and shifted 
as necessary from time to time, the pots being 
kept plunged in the soil of the open garden ; 
or, if the plants are not kept in pots, a spade 
may be thrust down all round them at a few 
inches distance, in order to cut the roots, and 
this may be done several times in the season. 
One great advantage in the plants being 
planted or plunged in the open ground is, 
that the roots are kept in a regular state as 




regards moisture — not sometimes saturated, 
and at other times parched ; this equally 
moistened condition enables the roots to make 
good progress, and, consequently, the plants 
gain strength and vigour. 

If they are grown in pots, they must be 
repotted progressively, as their roots increase, 
until the flowering stems have attained some 
height, after which their further growth may 



LINUM TRIGYNUM. 



497 



be promoted by careful watering, and the 
occasional use of liquid manure. A rich 
loamy soil is proper for them ; and the pots, 
being large, should be well drained. When 
once started, they ought not to receive a 
check during their progress, if a good de- 
velopment of flowers is expected ; therefore 
it is of the utmost importance that the supply 
of water be ample and regular. There is no 
necessity for nursing up the plants during 
this period; indeed, this would be highly in- 
jurious to them; it is much better for them 
to be fully exposed both to sun and air, in 
order that their growth may be robust rather 
than rapid. For the sake of variety, the 
stems of some may be stopped when they 
have grown a foot or so in length, in order 
to increase the number of stems ; this will 
most probably produce a double effect, for 
they will most likely not then bloom quite so 
early ; the spikes of flowers will by this 
means not be so fine and large, but there will 
be a greater number, and for the purpose of 
making a difference in the plants, it is desir- 
able that some should be so treated. 

In the autumn the plants must be carefully 
protected from frosts. Where there is the 
convenience, it is better to remove such 
plants as these and Chrysanthemums to a 
spare house, where they may have all possible 
ventilation by day, and the protection of the 
sashes at night. From hence they may be 
removed in succession to the greenhouse as 
their flowers are developed. After the middle 
of October, it is best not to water them too 
liberally, as in the low temperature of the 
greenhouse too much moisture about the 
plants — either at the stems or roots — will be 
liable to produce their decay. This should 
be borne in mind in reference to other freely- 
grown plants which are prepared for very 
late blooming. 

This Salvia should be propagated by cut- 
tings taken off in April or May, and planted 
singly in small pots, and set in a mild heat ; 
when rooted they may be shifted on precisely 
like the other plants, and ought to form good 
blooming specimens by the autumn. They 
will be useful for securing a later set of bloom. 
In managing the old plants, they should always 
be started so as to come into flower in suc- 
cession. 

LINUM TRIGYNUM. 

{Roxburgh.) 
THE THREE-STYLED FLAX. 

There are many of our old and almost for- 
gotten floral acquaintances, whose faces, when 
they are presented to us, like those of long 
absent friends, ever carry with them the pass- 
port to a welcome reception. Sometimes, 
too, as in human experience, our floral inti- 
48. 



macies are, as it were, consigned for a period 
to oblivion, whilst we are eagerly forming new 
alliances and acquaintances ; but these in 
course of time cease to interest us, and we are 
then content to renew our former friendships. 
This is a characteristic of humanity in its every 
phase ; but is, perhaps, nowhere more strik- 
ingly exemplified than in the choice and 




culture of flowers. Real intrinsic worth 
seems to be held at a discount, as compared 
with novelty ; and the consideration of the 
number rather than the nature of their floral 
friends and acquaintances, seems to bear sway 
over the generality of flower lovers. 

The old Lihum trigynum well illustrates 
this sentiment in its application to plant-cul- 
ture. Years ago one might see it frequently 
in cultivation ; and though in those days 
gardening had not reached its present per- 
fection, yet sufficient skill existed to render 
manifest in its appearance the elements of a 
showy and handsome plant. Since then it 
has been neglected, and almost forgotten — 
retained, it may be, only by chance in some 
unfrequented locality of the gardening world, 
from whence, at the best, it has but few oppor- 
tunities of being again disseminated as its 
merits deserve. It is a small greenhouse shrub, 
capable of being grown into a compact and 
well formed bush, of three or four feet high ; 
the leaves are evergreen, glaucous, moderate 
sized, and elliptical ; and the flowers are 
large, orange-yellow, and freely produced at 
and near the extremity of the shoots, and on 
little side shoots. The blooming season is 
various, throughout the summer and autumn, 
and the plants continue for a considerable 
period in bloom. It is a native of mountainous 
tracts in the north of India, whence it was 

K K 



498 



HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 



introduced to this countiy about 1784. In 
India it blooms in March and April ; and 
when kept in stoves, as it formerly was in this 
countiy, it produced its flowers in October, 
November, and December. 

Its cultivation is simple. The plant grows 
freely in any good loamy compost, such as is 
used for free-growing greenhouse plants. 
Cuttings taken off early in April strike root 
readily in sand, in a little beat ; these should 
be potted as soon as rooted into small pots, in 
a compost of equal parts loam, peat, and leaf 
mould, kept in a warm greenhouse or frame 
until established, and then at the usual season 
placed for the summer, with other greenhouse 
plants, in a sheltered place out of doors. In 
winter they must be* lodged in the green- 
house, and treated as proper inmates of that 
structure. From the first, the young plants 
should be often topped, to keep them bushy ; 
not more than two or three joints should be 
allowed to grow without topping, until the 
plant is formed, and then it may be allowed 
to grow more at large to ensure its flowering. 
The plants should of course be shifted from 
time to time, as the roots become numerous ; 
and if it be intended to produce a perfect 
plant, the roots must not be too much limited, 
but allowed fair scope. The compost for mature 
plants may be formed of equal parts loam and 
peat, lightened, if necessary, by adding sand ; 
and if moderately large pots are used, they 
must be well drained. In the summer season 
the plants may be set out of doors along with 
other greenhouse plants, and in the winter 
may occupy any convenient part of the green- 
house. They require at each of these periods 
respectively the usual care in watering, re- 
quiring much less, of course, in winter than 
in summer, and always when watered receiv- 
ing enough to thoroughly moisten the soil. 
The leaves are liable to be damaged by thrip 
and red spider, the best preventives of which 
consist in frequent syringings, and keeping a 
moist atmosphere. After they become affected, 
there is perhaps no better application than 
sulphur, which should be dusted over every 
part. 

HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 

THE ADVANTAGE OF AN ACKNOWLEDGED 
LEADING SOCIETY. 

In all classes comprising large bodies of 
people, there should be a head. No great 
community can hold together without it. In 
no case is the want of it so generally felt as in 
the five hundred societies which profess to 
promote floriculture and horticulture. Each 
views its neighbour with jealousy rather than 
emulation ; and members think infinitely 
more about upholding their individual society 



than of advancing the science. In our opinion, 
floriculture should be like freemasonry : all 
who wish well to it should be joined in one 
common brotherhood. Their care should be to 
act in unison. They should take their guide 
from some head society, some head board. 
Go where you will, you find the Freemasons 
all alike. The same principles guide them 
all ; and although there are some masonic 
bodies, or lodges, as they are called, which 
exact very large subscriptions, and others 
require very small ones ; although some com- 
prise among their members noblemen and 
wealthy persons, and others chiefly working 
men, all aim at one end, and hold the- same 
sentiments. Difference of subscription is to 
meet difference of station. Poor men are 
content to meet once a month at a frugal 
supper ; the more wealthy may choose their 
periodical dinners ; but the advancement of 
the order, the exercise of its benevolence, and 
the conservation of its principles, actuate all 
alike. There are no divisions, no dissensions, 
or at least such things have been very rare ; 
and our notions are, that the same leading 
principles should guide all floral societies. 
We think there should be a code of laws laid 
down for some central society, which should 
be looked up to, and these laws should form 
the fundamental rules of every society in the 
kingdom. These laws should apply to all 
localities and all circumstances, and branches 
should be formed all over the kingdom. 
There should be a tribute from the branches 
to the chief society, and for this tribute an 
equivalent should be given, either in the way 
of a medal, to award as a prize, or printed 
rules for distribution. It is not necessary to 
make the contributions from- the branch so- 
cieties large ; on the contrary, they should be 
small enough to come within every man's 
means. The branch societies should keep a 
register of the names and addresses of all 
their members, a copy of which register 
should be periodically transmitted to the 
central society. By these means there would 
in time be a sufficient number of members 
enrolled, under a solemn pledge to be honest, 
to be able to commence something like honour- 
able rivalry through the country. 

It will be obvious to the meanest capacity, 
that anything like uniformity in the rules of 
a hundred different societies, raised by persons 
of very different capacities, would be im- 
possible, except they were founded on one 
model ; and although there may be several 
ways of carrying an object out, they cannot 
be all equally good. With regard to the 
very foundation of a large community, the 
greatest attention must be paid. It is neces- 
sary that they should apply to all localities 
and all classes ; that they should be binding

equally on all ranks and under all circum- 
stances. For instance, there should be one 
rule, that the members of the society should 
be unlimited, and that they should be governed 
by a committee, elected by and from among 
themselves. Other rules should define the 
objects of the society, which should be the 
advancement of the science, by the award of 
prizes for the best productions shown by 
persons whose growth and property they are. 
These fundamental rules may also define the 
mode of electing officers, the times of election, 
the mode of appointing judges, and how they 
shall be qualified. The time for prizes, sub- 
scriptions, and mode of collecting or receiving 
them, and such other matters as are equally 
applicable to all places and all circumstances, 
should be accurately, carefully, and plainly 
laid down, so that, so far as the main prin- 
ciples are concerned, there should be uni- 
formity throughout the whole kingdom. The 
members of every branch should be obliged to 
declare, in the most unreserved manner, that 
they would abstain from all sorts of trickery 
themselves, and prevent it in others, so far 
as they could; that they would expose fraud 
and unfair dealing whenever it came under 
their notice ; that they would report, or cause 
to be reported, in the best way they could, 
all attempts to deceive, all instances of per- 
sons showing the productions of other people ; 
that they would do their best to make known 
all the best novelties that came under their 
notice, and promote the exhibition of such 
novelties at one or other of the branch shows, 
and wherever practicable to the London 
board, and also make known to the heads of 
their respective societies all attempts to put 
forth worthless subjects as superior produc- 
tions. That they should, in fact, pledge 
themselves as earnestly as possible to follow 
out the orders and intentions of the central 
board, that floriculture might be purged of its 
evils, the trade limited to those who became 
pledged equally themselves to do right, and, 
so far as in them lies, to prevent others 
from doing wrong. This kind of understand- 
ing, begun among only a few who were in 
earnest, would soon enrol all those who 
meant honestly, and enable amateur and pro- 
fessional florists to select those they proposed 
to deal with from such only as were members 
of the principal society or one of the branches. 
It w r ould cure the exhibitors in some of the 
great societies of collecting their fruit and 
flowers from a number of persons, and show- , 
ing the results as their own. It would pre- 
vent competitors from purchasing things at 
Covent-garden to get prizes at another garden. 
It would stop begging, borrowing, and steal- 
ing, to make up subjects for exhibition, and 
disheartening honourable persons, who, under 



the present system, see the utter hopelessness 
of contending against such mighty odds. It 
would check the growing evil of sending out 
a dozen varieties of anything, when only 
two or three are worth growing. It would 
enhance the value of the best things, and rid 
us of many that are useless. At present 
many societies so notoriously wink at the 
showing of other people's productions as 
the exhibitor's growth and property, that 
he who would show honestly may as well 
stay at home ; and the knowledge that such 
is the case, induces others, who would not 
otherwise think of such a thing, to imitate the 
example and out-Herod Herod. "We know 
one instance in which an individual's flowers, 
known to be good at all times, were excluded, 
because the owner had, to oblige a gardener, 
who never paid for it, parted from a rather 
scarce rose. The person thus excluded let 
two or three of the showers have his flowers, 
and they went in and beat all those who had 
been collecting them from all quarters. Such 
was the feeling, and such is the feeling still, 
in that society, that men, in other respects 
honourable, think it almost creditable to cheat 
the managers by showing other people's pro- 
ductions. It cannot, therefore, be too strongly 
recommended to those who wish to see the 
science upheld as respectable and worthy of 
support, to be moving in their several localities 
to get up something like a society pledged to 
be honest, and ready to co-operate with any 
central London establishment that may be 
founded for that purpose. It is a good time 
of year; and if there be any Freemasons, they 
may adopt one principle from that body with 
advantage, that of making every member's 
subscription pay a trifle to the head society ; if 
it be but sixpence a year, it would be advan- 
tageous. It makes all the members all over 
the country one general body, however dif- 
ferent may be their rank, station, subscription, 
the nature of their prizes, and the produce they 
emerge. If the members of a society pay a 
shilling a month, a halfpenny should be re- 
tained as the tribute, and the rest spent. If the 
subscription be a pound, the tribute should 
be the same, for it will pay for keeping the 
necessary registers, and enrolling all removals, 
deaths, and acquisitions of members in one 
register — for keeping up the communication 
with each other — and perhaps for printing, if 
necessary, the general register for the use of 
each separate branch. There is not a local 
society but might avail itself of this advan- 
tage, and the sooner it is reduced to some 
plan and system the better. However it be 
started, and by whatever society it be set on 
foot, it will have our support, because we 
believe some such thing to be necessary for 
the well being of the science of floriculture.

HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 



THE DUTY OF COMMITTEES. 

There is nothing upon which the success 
of Horticultural Science so much depends, as 
on the management of Societies established 
for its promotion. Nor is there any one thing 
so detrimental to it as the mismanagement 
of these establishments. It would be invidious 
and perhaps unwise to mention the names of 
any which have been open to objections ; and 
more particularly as so many deserve reproach, 
that it' we named those only which we know 
to be bad, we should omit many equally de- 
serving censure, simply because we do not 
know them. It would be well, therefore, if 
the Horticultural Societies all over the country 
would take as meant for themselves all that 
applies to their own particular cases. We 
must first make ourselves understood with 
regard to our ideas of the intentions with 
which these establishments were founded, and 
are supported; and this may be done in a few 
words. They are intended to promote the ad- 
vancement of horticultural science, and this 
brings us to the means by which they profess 
to accomplish their objects. They have to 
excite the emulation of gardeners and their 
employers, and also of amateurs who are 
neither the one nor the other. This they have 
attempted by public exhibitions, at which cul- 
tivators, professional and otherwise, are in- 
vited to show their best productions, for 
prizes, and at which the public may be gra- 
tified by witnessing the most beautiful subjects 
grown in the highest perfection. Now it 
requires no great penetration to see that the 
following ought to be something like the main 
points to be looked to for carrying out these 
objects. 

First, — To throw open all prizes to those 
subjects that should attract the greatest num- 
ber of competitors. 

Secondly, — To take care that the subjects 
themselves should for the most part be such 
as will most gratify the public. 

Thirdly, — To appoint for judges, persons 
whose character as censors should be above all 
suspicion, and advertize them to the world. 

Fourthly, — To announce publicly, and in 
good time, the rules or standards by which 
those judges are to estimate the merit of the 
different productions submitted. To do all 
this as it should be done, there must be some- 
thing like attention to the following details. 

With regard to the means by which the 
greatest number of competitors can be at- 
tracted, it must be obvious that one must be 
the number of prizes given in each class; and 
to do justice in this way there must be no 
frivolous distinction in classes. Let us, for ex- 
ample, take any one flower, say Roses, or 
Dahlias, or Carnations, or Picotees, or Pinks, 



or Ranunculuses — no matter which ; there 
ought not to be less than a dozen varieties 
exhibited by each ; and there should be cer- 
tainly not less than ten prizes. Most who 
excel, either from their mode of cultivation 
or the quantity they grow, may probably time 
after time take the first three or four prizes ; 
but there would then be six or seven more to 
be taken by the younger aspirants to horti- 
cultural honours, a great number of whom — 
who would never compete for the three or 
four, because there could be no chance for 
them — would gladly avail themselves of the 
opportunity of showing when there were ten ; 
and there would thus be ten successful exhi- 
bitors to exult in the prizes they had taken, 
instead of three or four, as is too often the case; 
besides which, the public would be gratified 
with many more stands of flowers : whereas, 
when there were but few prizes, and these all, 
as it were, bespoke, the numerous showers, 
who know they cannot successfully compete 
with the three or four best growers, would 
naturally, and in many places do abstain from 
showing altogether ; and the consequence is, 
that having no excitement, they do not culti- 
vate with half the enthusiasm. To make this 
feature still more complete, there should be a 
very gradual descent from one prize to 
another — say a tenth part difference. If the 
first prize be five pounds, the second ought 
to be ten shillings less, and the third ten 
shillings less than the second, the fourth ten 
shillings less than the third, and so on to the 
last, which would only be ten shillings. If 
the first prize were one pound, the second 
should be eighteen shillings, the third sixteen, 
the fourth fourteen, and so on ; the smallest 
being two shillings. The great advantage of 
this mode of dividing money given for prizes 
is, that there cannot be so much injustice done 
when the merits of flowers, on summing, are 
very nearly balanced ; for every body who has 
been a strict observer of exhibitions will ad- 
mit, that it is often very difficult to decide 
which is the better of two stands, and that it 
is a grievous disappointment to a shower when 
he sees that even a single point throws him out 
of all the benefit, and makes the difference 
between his winning twenty, or ten, or five 
pounds, and winning nothing. We can say 
conscientiously, that it has been a source of 
great vexation to us and other judges to be 
obliged to put flowers first when the second 
were all but as good; yet the difference between 
the first and second has been as ten pounds, 
and four or five pounds, and two; all of which 
vexation to judges, and mortification to ex- 
hibitors, would be avoided if it were only a 
difference of ten per cent. We cannot, then, 
too strongly insist upon the propriety, and for 
the sake of the science we might say, necessity, 



HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 



501 



of observing this rule most rigidly. We have 
to check ourselves frequently from mentioning 
the names of societies in which the evils we 
speak of are conspicuous ; but we set out with 
a determination, and must abide by it. We 
have before us now the schedule of one 
society, of which the committee of managers 
are nearly all showers, and the prizes have 
year after year been contrived so that all should 
have a turn ; rarely more than three, never 
more than four prizes for any one class ; and 
the classes are made on purpose that the com- 
mittee men shall not run in each other's way. 
It is even carried so far as to make distinct 
classes for amateurs and their gardeners, 
although it must be obvious to any man of 
common sense, that it cannot matter one 
farthing which shows from a collection, the 
master or the man ; but this was done that 
the man should show as well as his master : 
and so the amateur who kept no gardener at all, 
had not only to contend with a man who kept 
an experienced gardener, but he had also to 
show when there were only three prizes, all 
bespoke for the committee men by their 
superior advantages ; but his chances of win- 
ning at all were shut out, because, to increase 
the number of classes, each class was limited 
in number and amount of prizes. The end 
of all this is, that except the three or four 
who can win, few would attempt it ; and the 
winning flowers, in consequence of the want 
of competition, are frequently very discredit- 
able. We trust we have shown good reasons 
for adopting the system we advocate ; but. 
besides multiplying the classes in any one 
flower with regaVd to the persons who are to 
compete, there is another mischievous plan 
advocated and practised in many such societies, 
— the plan of multiplying the classes by 
awarding prizes to different numbers, as if to 
give the monopolizing managers opportunities 
of winning a plurality of prizes for the same 
subject. Thus we see prizes for the best 
thirty-six, the best twenty-four, the best 
twelve, and the best six — not more, perhaps, 
than two in each class ; and then it is a com- 
mon thing to see, Best thirty-six, Mr. A. B., 
second best, Mr. C. D. Best twenty-four, 
Mr. C. D., second best, Mr. A. B. Best 
twelve, Mr. A. B., second, Mr. C. D. Best 
six, Mr. C. D., second best, Mr. A. B. This 
is by no means rare, and if all the schemers 
in England had laid their heads together to 
destroy confidence, nothing more calculated 
to effect the purpose could have been con- 
trived. 

Again, there is another system equally 
worthy of the schemers who originate it. The 
members of the committee are individually 
famous for something ; each has some fancy, 
which, as he thinks, will do to give a prize 



for, and nobody else grows, or at least cannot 
be so strong in as he is ; and, accordingly, it 
gets placed on the schedule for a prize. If, 
however, any other of these disinterested 
managers is upon the same fancy, a second 
prize is offered ; and as it is doubtful which 
may be first, and which second, the value of 
those prizes is generally not very different. 
If anybody can do balsams or cockscombs 
well, prizes are given for them ; if not, we 
hear nothing of them, and so with any other 
subject. One man has provided himself with 
a collection of gooseberries, — a prize must be 
given for the best collection . One has a first- 
rate standard pear tree of a given variety, — 
such pears must not be forgotten. We could 
go through the whole business of one of the 
meetings held for schedule making, and give 
such instances of selfishness, such utter con- 
tempt for the true interests of horticulture, as 
would make the public disgusted with the 
things they are supporting ; and we maintain, 
that were it not for the several societies in 
which all members are equal, all pay subscrip- 
tions, and all depend on their own funds alone 
for their prizes, horticulture would have been 
destroyed as a science, by the meanness and 
duplicity of the people who unfortunately 
have succeeded in worming themselves into 
the management of Horticultural Societies. 
That there are exceptions to this worst of 
all descriptions of establishments, we are free 
to confess, but they are by no means plentiful, 
and perhaps all are more or less tainted with 
mismanagement. 

The choice of subjects for which prizes are 
to be given, should be made with a view to 
the creation of a fine exhibition ; and the less 
subjects are confined the better — or rather, 
the less prizes are confined to particular sub- 
jects the better. In plants, it may be unfair 
to make those who cultivate greenhouse 
plants only, exhibit in common with those 
who grow stove and greenhouse plants too ; 
but when we consider that a grand display is 
of the first importance at a public exhibition, 
the circumstances of the locality must guide 
us a little. If there are but few plant 
growers, and we want all we can get, it will 
be a fair question, whether it is better to give 
ten prizes for the best twenty, for plants of 
any kind, and so have all the advantage of the 
fine collections of stove-plants, or to give two 
series of prizes of half the amount for two 
different classes, — stove in one, and green- 
house in the other. We have seen with the 
greatest advantage the prizes given for the 
best twenty-four plants of any kind. So far 
as the public is concerned, the show in some 
places would be the better — for instance, when 
there are only two or three who can show 
stove plants at all : but when there is an 



502 



HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 



abundance of growers and plants too, separate 
classes may do better. But to give, as we 
have seen many do, separate series of prizes 
for very many different subjects, without any 
regard to whether they are objects of interest, 
or deserve particular encouragement, or contri- 
bute much or little towards the show, is really 
quite ridiculous, and exceedingly vexing to 
all true friends of gardening. We have, 
among other preposterous schedules now 
before us, one which gives a first and second 
prize only to each of the following : — -Balsams, 
Cockscombs, Hydrangeas, Heaths, Roses, 
Annuals, Stove plants, Orchideous plants, 
Pansies, Dahlias, Cinerarias, Petunias, Apples, 
Pears, Gooseberries, Currants, Melons, Pine 
Apples, Grapes in ■■ doors, Grapes out- 
doors, Pigs, Peaches, Nectarines, Raspberries, 
Lettuce, Cabbages, Potatoes, Peas, Beans, 
Carrots, Turnips, Beetroot, and thirty other 
articles ; and the show was not worth going 
to. Plates of fruit that would be almost 
thrown away in some places, and would 
hardly be tolerated at a stall in London, 
covered the tables, — four-fifths of them out of 
one garden ; and the award of the prizes was 
as might be expected from such a schedule. 
Mr. A. B. C. of D. was almost the only 
name that appeared, and he made a regular 
sweep of prizes, because there were none to 
compete with him, from the fact, that for 
two or three years the prizes had all been so 
parcelled out as to make him the recipient of 
a vast majority. Had there been a series of 
ten prizes for the best collections of fruit — not 
less than five or six or any given number of 
varieties, so that he could have taken only the 
first — there had been twenty competitors for 
the others, and a better show of fruit : but 
to give all these prizes where there was but 
one first-rate establishment in the neighbour- 
hood, was to throw every prize into the 
owner's lap; and rather than miss any thing, 
raspberries long gone by their prime, goose- 
berries dead ripe and out of all colour, and 
a dozen other things perfectly unfit for table, 
were brought, as if the judges were bound to 
give prizes for rubbish : the fault was in the 
.schedule. But it is time all this nonsense were 
done with. We see it more or less in most 
schedules, and hope to see an alteration in 
very many respects. 

It is a pity that any exhibitor should have 
a voice in the management, unless he can 
look to the advantage of the science of hor- 
ticulture, instead of himself; for, unless this 
be done, the best supported society will 
dwindle into a little community of selfish 
grasping sharpers, eager to seize upon any 
thing that is to be had, and careless how the 
thing be accomplished; and the public will lose 
all interest in time. By far the most valu- 



able supporters of the science — those who 
aspire to win prizes for the honour of them — 
Avill be shaken off, and all honourable rivalry 
will cease. It is requisite that those who have 
been acting as we have described — and we 
know whole committees who have — should 
begin to think it time to desist ; and first 
making out an honest and judicious schedule, 
they should find honourable men for judges, 
publish the laws by which things are to be 
judged, and if it be only to prevent exposure, 
give every cultivator a fair field. 

RULES FOR JUDGING. 

The necessity of publishing a resolution 
or regulation, as to what standards are to be 
used forjudging the productions exhibited at 
public shows, ought long since to have been 
manifest to the committees or managers, and 
yet more than half the schedules of prizes are 
issued without the slightest intimation ; so 
that the adoption of proper standards only 
does half the good that might be done if the 
proper notice were given. Exhibitors do not 
know what they are about, because they know 
there is but little dependence on taste ; and 
in consequence, some speculate on large 
flowers, some on perfect flowers without 
reference to size, some upon colour, and some 
on novelty, without considering any other 
point. Now those societies which have re- 
solved on judging by the standard laid down 
by Mr. Glenny* (and a vast majority have so 
done), and instruct their judges to that effect, 
have only half done their work unless they 
communicate that fact in their schedules. We 
know, indeed, that even where the committees 
have come to no decision on the subject, they 
nevertheless calculate on judges adopting them; 
for, indeed, the advance of florists' flowers in 
particular has been so great under the new 
standard, that they have already surpassed 
what our predecessors called the criterion, and 
have left the assumed perfections far in the 
rear. This was the natural consequence of 
setting up a standard which could not be 
reached; and if the Floral Societies would at 
once avow that they will have the productions 
judged by that standard, every exhibitor would 
become a judge, and almost know his fate by a 
glance round the stands; each would know 
exactly what he had to strive for, and his 
study would simply be to produce his flowers 
as nearly like it as possible. 

ADVERTIZING THE INTENDED SHOWS. 

Some of those Horticultural Societies which 
apparently depend on their own resources 
only, are too apt to neglect giving publicity 
to their intended meetings, from a mistaken 



Glenny's " Properties of Flowers and Plants." 



HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 



503 



notion that they concern nobody but their 
own members, and that they can inform all 
those by letter, and therefore that any further 
publicity that would cost money would be 
a waste of the funds. Perhaps this is the 
strongest possible case that we .could select 
to justify the neglect or refusal to advertize. 
Let us consider whether even such a society 
as this is to be exempt from the charge of 
limiting the good they do by their parsi- 
monious and inconsiderate privacy. The pro- 
fessed object of all such societies is to promote 
the science, to engage men's leisure time in 
rational employment, to stir up their honest 
pride, and excite emulation ; and by example 
as well as precept to stimulate them to exer- 
tion in a quiet and delightful study which 
weans the mind from less healthful indulgences 
of the outer world. Now those who defend 
the propriety of doing all this in private, con- 
tent themselves with carrying out only one 
half their avowed objects, and only do a small 
portion of the good they might do by a little 
more expenditure. If it be good to en- 
courage these societies at all, the more socie- 
ties there are, the better it must be ; for it is 
quite certain, that if it improve the morals of 
the working and even middle classes to ensrase 

... o o 

their attention in the delightful pursuit of 
horticulture in one village, it must have the 
same tendency in another; and no one will 
dispute, that where Horticultural Societies 
are established it has a manifest and highly 
beneficial tendency. The people then of a 
village in the Isle of Man, of the colony of 
New Zealand, or at Hong Kong, may es- 
tablish a society and " do good by stealth," 
believing all the while that their business 
concerns nobody but themselves or their 
own members ; but they forget the force 
of example, — they do not consider how 
many localities would be stirred up to do 
the same, for very shame that with greater 
advantages about them they are doing no- 
thing. The fact ' of reading in a newspaper 
that in a certain remote place where they 
have to surmount all sorts of difficulties they 
have got up a Horticultural Society, may in- 
duce many who neglect so prolific a source of 
good to rouse their neighbours to " do like- 
wise ;" hence it is that we conclude that 
societies do only half the good they might do 
when they neglect to show the public what 
they are doing. It is not enough to do good 
anonymously; it is not enough to be virtuous 
in private. Nobody will dispute that the prin- 
cipal esquire in a village and all his family 
might pray at home, and practise all the vir- 
tues in secret, and that they might be in all 
respects unexceptionable ; but, will any body 
tell us that they will do one half the good that 
they would accomplish if they attended public 



worship, and set a good example to the rest; 
or that their private charity would do half 
the service that would be done by their head- 
ing a list of charitable neighbours, and by 
their open proceedings stimulating others to 
similar acts ? The thing is out of the ques- 
tion. We hate ostentation, but we also dis- 
approve of hiding a light under a bushel. Man 
is an imitative animal ; and the more good 
examples there are placed before him, the 
more likely he is to follow some, much to his 
own benefit and to the advantage of his neigh- 
bours. Nor do we care what motive first 
causes a man to follow a good example ; it 
may be pride, it may be envy, but by doing 
good actions frequently it may become habi- 
tual; and the very act which originated in 
pride or envy may be continued with a full 
sense of its importance. In Horticultural 
Societies the proceedings are fraught with 
good : the loose idler is led to healthful recre- 
ation ; the drunkard is insensibly led to an 
amusing occupation, and eveiybody engaged 
is improved in the knowledge and practice of 
gardening. That village, then, which has not 
its Horticultural Society, or which is not in 
connexion with such, loses a great means of 
improving the morals and habits of the inhabi- 
tants. Whatever can induce the wealthy classes 
to institute such means, does enormous good 
for society at large; and nobody need be told 
that nothing stimulates men so much as the 
knowledge that people less powerful, less in- 
fluential, are doing something that they, the 
more powerful and more influential, have not 
done. This fact alone has been frequently the 
cause of many a good institution, benevolent 
as well as scientific. The wounded pride of 
a man who hears another admired for some 
good action, will do much to stimulate even a 
bad man to outdo the good one in amount or 
in exertion. Upon these grounds we main- 
tain, that the very first duty of individuals 
and of societies whose example may be pro- 
fitably followed, is to place that example 
before the public in its best and most alluring 
form. 

Every Horticultural Society ought to con- 
sider, that, however much good they may do 
at home, they should publish their doings for 
the benefit of those in more neglected places. 
If there be but one active man in a particular 
locality, desirous of establishing a society, that 
mau's work is more than half done if he can 
point out to his neighbours that some less 
considerable place has one; so that if the 
managers of the most isolated society in the

ease as this, how much more desirable it is 
where there is a chance of inducing some dis- 
tant friend to pay a visit, or of opening a 
correspondence with horticulturalists afar off ! 
It need hardly be mentioned here, that the 
publicity given to the proceedings of Horti- 
cultural Societies leads to the purchase of 



new flowers, the introduction of novelties 
from a distance, and the general advancement 
of all the interests connected with gardening 
We ought not to have more to urge to con- 
vince the managers of societies, however 
isolated, that their first duty is to advertize 
and make public their proceedings. 




THE CAMELLIA AS A WALL PLANT. 



Though often'seen, and deservedly esteemed, 
both as a pot plant and planted out in the con- 
servatory, the Camellia is by no means fre- 
quently met with planted in favourable 
situations against the open walls ; and yet in 
such situations, with a proper course of pre- 
paration, and very slight protection, they 
may be had in a tolerable state of perfection in 
the latitude of London. We shall proceed to 
treat of them in this view, under the heads 
of aspect, soil, and protection. 

Aspect. — In selecting a situation for these 
plants, persons unacquainted with their habits 
would be liable, inconsiderately, to commit an 
important error. For all tender plants it 
seems natural, and very generally is proper, 
to select the warmest aspect, as the best 
suited to their outdoor cultivation : this 
warmest aspect is of course that facing the 
south. Now there are two main reasons 
why this would not be a fitting aspect for a 



Camellia ; first, it blooms early ; and secondly, 
it makes its growth early ; and under the 
excitement given to the plant by the warmth 
and shelter it would enjoy in a southern 
aspect, these precocious habits would be cer- 
tainly not held back, probably in some degree 
encouraged. The consequence of this would 
be, that both bloom and young shoots would 
suffer from cold, or else, as an alternative, 
their beauty must be too much hidden from 
view by the covering afforded to them as a 
necessary protection against cold. This in- 
convenience is to be avoided by selecting 
for the out- door Camellias the coldest and 
most backward aspect, that is, the northern ; 
here the vegetative powers of the plant, re- 
ceiving no undue stimulus, remain dormant 
until a later period of the spring, when there 
is little damage to be apprehended from cold 
either to the blossoms or shoots ; for though 
they may then flower and grow, before it

would be safe to expose entirely, plants of 
their degree of hardiness to our common spring 
climate, yet the protection afforded by close 
contact with the wall will be then sufficient 
to preserve them. 

Soil. — Whenever tender exotics, no matter 
what their degree of tenderness may be, are 
submitted to a course of treatment by which 
they are supposed to acquire a greater degree 
of hardiness than is usually attributed to 
them, the manner in which the soil is pre- 
pared for their roots is of the first degree of 
importance. The proper mode of preparation 
is thus : — In the first place, if against a wall 
or building, see that there is no drip falls 
near enough to render the soil wet, nor any 
leakage from drains or other sources that 
would produce a like effect. Then take out 
the original soil from a space three feet wide 
and a foot in depth at the front, and six 
inches next the wall, so as to have the bottom 
sloping outwai'ds. On this ram down firmly 
an even layer of six inches of concrete, 
formed of lime and coarse gritty sand, or of 
clay. In the front, of course, there must be 
egress for the water which this concrete 
intercepts in its downward passage. On the 
concrete lay six inches of roughish brick 
rubble, broken into lumps as large as eggs, or 
larger ; this will bring up the front to the 
original level, and the back six inches higher ; 
next place a layer of one thickness of turf 
all over, and on this six inches of rough turfy 
loam and peat, three parts of the former to 
one of the latter ; then one foot of good com- 
post, made of three parts turfy loam, one part 
peat, and enough rough gritty sand, added 
to make the whole porous. The soil will 
thus form a sloping border, about a foot 
and a half higher than the ordinary level at 
the front edge, compounded as follows : — 
six inches of concrete ; six inches of rubble ; 
a layer of turf ; six inches of rough soil ; 
twelve inches of compost. All the ingredients 
of the soil should be in a good workable con- 
dition, neither wet nor dry, but in a medium 
state of moistness. 

Protection. — This necessarily includes two 
considerations, — the preservation of the roots, 
and the preservation of the branches ; the 
former is most important in the autumn, and 
thence onward through the winter ; the latter 
from the commencement of severe frosts, as 
long as they continue. 

A very good and cheap material for pro- 
tecting the roots is dry sawdust, spread over 
the soil to the depth of six inches, and rather 
more about the base of the plants ; this should 
be put on before the soil gets soaked with 
rain in the autumn. The same thickness of 
tree leaves would also form an efficient pro- 
tection ; or if neither of these are convenient, 



almost any other material will do, such as 
dry litter, or fern, or old tan, or coal ashes. 
Another material, easily obtainable in the 
country, very efficient, and available for com- 
posts when required no longer for this pur- 
pose, are thin turves of green-sward, about a 
foot or rather more in diameter, cut and dried 
in summer, and when used laid over a thin 
layer of leaves or litter, in the manner of 
roofing tiles, beginning at the outer edge. 

For the tops, various means of protection 
may also be made use of. In these days of 
cheap glass, those who choose to excel in 
these matters might have glass sashes made to 
lean against the wall, to be placed there per- 
manently for the winter season. In extremely 
severe weather, a mat or so in addition would 
afford protection enough. What would be 
equally efficient would be a frame work 
thatched with straw or fern, and set before 
the plants ; but as this would exclude light, 
it would be desirable to remove it during 
the day in all fine dry weather, replacing it 
again at night. In any case these covers 
will be all the more efficient if large enough 
to stand over the principal part of the border 
as well as the plants. Where neither of these 
plans can he adopted, mats may be nailed 
over the plants — a single mat in thickness in 
ordinary frosts, and two mats in more severe 
weather ; they should be so contrived as to 
admit of being opened and turned back off 
the plants during fine weather. 

The few other particulars of treatment 
required need not be enlarged on. They con- 
sist of such operations as the proper training 
and thinning where necessary of the branches ; 
early thinning of the flower buds where they 
grow in clusters ; watex'ing in very dry 
weather during the earlier part of summer ; 
and such like routine matters. 

We may be asked, why recommend the 
growth of Camellias under such circum- 
stances as these, when they can be had in 
greater perfection in other departments of the 
garden ? In the first place, many may grow 
them this way who cannot, because they have 
not the means, grow them in any other. In 
the second place, those whose means enable 
them to grow them to greater perfection in 
their greenhouses, may thus have their sea- 
son of blooming extended, and so secure a 
greater variety among their out-door plants. 
There is, in fact, no good reason why those who 
choose to grow Camellias in situations such as 
that which has been described, should not do 
so if they please. We have seen sneers at the 
mention of Camellias as shrubs in the open 
borders, because " they are so inferior to the 
plants in-doors ;" but we have also seen very 
interesting plants thus grown within the 
county of Surrey, and these plants have pro-

duced their flowers with tolerable freedom for 
many years in succession. There is a great 
deal of interest attending even a very mode- 
rate degree of success in the culture of such 
plants as these in the open air. 




POLEMONIUM REPTANS. 

(Li/mceu-s.) 
THE CREEPING POLEHOXIUM. 

The plant which is here indicated is a her- 
baceous perennial, of small stature, seldom 
reaching so much as a foot high, producing 
from the roots numerous elegantly pinnated 
leaves and flower stems, bearing at the top a 
small panicle of blue flowers, formed of five 
somewhat ovate petals ; the flowers are pro- 
duced in July and August. The plant is a 
native of the northern parts of America, and 
is perfectly hardy in this country. It belongs 
to Polemoniaceae, the same natural order which 
contains the Phloxes. 

As an ornamental perennial, this plant is 
well worthy of a place in the flower-garden, 
where it is of course, from its dwarfness, 
most properly kept near the front. It may 
also be introduced on rock work, when that 
position is not entirely devoted to the more 
minute Alpine plants. In either position it 
is of the easiest culture, requiring only to be 
planted in the ordinary soil, and watered in 
very dry weather. It may be propagated 
with facility by parting the roots ; or more 
extensively by its seeds, which are usually 
produced freely, and from which strong plants 
for blooming one season may be raised, by 
sowing about June in the preceding year, and 
transplanting in the autumn. It is one of 
those plants that does not vary much, if at all, 
when raised from seeds. 

Those who have shrubbery borders of any 
extent, would find it conduce much to their 
enlivenment during the summer season, when 
the walks leading through shrubberies are 



sought for the purpose of promenade, to sow 
a considerable number of the easier growing 
and easily obtained perennial plants, of hand- 
some appearance, for the purpose of planting 
them in groups and patches near the walks, 
in those parts where room could be found for 
them in front of or between the forwardest 
shrubs. For this purpose the Polemonium 
reptans, as well as P. cceruleum and P. 
sibiricum, would be well adapted. 

IMPROVEMENT OF SMALL FRUITS.* 

The improvement of the various kinds of 
small fruits which are cultivated in gardens, 
and the due adaptation of them to the various 
purposes for which they are held in requisition, 
is a matter deserving attention. There are 
scarcely any of our smaller garden fruits that 
might not be very greatly altered and improved 
in many ways ; and yet it is seldom that any 
attempt is made to improve them : they seem 
to be almost universally regarded as beneath 
consideration in this respect. That such 
kinds as those alluded to, do, however, possess 
importance, whether regarded as dessert or 
culinary fruit, may easily be seen. Suppose, 
for instance, that strawberries, and raspberries, 
and gooseberries, and currants, were inter- 
dicted, would not their loss be felt ? And 
what would supply their places ? Just in 
proportion as the loss of them Avould be felt, 
must their importance be estimated ; and, judg- 
ing of them by this rule, it would assuredly 
be very considerable. None of the fruits 
already alluded to for the sake of illustration, 
present us with the highest excellence of 
which they are capable, or afford us the variety 
they are adapted to supply. The field of 
experiment is boundless, in this direction. 
We have, it is true, of most of the fruits 
alluded to, varieties which are remarkable for 
various good qualities, such, for example, as 
precocity, lateness, size, high flavour, &c. ; 
but there are few varieties in which as many 
of these good qualities as might be, are com- 
bined. It is notorious that early varieties are 
often tolerated on no other ground than that 
of precocity. Varieties possessing size in any 
remarkable degree, are almost as notorious for 
the absence of the higher qualities of flavour. 
And late varieties, if they do more generally 
possess higher flavour than early ones, are 
often equally with the latter deficient in size. 
Now when it is remembered that such con- 
siderations as these are applicable more or less 
to every kind of small fruit which we culti- 
vate, it will appear that there is very much 
which might be done, many steps which might 
be taken, to effect this work of improvement.

And if the goal is distant, and the length of 
the journey should affright any from the road, 
it should be remembered that vantage ground 
is gained at every step. Not only does every 
advance constitute an improvement in itself, 
but increased facilities for further advances 
are at the same time secured. 

What might be done for the strawberry ? 
Almost all our present varieties fruit early in 
the summer, and are comparatively soon gone 
by ; this is to some extent remedied by the 
skill of cultivators in providing succession 
crops, but why should not later varieties be 
originated which would produce their fruit 
so that naturally a longer succession might 
be realized ? Good late strawberries would be 
especially valuable. Something has already 
been done in this way. Not very long ago 
there were exhibited some fruit of a variety 
raised at Bicton, and named the Bicton Seed- 
ling — a useful late white fruit. "Why not from 
this and other late varieties now cultivated 
raise others later still, and so carry on the 
strawberry season throughout the summer ? 
These fruits if of good quality would be no 
more rejected in August or September, than 
in June or July. And if such things are 
thought lightly of now, it is only because the 
later varieties we possess are poor in quality 
compared with others. Here another avenue 
is opened. If their quality is indifferent, im- 
prove it : cross-breed with varieties of high 
flavour, and that flavour will sooner or later 
be secured in the late fruiting varieties. Objec- 
tions might be raised even to this. How, it 
may be inquired, can those varieties, possess- 
ing high flavour, whose season is past, be 
obtained to hybridize the varieties which are 
naturally late ? The importance of the result 
must here supply an inducement to resort to 
artificial means. Some of those kinds possess- 
ing the quality of high flavour must be treated 
so as to cause them to flower late — as late 
indeed as may be necessary, and thus the 
means of hybridizing must be provided. In 
extending the strawberry season late into the 
summer, the Alpine varieties might be taken 
as the basis of a series of experiments ; but in 
this case there would be abundant opportunities 
for improvement both as regards size and 
quality. 

What can be done for the raspberry ? Per- 
haps less than in most other kinds of small 
fruit. It is not clear that the flavour of the 
raspberry could be at all improved. There is 
probably not much to be gained in the way of 
imparting to it variety of appearance. The 
best varieties at least possess the property of 
size, in a considerable degree ; and though 
this might be enlarged upon, yet it does not 
seem to strike one as a very necessary change ; 
some of the present varieties, when well 



grown, may indeed be considered large. There 
does, however, seem to be one point at least 
on which an improvement might be wrought. 
Notwithstanding that the fruit is held in such 
universal estimation, the raspberry season is 
but of short duration. True, there is a double- 
bearing variety, as it is called, which fruits 
later than the other kinds ; this is valuable, so 
far, in itself, but we also take it as the earn- 
est of something further. It is, in fact, just 
the thing to work with ; and we have no doubt 
that a little well-directed energy would very 
shortly produce from it varieties which would 
materially prolong the raspberry season. 

What can be done for the gooseberry ? 
That the gooseberry cannot resist the power 
of improvement to which we are referring, 
there is ample evidence in the production of 
the prize varieties, for which Lancashire is 
famous. But the Lancashire growers breed 
only for size ; that quality they have indeed 
stamped upon the fruit in a very remarkable 
degree, but this of itself is not enough for the 
dessert, nor yet for the culinary department ; 
quality, not less than quantity, is a necessary 
recommendation in the garden of the con- 
noisseur. Gooseberry growers may, therefore, 
busy themselves to impart the flavour of the 
choicer kinds to the large show varieties that 
are now chiefly raised ; and, in doing this, 
they will have effected an improvement worthy 
of the effort. But why not also prolong the 
gooseberry season ? It is fully short enough. 
Some of the early kinds might, in time, be 
pushed a little nearer the vernal equinox than 
we now have them ; and this early race would 
not be injured by increased size, and more 
concentrated flavour. Then, again, with the 
late varieties. Might not new forms, later 
than any we now possess, be obtained ? and 
would not, in this case also, additional size 
constitute a further improvement ? These 
results are only waiting the well-directed 
efforts of some zealous individual to meet a 
full realization. 

What can be done for the currant ? We 
see no reason why bunches of currants should 
not, for size, bear a closer comparison than 
now, with bunches of grapes. The thing is 
by no means so ideal as it might at first seem 
to be. Were the berries double the size of 
those of the largest of our present varieties, 
and these, borne as we now see them, occa- 
sionally, from a dozen to a dozen and a half in 
a bunch, we should have a very respectable 
approach, if not to the clusters of Eshcol, at 
least to the more ordinary range of our culti- 
vated grapes. Some of the varieties bear fruit 
which is less acid, and less woody-tasted, than 
that of others : these qualities would, of course, 
be required in the new and improved series. 
Then, again, currants are a fruit which it is 



508 



IMPROVEMENT 03? SMALL FRUITS. 



often considered desirable to keep for some 
time — some months indeed — on the trees. It 
would be worth attempting to obtain varieties 
which would hang better than our present 
varieties do. On the subject of improving the 
present varieties of currants, some judicious 
remarks by Mr. Tomlinson, in the Midland 
Florist, directly bear : — 

" I have for years been an extensive culti 
vator of currants, selling the produce in the 
large town in my immediate neighbourhood, 
and I find, that though the red grape is a large 
and fleshy fruit, still it ripens unkindly, which 
is a great drawback to its more extended cul- 
tivation. The old long-bunched red is, with 
me, far preferable ; but I see no earthly reason 
why this fruit might not be improved in a 
very great degree. Would it not be possible 
to raise a ' currant show,' on the principle of 
the Lancashire gooseberry shows ? and if this 
could be carried out, and an inducement given 
to raise fresh varieties from seed, I make no 
doubt that we should speedily have currants 
double the present size, and much longer in 
the bunch ; and I am sure that nothing would 
pay better than improved varieties of both 
black and white, as well as red ones. The 
plant comes early into bearing, and any im- 
provement on the old sorts would speedily 
supersede them, as the black Naples is now 
displacing the black grape. I heard of several 
new sorts, which I purchased last autumn, and 
am now growing them, to test their respective 
qualities. Of course I cannot, the first season, 
decide, as I should wish to have my plants well 
established. The sorts purchased are : — 

" 1. The Gondouin Red. — A continental 
variety, with peculiarly red wood and large 
foliage, very distinct in habit. 

" 2. The Cherry Med. — Also from the con- 
tinent. This has extremely large foliage, and 
stout shoots. 

" 3. May's Victoria. — This, I see, has been 
mentioned in several publications as a large 
and very prolific variety, and would, doubtless, 
be a fine sort to save seed from. 

"4. Haughton Castle (Red). — This was 
raised in the far north of England. Its cha- 
racter to me was large and late. It appears 
to be an erect grower, and has abundance of 
fruit, which is of good flavour, though, from 
the circumstance of the trees being planted 
only last autumn, not so large as when they 
become established. 

" 5. Goliath. — I have also received with 
this a first-rate character as a good red cur- 
rant ; and if any induction is to be made from 
its luxuriant mode of growth, I should fancy 
it would respond to its name. 

' ; I have selected some of the largest berries 
on both Goliath and May's Victoria, the seeds 
of which I intend to sow ; and should these 



prove large, I will again sow from the largest. 
By this means, in a series of years, I hope to 
arrive at the height of my ambition, namely, 
to produce currants as large as small marbles. 
Now I am confident there is nothing Utopian 
in all this ; and I am certain that if a few 
persevering individuals were to devote their 
attention to the improvement of the currant, 
it would be attained in less than ten years." 

In these and many other ways might even 
the best of our present varieties be improved ; 
and we know of nothing which might be 
attempted with less effort and a greater pros- 
pect of success. If gardeners would turn 
their attention to the matter, we should soon 
have to witness the results. Many persons 
are deterred from experiments of this kind, 
under the impression that it is a work of 
magnitude. This is to a great extent erro- 
neous. The idea has indeed gone forth, and 
seems to be widely dispersed, that the per- 
centage of improvement among seedling plants 
is infinitesimally small, and that a very large 
number must be grown to offer even a remote 
chance of success ; but this idea, doubtless, 
owes its origin to the too common practice of 
saving seeds promiscuously, without regard to 
impregnation. From such a progeny little 
indeed may be expected : it is a waste of time 
and labour to act thus, with the view of 
originating improved varieties of any kind of 
plant ; and one carefully fertilized seed is 
worth a hundred so obtained. If, however, 
the thing be attempted on principle it becomes 
an easy task, and not only is the labour light- 
ened, but the chances of a satisfactory result 
are at the same time greatly increased. Sup- 
pose one hundred gardeners were each to fer- 
tilize one strawberry blossom, according to 
their own ideas of what blending of varieties 
would constitute an improvement ; the trouble 
of doing so would be so trifling as not to be 
worthy of mention, while it is probable that 
even the first results would be important. But 
in these matters we must not be satisfied with 
first results ; a second or third cross of the 
hybrid with the male parent (if the latter 
were well chosen) would most likely — as it has 
done before — result in considerable farther 
improvement. 

The practice under consideration may, how- 
ever, be perverted. The perversion we refer 
to, is that of naming and distributing seedling 
fruits that in reality do not possess any pro- 
perty superior to those of older and well 
known kinds. This must always be depre- 
cated. If those who raise seedling fruits, do 
not really know their worth, they should sub- 
mit them to some competent judge. The 
probability of varieties, perhaps good in them- 
selves, but not better than older and well 
known kinds, being passed off as possessing 



BOTANICAL TEEMS. 



509 



superior properties, is so great, that every 
raiser of seedling fruits would do well to set 
his face so far against the practice, as to 
chance to err slightly on the other side, rather 
than uselessly encumber the fruit lists with 
the names of varieties which, at the highest 
estimate that can be put on them, are no better 
than we already possess. In cases where 
varieties are obtained that really do possess 
superior, though very slightly improved pro- 
perties, it would be better to retain such 
varieties as breeders, than to propagate and 
distribute them for general cultivation. The 
possessor of such improved varieties would 
have a direct advantage over others not so 
circumstanced, as regards the additional im- 
provement to be looked for in the succeeding 
races ; and we contend, that it would be better 
for all parties if this course were followed, and 
the horticultural world not troubled with the 
results until something really good and dis- 
tinct were obtained. 

Experiments of this kind are the better for 
being conducted on a limited scale. One case 
of cross-breeding, carefully wrought out, on 
correct principles, is more pregnant with 
really useful and valuable results, than a 
thousand promiscuous ones, or a hundred 
carelessly prosecuted ; while, of course, the 
labour and trouble attending the experiments 
become lessened a hundred, or a thousand-fold. 
Those, too, who have time and opportunity 
for more extensive operations, should take 
care to multiply carefully — instead of care- 
lessly — conducted experiments.

iESCHTNANTHUS PULCHRA. 

(De Oandolle.) 
THE BEAUTIFUL ^ESCHYNANTH. 

The annexed engraving represents one of 
the best of the new species of JEschynanthus, 
which have been introduced by Messrs. Veitch, 
nurserymen, of Exeter, through the agency 
of their collector, Mr. Thomas Lobb. The 
name it bears is most appropriate, for it is 
in truth a beautiful subject. In the damp 
forests of Java various species of -ZEschy- 
nanthus abound, growing on the branches 
and trunks of the trees, and assuming in the 
disposition of their branches a most gracefully 



AZALEA OVATA.

pendulous habit. This, added to the pro- 
fusion and rich colouring of their blossoms, 
renders them exceedingly beautiful; and among 
stove plants — for they of course require stove 
culture — they take the very first rank. 

The present species has naturally this epi- 
phytal pendulous character, though in mairy 
cases it may be inconvenient to adopt it 
under artificial cultivation, especially where 
the plants are required to be often moved. 
As it grows, a number of slender branches of 
moderate length are produced, and these are 
furnished with firm fleshy opposite broadly 
ovate leaves, of a deep green colour. On 
these branches, and the numerous side shoots 
that are produced, the corymbs of flowers are 
borne at the end ; the flowers are large, 
tubular, curved, divided at the end into five 
segments, of a rich, deep scarlet colour, marked 
at the mouth of the tube with yellow streaks. 
The plants appear to produce these blossoms 
freely through the whole of the summer. 

The annexed wood-cut scarcely conveys an 
idea of the rich appearance of the plant ; the 
blooms are large, not less than two inches long. 
As already hinted, this species was sent to 
England from Java by Mr. Lobb, and was 
first flowered and publicly exhibited in the 
summer of 1846, by Messrs. Veitch, of Exeter. 
Where it is convenient to attach the plant 
to a large block of wood, such as the stump of 
a tree, it would be desirable to allow it to 
assume its own natural style of growth ; and 
even when grown in pots, for convenience of 
removal, and necessarily more or less sup- 
ported by stakes, as much freedom of growth 
as would be consistent with an orderly appear- 
ance ought to be allowed it. When potted, a 
light turfy soil is most proper for it ; a mix- 
ture of turfy peat with a small proportion of 
turfy loam and some decayed wood, would 
form a very suitable material for its roots ; 
and when grown upon blocks, a portion of 
moss should be kept about those parts where 
the roots are forming, and this moss must be 
frequently damped. Where the latter mode 
of growth is adopted, it is better to begin with 
a plant of moderate size in preference to one 
of considerable size. During the period of 
their active growth, say from March to June, 
they require a hot damp stove, such as is 
usually provided for orchidaceous plants. 
After that time, at least as the blooms become 
nearly ready to open, they may be removed to 
a cooler and drier atmosphere, such as that of a 
warm greenhouse ; the change, however, must 
be brought about gradually, or probably the 
blooms would be sacrificed. After blooming, 
and during the winter, they may be kept in a 
dry cool stove. There is no difficulty in 
propagating it from cuttings planted in the 
ordinary way. 



AZALEA OVATA. 
(Lindley.) 
THE OVATE-LEAVED AZALEA. 

This is one of the plants introduced a year 
or two since to our gardens, from China, by 
Mr. Fortune, the botanical collector of the 
Horticultural Society. It is a shrub perfectly 
hardy, and of great beauty, and as such will 
be regarded as a welcome ornament to our 
shrubberies and " American" borders. It is, 
moreover, very distinct in its appearance from 
any of the Azaleas cultivated in our gardens. 




The leaves of this plant, which are of an 
ovate form, in some cases almost heart-shaped, 
are small, very dark green, and shining. The 
flowers are produced in clusters at the ends of 
the branches, growing singly in the axils of 
the upper leaves ; they are somewhat roundish 
in outline, and resembling in structure those of 
Rhododendron dailricum, and R. cham.ce- 
cistus, that is, without the long funnel-shaped 
base which is conspicuous in the flowers of 
most of this group of plants ; this form will 
be clearly understood from the engraving. 
There are two varieties known, in one of 
which the blossoms are pure white, in the 
other tinged with delicate pink ; both are 
spotted with small dark coloured dots on the 
upper petals. 

In reference to this plant, Mr. Fortune 
observes : — " In the woods this species has an 
arborescent habit, and grows from eight to 
twelve feet in height, but on the exposed hill- 
sides it generally forms a dwarf bush two or 
three feet high. Its flowers are produced in 
the greatest profusion in the months of April 
and May. It was found growing on the sides 
of the green-tea hills in the province of 
Chekiang, and also in some of the islands of

THE SCILLA OR SQUILL. 



the Chusan Archipelago, where it is called 
Xing-sze-rvJia, or 'silver silk flower' by the 
northern Chinese. I never met with this 
species in the south of China, and it is probable 
that it -will be found hardy in the climate of 
England. It may be propagated easily enough 
by seeds, cuttings, or layers, or it may be 
grafted on some of the hardy species. Some 
of the hardy varieties of Rhododendron would 
probably make good stocks for this purpose. 
One of the chief points to be attended to in 
its cultivation, is thorough drainage. I in- 
variably found it growing on the hill- sides, 
often amongst rocks and stones where no 
stagnant water could remain near its roots. 
This point being attended to, it will be found 
to thrive well in the same kind of soil in 
which the other species of Azalea are generally 
grown." 

The hardiness of the plant has been well 
tested during the winter of 1846-7. In the 
garden of the Horticultural Society at Chis- 
wick it has been found to bear a temperature 
of four degrees Fahrenheit, in a low damp 
situation, both on a south and north aspect, 
without exhibiting any appearance of suffering. 





(Scilla bifolia.) 

THE SCILLA OR SQUILL. 

Among the small bulbous plants which 
flower in the months of spring, few possess 
more beauty than the different species and 
varieties of Scilla. Two or three of the kinds 
flower early enough to bear company with the 
blossoms of the crocus, and with these, and 
indeed every other kind of flower produced at 
that season of the year, their prevailing cceru- 
lean tint forms an admirable association and 
contrast. It is to these early flowering kinds 
that in this place we particularly direct atten- 
tion. Growing not more than three or four 
inche.9 high, and bearing for the most part 
blue flowers, they would form beautiful beds. 



or margins to beds in the flower-garden, where 
now such plants as snowdrops and crocuses are 
almost exclusively depended on for the earliest 
bloom. The snowdrop, as is well known, 
furnishes white blossoms only ; the crocus 
supplies yellow, orange, purple, and various 
particolours ; but neither in this is the pure 
blue colour to be found. Those persons, there- 
fore, who desire that their gardens should 
burst forth into beauty with the earliest dawn 
of returning spring, should on no account fail 
to procure and plant largely of the kinds of 
squill we are now about to notice. 

Scilla bifolia, of which there are some 
distinct varieties, is represented in the accom- 
panying engraving. It has a small oblong- 
bulb, from which proceed usually two, but 
sometimes three, dark green, shining, linear, 
lance-shaped leaves of about three inches in 
length ; from between these arises the erect 
scape of flowers, reaching about an equal 
height, bearing a few — six or eight — blue 
flowers, which are small, star-like, composed 
of six ovate-lanceolate concave spreading seg- 
ments. These flowers are produced during 
March and April, often early in the former 
month. There is a variety with white 
blossoms called S. bifolia alba, and another 
with pink flowers called S. bifolia rubra. 
This species is said to have been found wild 
in England, but this is rather doubtful. 

Scilla verna has small roundish bulbs, from 
which grow several dark green shining linear 
leaves, about four inches in length, from be- 
tween which arises the erect scape to about 
the same height, bearing a roundish head of 
star-like deep purplish blue flowers ; these 
appear in April and May. This is a native 
of the sea-coast of the sister kingdoms, in some 
places covering large tracts of ground. 

Scilla sibirica has roundish bulbs, and 
two or three broadly lanceolate linear shining 
leaves of a bright green colour, growing about 
three inches high ; the flowers, of which two 
or three are borne on a nodding scape, are 
larger than in S. bifolia, and drooping ; they 
are of a most beautiful light clear blue tint, 
and being a vigorous growing though small 
plant, they are very freely produced, and con- 
tinue some time in blossom. They are pro- 
duced early in March and continue throughout 
the month, a few blooms continuing some- 
times to be produced even in April. It is of 
course a native of Siberia. 

Scilla amama is rather a smaller growing 
plant than the last ; it has roundish bulbs, with 
broad lanceolate dark green shining leaves, 
and a scape growing about three inches high, 
bearing several largish drooping light blue 
flowers, which resemble those of S. sibirica, 
and are produced in March and April. This 
species is a native of the Levant.

gardens can boast of too bountiful a supply. 

FLOWERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS.* 
BY ANNE PRATT. 

This work is calculated to please the lover 
of flowers, and even lay the foundation for a 
love of botany : there are thousands who 
love nature, but care little for the scientific 
arrangements of their odoriferous favourites, 
and in this little volume there is just enough 
to please these thousands. The writer seems 
always at home ; and if there be a fault, it is 
writing too flippantly on subjects, and sup- 
posed facts evidently borrowed. Rarely does 
the sentence, " there is nothing new under the 
sun," apply to any thing with such great force 
as to books on gardening. Those who read 
old works on the subject will recognise in 
almost all the modern publications a continued 
system of appropriating other people's ideas, 
and dressing them in a sort of disguise, but 
withal so flimsy as to be detected in almost 
all cases. The present little work pretends 
to nothing out of the common way, but it is 
possible to say too much. The authoress 
would be puzzled a little to prove that " our 
garden pansies have been introduced hither 
from various parts of the continent." Thomp- 
son of Iver has the merit of raising the ear- 
liest of our garden varieties, for the best that 
were known before were little better than 
weeds, and could never bear the title of garden 
varieties. However, we have no doubt the 
writer had read the fact somewhere. Never- 
theless, this volume is admirably adapted 
for youth. 

VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES 
USED FOR THE FOOD OF MAN.f 

Under this title two small volumes have 
been published, for the purpose of explaining 
chemically the nature of the numerous vege- 
tables which have been resorted to as food by 
the various classes of the community at home 
and abroad — the various plants and mode of 
using them, the nature of their constituent 
parts, the quantity of nourishment they con- 
tain and its value, and all the varied effects of 
their use as human food. We have the intro- 
duction, in which the writer, whose name is 
not given, proposes some odd theories as to 
what the earth would be without vegetation ; 
but we pass over this to general considerations 
on the nature of vegetable food, and thence to 
the classification of plants yielding nutritious

secretions : wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, 
maize, buckwheat, millet, leguminous plants, 
bread-fruit, the potato, arrow-root, sago, tur- 
nip, carrot, parsnip, cabbage, &c. Then plants 
containing sugar: the fig, vine, banana, date, 
&c. Then those containing oil, as the olive, 
and various nuts ; and so on, through all the 
classes of plants. It is a reprint of a work 
published by the Society for the Diffusion of 
Useful Knowledge, very considerably im- 
proved in respect to the chemical descriptions, 
and as such useful and very interesting to the 
young student in the chemistry of horticulture 
and agriculture. 

THE FIELD, THE GARDEN, AND THE 
WOODLAND.* 

BY ANNE PRATT. 

In this volume many interesting facts with 
which botanists become acquainted in the pur- 
suit of science, are collected and presented to 
the reader in familiar and agreeable language, 
well calculated to awaken some interest 
in the study and observation of nature — 
a study alike elevating and consoling in its 
influences on the mind. The fair authoress 
has not confined herself to the vegetation 
of Europe, but the whole world has been her 
woodland ; the gardens of all climates have 
supplied her with one of the powerful features 
of her work ; while the wild flowers of the 
field have been for the most part selected 
from subjects within the reach of all her 
English readers. The natures of the most 
remarkable plants, trees, flowers, and grasses, 
have been well explained in simple language, 
and there is a very proper feeling pervading 
those explanations wherein the wonderful 
provisions of the Creator are pointed out. It 
is a pocket volume that may be advantage- 
ously placed in the hands of youth.

Pjeonia Moutan, var. picta (painted 
Moutan). — Ranunculaceaa § Helleboreaa. — 
This is a very handsome variety of the well- 
known Pceonia Moutan, or tree paeony. Its 
habit is the same ; the segments of the leaves 
are narrower than in some varieties, of a dull 
bluish-green ; the flowers are semidouble, the 
ground colour light rose, streaked stained and 
veined with rich deep rose toward the edges ; 
the petals are rather ragged at the edges, 
something in the way of our parrot tulips. 
Native of China. Introduced in 1844. 
Flowers in May. Culture. — Almost hardy ; 
is the better for a little protection in spring ; 
rich sandy loam ; propagated by grafting on 
the roots of P. albiflora, or by division. (253) 

Cobubgia stylosa, Lindley (long- styled 
Coburgia). — Arnaryllidaceas § Amarylleae.— 
A pretty bulbous plant, with rigid acute 
glaucous leaves, and stems growing about two 
feet high, bearing an umbel of three to five 
tube-like flowers, each five inches long, and

Pentstemon gentianoides, var. alba (white 



gentian-like Pentstemon). — Scrophulariaceae § 
Antirrhinideai-Chelonese. — This is a white- 
flowered variety of P. gentianoides, a handsome 
half-shrubby and nearly hardy species now 
common in our gardens. It has the same habit, 
growing two feet and upwards in height, 
with long spikes of its tubular blossoms, and 
differs only in the colour of the flowers, in 
which particular it forms a very striking and 
admirable contrast. It has, no doubt, origi- 
nated in our gardens, and was raised about 
1845 ; but we have no information of its 
origin. Cidture. — Nearly hardy; common 
sarden loamy soil ; propagated freely bv cut- 
tings. '(257)

Though a handsome and distinct variety, it 
is not so strikingly beautiful as the old E. 
grandiflora. A garden hybrid raised by Mr. 
Ball of Taunton, about 1843 ? Culture. — 
Requires a greenhouse ; turfy sandy peat ; 
propagated by cuttings of the young shoots, 
planted in sand, under bell-glasses. (258)

state, by Dr. Herbert, in 1845. Flowers late 
in the autumn. It is nearly allied to C. Cart- 
wrightianus (Herbert) ; and also bears the 
names of C. hybernus (Fridwaldsky) ; and 
C. viontanus (Clusius). Cidture. — hardy ; 
common soil; propagated by offsets. (259) 

Crocus Pallasianus, Herbert (Pallas's 
Crocus), — Iridaceae. — A small and interesting 
bulbous plant, with about seven narrow leaves, 
and pale violet-coloured flowers, striated at 
the base, on the outside. Native of sunny 
hills in the Crimea. Introduced by Dr. 
Herbert, from a Ghent nursery in 1845 ? 
Flowers in the autumn months. It is the 
C. Pallasii (Marsch). Culture. — Hardy ; 
common soil ; propagated by offsets. (260) 

Hibiscus grossularlefolius, Miquel 
(gooseberry-leaved Hibiscus). — Malvacese § 
Hibisceas. — A handsome shrub, growing three 
to four feet high, with alternate, deeply three 
or five-lobed leaves, having some resemblance 
to those of the gooseberry. The flowers grow 
singly from the axils ; they are large and 
handsome, of a rich blueish-purple, the petals 
triangular, one of the upper angles rounded, 
the other mucronate. Native of the Swan

club-shaped, downy, and of a light purple-rose 
colour, they are also curved downwards. 
Native of Bogota. Introduced in 1845. 
Flowers freely in summer. Culture. — Re- 
quires a greenhouse, or cool stove ; rich loamy

The leaves are three or four inches long, 
broad-linear, or linear-lanceolate, downy or 
silky, especially at the margins. The flowers 
are yellow, villous, and grow in dense terminal 
heads, which are sometimes clustered several 
together. Native of the Swan River colony.

perennial, with large oblong lanceolate leaves, 
and a slender stem bearing from six to eight 
flowers, nearly white, faintly tinged with 
blush, and with a pale violet lip. Native of 
Japan, according to Messrs. Loddiges. In- 
troduced in 1843. Flowers in April. It is 
the Calantlie gebina of Messrs. Loddiges' 
catalogue. Culture. — Nearly hardy, may be 
grown in a greenhouse or pit ; flbry peat

The pseudo-bulbs bear one or two oblong 
undulated leaves ; the flowers, which grow 
in short drooping racemes, are greenish 
white, the lip pure white. In Chinese draw- 
ings this plant is represented as bearing yellow 
flowers ; Mr. Fortune also sent it as a yellow- 
flowered Coelogyne ; but our climate does not 
seem to produce such. Native of China, on 
mountain sides, Hong Kong. Introduced in

Angelonia angustifolia, Bentham (nar- 
row-leaved Angelonia). — Scrophulariaceas § 
Antirrhinidese-Hemimerideas. — A dwarf 
growing annual (?) plant of considerable 
beauty, attaining about a foot in height, with 
upright slender stems, the upper part of which 
is furnished with, flowers from the axils of the 
leaves, forming a long leafy raceme. The 
leaves are narrowly lance-shaped, and acute ; 
the flowers are moderate-sized, violet-coloured, 
and in form resembling those of the common 
Alonsoas. The plant has the habit and ap- 
pearance of Angelonia salicarcefolia, but is 
much smaller and more slender, and with the 
individual flowers about half as large. Native 
of Xalapa, in Mexico. Introduced by Mr. 
Hartweg in 1846. Flowers in July. Cul- 
ture. — Requires a cool stove ; turfy loam and 
leaf mould ; propagated by cuttings (?) or by 
seeds (?), or probably by both. (269)

CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS, 

AND ORIGINAL NOTES CONNECTED WITH HORTICULTURE 
AND NATURAL HISTORY. 

Red spider. — To get rid of this pest when 
once established in a house, wash the flues or 
hot-water pipes with black sulphur mixed up 
with water ; this must be done when the pipes 
are cold. When heat is applied the fumes of 
the sulphur will destroy the red spider, which 
is a small species of Acarus. To prevent 
their becoming established in a house, keep a 
moist and sweet atmosphere. 

Garden walks. — Where it is difficult — 
as it sometimes is — to get good binding gravel 
for forming garden walks, they may be made 
tolerably firm for the summer, by having them 
broken up in spring, say six inches deep (there 
should be at least this depth of gravel), and 
taking out a portion at one end, turning the 
whole regularly back in the way of trenching, 
saturating it at the same time with water in 
which clay has been dissolved to the consist- 
ence of very thin paint ; they must be made 
solid and level, and well rolled while wet, and 
then allowed to become quite dry before they 
are used, which takes a fortnight or so accord- 
ing to the weather. 

Small birds are very destructive both to 
seeds, either sown or being saved, and also 
to the buds of fruit trees. Of the means em- 
ployed to frighten them away, that of having 
some cats tied up in different parts of the 
garden, is perhaps as good as any. The same 
end may be in a great measure attained by 
domesticating cats in a garden. 

Preserving vegetables, &c. — It some- 
times happens that particular crops come to 
perfection faster than they are used. When 
it is required to preserve them, this may be 
done in most cases for at least a week, by 
cutting or gathering them just as they are 
fully grown, and laying them on the brick or 
stone floor of a cool store-house, or root-room. 
Cauliflowers, lettuces, &c. should be cut with 
the outside leaves ; asparagus should be tied 
in bundles and set upright with the lower 
ends in water ; French beans, when scarce, 
may be set close together with the stalk in a 
shallow pan of water, and, when more abundant, 
may, as well as peas, be spread on a clean 
part of the floor, and loosely covered. 

Glazing. — Where, from economical mo- 
tives, the repairing of damages in the sashes 
of garden-frames is done at home, it may be 
useful to know how to make putty. It is done 
thus : — With ten pounds of whitening, and 
one pound of white-lead, mix a sufficient 
quantity of boiled linseed-oil, and a wineglass- 
full of sweet -oil. The proper quantity of oil 
will be ascertained by mixing gradually. The 
sweet-oil prevents the lead from hardening, 



and preserves the putty. Where this course 
is adopted, all the frames should be glazed 
with the same-sized glass — of which a stock 
should be kept on hand, it being often of im- 
portance to have repairs of this kind attended 
to without delay. 

Earwigs. — The best remedy for these is to 
trap them, and this is both tedious and in- 
effectual, as fresh swarms take the place of those 
which are destroyed. Any hollow bodies will 
serve to trap them — such as inverted flower- 
pots rested on the stakes ; bean-stalks cut into 
lengths and laid among the branches ; the 
wood of elder divested of the pith, or pieces 
of bamboo-cane : in all these cases one end 
should be closed while the other is left open. 
These traps should be examined every morn- 
ing, and the entrapped insects shaken out into 
a pan of scalding water. 

Transplanting seedlings. — All the culi- 
nary crops which are raised from seeds, and 
planted out subsequently, are the better for 
being " pricked out " or transplanted, at least 
once before they are finally placed ; this is 
best done when they have formed two or 
three pairs of leaves. Plant on fresh dug 
ground, using a dibble or blunt-pointed stick 
to fix the plants ; thrust this somewhat ob- 
liquely into the soil, deep enough to allow 
the roots to be placed straight ; then with the 
point of the dibble press the soil down firmly 
to the roots. Seedlings should be taken up 
with a trowel, and the side roots, as far as 
possible, retained ; tap roots should be short- 
ened back. If clone in dry weather, dip the 
roots in a puddle formed by mixing a rich 
compost with water. 

Worms on lawns are very troublesome 
when numerous, especially in spring and au- 
tumn, by throwing up their casts, which dis- 
figure the turf and are tedious to remove : to 
lessen their numbers, water the turf with one 
of the following mixtures : — A quarter of an 
ounce of corrosive sublimate dissolved in 
three gallons of water ; one pound of caustic 
lime, mixed with twenty gallons of water, and 
allowed to subside — use the clear liquid ; or 
one pound and a half of salt, dissolved in four 
gallons of water. Give the ground a good 
soaking of the mixture, when it is 'previously 
well moistened by rain or by the artificial 
application of water. 

Preserving apples and pears. — Such 
fruits as the late kinds of apples and pears, 
which it is desired to keep for a length of 
time, must be gathered and conveyed to the 
fruit-room without sustaining any bruises ; 
they should hang until they are mature or 
until in danger from severe frost. After 
lying singly on the shelves of the fruit-room, 
for a week or two, they should be packed in 
jars among dry sand, and set in a cool uni-

form temperature. When required for use, 
they should be unpacked a few at a time, in 
the order in which the different varieties 
ripen ; and after laying a few days in the 
cool atmosphere of the fruit-room, they should 
be submitted for a day or two more, just 
before they are wanted, to a temperature of 
about sixty degrees. This applies to the later 
kinds. The choice fruits of the summer and 
autumn kinds should be as carefully gathered, 
and removed to the fruit-room until they are 
wanted for use. 

Preserving wall fruits. — Such fruits as 
the peach, apricot, plum, &c. may be kept 
for a week or more, if gathered when ripe, 
and laid carefully without a bruise and thinly 
on the shelves of a dry cool fruit-room, where 
there is a uniform low temperature. The 
same principle must be followed when it is 
required to keep such small fruits as straw- 
berries, raspberries, cherries, gooseberries, 
currants, &c. for a few days. 

American blight. — In the Horticultural 
Society's garden, a number of apple-trees 
affected by the American blight have been 
cleared by the use of coal-tar naphtha applied 
with a small brush. The least touch of the 
naphtha destroys the insects ; but, in order 
to economise labour as well as material, it is 
desirable to cut away or shorten in all in- 
fested twigs that can be spared, previous to 
dressing the trees. When the pest is esta- 
blished it takes some perseverance and watch- 
fulness, however, to get quite rid of it, for, if 
neglected for a time, a fresh race springs up. 
The matter is, however, worth perseverance, 
and if this be bestowed, a complete cure will 
in due time be effected. 

Fairbeard's Champion of England fea. 
— This has been grown in the Chiswiek gar- 
den, and is reported as a variety meriting 
attention. The pods are large, and well 
filled with large — perhaps, for some, too large 
— peas; but they are tender, and of good 
quality, and are, therefore, worthy of being 
cultivated. 

Herbaceous inarching wall trees. — 
Various means are resorted to by gardeners 
to supply a deficiency of branches in wall 
trees, and with greater or less success ; we 
imagine, however, that the following French 
mode, which may be termed herbaceous in- 
arching, so far at least as the scion is con- 
cerned, offers advantages over every other 
plan at present in use. It is adopted in the 
Horticultural Society's garden, and consists 
in inarching the growing extremities of ad- 
joining shoots to the parts of the stem from 
which it is desirable branches should proceed. 
A small slice is taken off near the extremity 
of the young shoot, and a corresponding ex- 
tent of surface immediately below the inner 



bark of the stem is exposed ; the two are 
joined together and a perfect union is very 
soon effected. By this means tiers of horizon- 
tals in young trees may be formed without 
disappointment, and branches may be replaced 
in old trees more readily than by the old 
mode of side-grafting or budding. — G. C 

Earthing up culinary crops, such as 
cauliflowers, brocoli, beans, &c. is often at- 
tended with more injury than benefit. This 
is usually the case, when the draw-hoe only 
is used in performing the operation, its work 
being superficial, and the trampling back- 
wards and forwards between the rows, ren- 
dering the spaces between them almost as 
hard as gravel -walks, thus forming ditches 
in wet weather, and breaking into great 
cracks and fissures during periods of drought. 
In the case of crops which it is desirable to 
earth up in this manner, the spaces between 
the ridges should, after the other part of the 
operation is completed, be well broken up 
with the fork or the pronged hoe ; and in 
this way the advantages of surface-stirring 
will be realized. 

Mildew on greenhouse plants. — It 
often happens that hard-wooded greenhouse 
plants of the more delicate kinds, such as 
chorozemas, for example, suffer much during 
the summer season from attacks both of mil- 
dew and of red acarus (or red spider, as it is 
commonly called). They must, therefore, be 
closely watched. To guard against these 
pests, both as concerns these and similar 
plants, it is a good plan to lay the plants on 
their sides and give them a thorough syring- 
ing with clear water ; and then, while they 
are wet, to dust the plants over, both the 
under and upper side of the leaves, with sul- 
phur. In a week or ten daj'S this may be 
washed off. This will generally clear the 
plants for the season. The washing or syring- 
ing should be a bona fide one. The pots may 
be supported in a one-sided direction by set- 
ting two bricks V fashion, but not quite close 
together, against which to lean them ; the 
syringing will then command the under-side 
of the leaves and branches, as well as the 
upper and lateral surfaces. It is not a few 
syringefuls of water either that will suffice for 
these washings. Every plant, of any size, 
should have two or three gallons of water, or 
more, thrown over them, and usually with as 
much force as the syringe will command : of 
course a little judgment must be exercised, so 
as not to drive the water in a direction to 
break or damage the plants. By leaning the 
pots in the way recommended, too, another 
advantage is gained ; most of the water drips 
off instead of — as it would otherwise do — 
of running down the stems, and injuriously 
saturating the soil in the pots. 



DIPLADENIA SPLENDENS. 



529 




Peeuaps there is hardly a family of stove climbing plants 
more splendid than the Echites when well grown ; indeed, 
whether the plants are skilfully cultivated or not, the flowers, 
when they are produced, are in most cases grand and striking. 
The Dipladenias form a group of species which botanists have 
found it convenient to detach from the extensive family of 
Echites : several of them are popular plants at the present 
day, among which are the species whose name heads these 
remarks (and which is — not well — represented in the engrav- 
ing) ; D. crassinoda, a good deal like it, but perhaps a better 
species on the whole. for cultural purposes ; and J}, atropur- 
purea, which with the same habit of growth has flowers of 
a rich deep purplish tint. 

Our present subject may be popularly described as follows: 
— Stems shrubby, vigorous, and growing to a considerable 
length, smooth, and round. Lea yes nearly stalkless, wavy, 
somewhat leathery, elliptic-acuminate, with a heart-shaped 
base, from four to eight inches long, and from one and a half 
to three inches broad ; they are pubescent, especially on the 
under side, and the veining is prominent. Flowers very 
showy, in axillary four to six-flowered racemes, longer than 
the leaves, the tube of the corolla is about an inch and a half 
long, with a large spreading limb of five roundish, rose 
coloured lobes, each having a small oblique point ; these blos- 
soms are produced in the summer months. 

The species is a native of the Organ Mountains of Brazil, 
from whence it appears to have been first ob- 
tained for our gardens by Mr. Lobb, the bota- 
nical collector to Messrs. Veitch of Exeter : it 
was introduced about 1841. It belongs to the 
natural order Apocynacea?. 

In cultivation, this species of Dipladenia in 
common with the others requires stove tem- 
perature, and a moist atmosphere when making 
its growth ; it is moreover much benefited by 
mild bottom heat, that is, heat applied to its 
roots. Being a strong grower, plenty of pot 
room must be allowed to obtain a good plant, 
but the pots must be thoroughly drained ; a

J 



compost of equal parts turfy loam and peat, 
opened if necessary by the addition of sand, 
will be a proper medium for its roots. If 
grown in a pot, spiral training round a pillar 
trellis is most suitable; or should any devotee 
of flat, shield, or peacock's-tail trellises be- 
come possessed of the plant under notice, if he 
will but attempt to train it over one or other 
of these forms — it may help to lead him to a 
better taste in this respect. It may be in- 
creased by cuttings planted in sand, and 
placed in a mild hotbed, where they may be 
kept moderately close until rooted.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER, 




THE KITCHEN GARDEN. 

Sow a few more peas and beans about 
Christmas. 

Plant and transplant nothing unless the 
weather be very open and dry, when such as 
cabbages and even potatoes may be put in with 
safety. 

General Directions. — Under this head may 
be included all that it is necessary to attend 
to. Persevere in draining, manuring, digging, 
trenching, and ridging the unoccupied ground. 
The wheeling of manure, soil, &c, should be 
always, if possible, done in frosty weather, 
and in the early part of the day. Spread the 
manure where there is any danger of the 
ground getting too hard ; strawy litter may 
also be strewed over the celery ridges, the 
beds of young plants, and every place where 
frost is likely to do injury ; the drier the 
material, and the looser it is put on, the more 
successfully will it resist the cold. The ma- 
Jung and relaying of walks may be proceeded 
with. The thorough preparation of the ground 
for new plantations of asparagus, rhubarb, 
and seakale should now have attention ; it 
should be trenched three feet deep and well 
enriched with manure, as seaweed, dung, sand, 
an 1 fresh loam. Get a supply of labels and stakes 
ready for use when wanted. The brocoli must 
be often looked over, and the mature heads 



cut, and others secured from frost. The Brus- 
sels sprouts require the latter attention : 
do not think of cutting the tops off these too 
soon, as is sometimes done. The young cauli- 
flowers should have the soil stirred about 
them, and air admitted freely when mild ; the 
same with lettuce, &c. Look over the stored 
potatoes, carrots, onions, &c, and take out all 
those which are decaying ; of course the latter 
operations suit wet weather. Turn anew the 
composts and ground in the open breaks when 
dry and frosty ; and see that even winter-work 
be done tastefully. 

THE FRUIT GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Persevere with the 
winter operations until they are finished. The 
orchard, which is usually the last place of 
pruning, must not be skipped over. Take 
every tree seriatim as on the walls, and make 
it appear evident that the gardener has been 
over them : allow no branches to cross each 
other, nor to become rambling ; make the tree 
as a whole look flat, open, and dwarf, as no 
form admits more sun to the fruit, nor is better 
adapted to withstand storms. Continue plant- 
ing, and draining beforehand, seldom making 
a pit, for it is desirable that the roots be near 
the surface ; attend to staking and tying them 
firm. The prunings may be all charred, and 
made again available in the soil, and the com- 
posts used for the trees. As much of the 
surface as possible should be exposed to the 
beneficial influences of frosty weather, by being 
frequently turned over. 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER. 



531 



THE FORCING GARDEN. 

General Directions. — Everything being 
ready, the earliest houses may be shut up, 
giving a little air during the day, if sunny ; 
use the syringe freely. Have every thing well 
secured from frost ; and shrink from the idea 
of losing anything from carelessness : never- 
theless covering may be, and is at times in- 
jurious ; therefore, in many cases, it will be 
necessary to exercise skill in determining how 
to afford protection ; when there is any risk 
it is best to err on the safe side. 

Asparagus. — Temperature from 50 to 60 
degrees. When in pits or frames give a little 
air about midday ; prepare for a successional 
supply. 

Cucumbers. — Temperature from 55 to 60 
degrees by night, rising to 70 by sun heat. 
Keep the fruit and wood thin ; syringe often 
if fire heat is much in request ; otherwise it is 
necessary to guard against damp in this the 
darkest month. When there is no other con- 
venience, a dung-bed seed-frame may be put 
up, and in this case sow early next month. 

Figs. — Temperature from 50 to 70 degrees. 
This only applies to those in pits, which it is 
presumed are pretty forward ; apply the 
syringe freely when fire heat is required, not 
otherwise. 

Kidney Beans. — Temperature from 50 to 
70 degrees. Sow for succession at the end of 
the month, either in pots or boxes ; where 
there is plenty of room, plant three in a 
smallish pot. This will be found advan- 
tageous, as then they only require one other 
shift ; give them all the light possible, and 
syringe them twice a day. 

Melons may be forwarded in pots by being 
put near the glass, and having plenty of air 
and moisture, and a heat of 70 degrees ; pre- 
pare a seed bed for cucumbers and them, and 
have the dung thoroughly sweetened by fre- 
quent turnings ; common stable litter requires 
six weeks' preparation before it is in a proper 
condition for this purpose. 

Mint, Tarragon, and other herbs, may be 
forced in boxes, placed either in the pine stove 
or early vinery, or where they will have about 
55 degrees of heat and plenty of light ; the 
roots can simply be lifted out of the ground, 
and forced at once. 

Mushrooms. — Temperature from 55 to 60 
degrees. This is one of the most useful houses 
at present, and every corner should be filled 
with such as rhubarb, seakale, and even aspa- 
ragus : devote one corner to the increasing of 
spawn, by having some prepared strawy dung 
in a medium state of wetness and decay, 
amongst which thrust a few handfuls of loose 
spawn from the old beds : beat the whole firmly 
together, and in a few days it will be ready 



for distributing over the new bed. The spawn 
thus procured is equal to that made in bricks, 
and is more easily procured : a dry heat must 
never be found here. 

Mustard and Cress. — Temperature 60 de- 
grees. It will be found to grow best in old 
decayed tan ; place it near the glass in such 
structures as the pine stove, and give it little 
water ; if the house is moist and there is no 
sun it will require none. 

Musas. — Temperature from 55 to 70 de- 
grees. Continue w r ith a low temperature to 
give little water ; admit air when mild. 

Oranges.' — Temperature from 40 to 55 de- 
grees. Keep sponging the dirty plants ; and, 
if any transplanting is to take place, now is a 
good time ; they delight in a loamy rich soil, 
well drained. Cut out all irregular branches, 
and pick off every yellow leaf as it appears. 

Peaches and Nectarines. — Temperature 
from 45 to 55 degrees. Those in pots may be 
ready for disblossoming, if not disbudding, by 
the end of the month ; the one is as useful an 
operation as the other : syringe freely, and 
maintain a steady heat. The early house 
may be started now by merely shutting it up 
closely at night, giving air daily, and putting 
a little fire in at the end of the month ; syringe 
in the mornings, and shut up early. 

Pine Apples. — Temperature from 55 to 70 
degrees. See that none of the fruiting plants 
want water ; keep up the heat in the pits and 
frames by covering up at night, renewing 
linings, &c. Use as little fire heat as possible ; 
it may be requisite at times during the day, 
in order to give air : syringe occasionally in 
the mornings, but sparingly. 

Rhubarb. — Temperature 55 degrees. Water 
that in the houses with tepid water ; see that 
the heat is not strong about that which is 
being forced out of doors, as it is apt to draw 
very weak. The same may be said of sea- 
kale. At the end of the. month a successional 
crop must be covered up. 

Strawberries. — Temperature from 50 to 55 
degrees. Syringe freely those advanced in 
growth, but give very little water to those 
newly brought in ; keep all near the glass, 
and the house clean and healthful, by airing, 
watering and fumigating. 

Vineries. — Those in pots when 
should have a heat of 60 degrees at night, 
and 70 degrees or more by sunheat. Shut up 
the early house ; bring in a quantity of fer- 
menting manure, or leaves and dung mixed ; 
syringe freely in the middle of the day, and 
shut up early. Have the late houses pruned 
soon.

GARDENING CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER. 



General Directions. — "When no great altera- 
tions are being effected, a tidiness and fresh- 
ness must characterize the whole : indeed, the 
shrubbery should be very lively, aye "clothed 
in living green," whilst the Christmas Rose, 
the Arbutus, the Laurustinus, the Caprifo- 
lium, &c. will make it cheerful to walk in. 
The flower garden now must occupy much 
thought ; it is well to have a plan, so arranged 
as to be a guide in determining what plants 
will be wanted to fill the beds next year. 
Have the cutting frame or pit early in opera- 
tion. Neither waste time nor space in in- 
creasing plants for this object, merely because 
they are new ; they must have bright colours, 
good habits, or strong odours, before they 
can be worthy of being substituted for many 
of the bedding-out plants now common. A 
little thought on this matter will show that 
justice has not been done to many things 
which are not new, but possessed of properties 
which with proper attention and being put in 
masses, have a fine effect. The protection of 
tender plants, the sweeping and rolling of the 
lawn, wheeling and turning composts, and 
digging-in the same, also a general pruning of 
the evergreens, if not done, should be pro- 
ceeded with. Nothing can be added by way of 
detail further than this, that the sooner bulbs, 
shrubs, and hardy herbaceous plants are in 
the position they are to flower in, the better. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

In case of severe weather even the hardiest 
shrubs and evergreens will be benefited by 
protection, either afforded by removal into the 
house, or by the fitting of canvass or other 
screens over the balconies or other situations 
in which they are placed. Every plant not 
perfectly hardy must be kept under cover in 
all but the finest weather, when there is no 
frost, in which case they should have all the air 
they can get ; and such a time should also be 
taken advantage of to wash and clean such as 
are getting dusty or dirty. Water may also 
be rather freely applied at such times, but it 
should always be done early in the morning. 
If any of the plants get frosted, remove them 
to a shady situation the first thing in the 
morning, and syringe them well with cold water. 

Bulbs, such as hyacinths, crocus, &c, should 
be brought forward regularly in a warm place 
to succeed those previously advanced. The 
single hyacinths will be found the best for 
early forcing ; the double varieties being gene- 
rally much later in flowering. 

Begonias. — Still keep the bulbs in a state 
of rest, allowing no moisture — unless they 
shrivel too much. 

Camellias. — Increase the quantity of water 
to such as are advancing, but be careful not 
to apply too much ; a i'aw more may be 



advanced in the same way as pointed out last 
month. 

Cinerarias. — Allow some of the most for- 
ward to shoot up for flowering, giving all the 
air the weather will allow. Water cautiously 
in gloomy weather. 

Fuchsias. — Maintain these in a dry state of 
rest, applying no water unless absolutely ne- 
cessary. 

Geraniums. — Still keep these as dry as 
practicable, guarding against frost, by which 
they are soon destroyed : cover them up well, 
if no fire can be made near them, but mind 
they do not get too dry if the fire heat be long 
continued. 

JSTyrtles and similar evergreens should 
have all the air the state of the weather will 
permit, and should be often examined to see 
that they do not suffer for want of water. 

Hoses. — The Chinese varieties should be 
continued in a warm place, giving them all 
the air possible, and using water with great 
caution. 

Primulas. — Protect from cold, keeping the 
plants rather dry in damp gloomy weather. 
Give a slight shift to any that may require it, 
and water very cautiously for a time after- 
wards. 

Violets. — Attend to previous directions, 
and be very particular in the application of 
moisture. 

Wardian Cases. — G-uard against damp and 
frost. The latter would do much damage 
even to common hardy plants if it once pene- 
trate to them when placed in such conditions 
as those they are exposed to in these cases. It 
is therefore advisable to keep the plants and 
the earth in which they grow in as dry a state 
as their well-being will permit. But they 
should not be liable to be affected by frost; 
all moveable cases should be put safely under 
cover during night and unfavourable periods ; 
and such as are stationary outside the house 
should be well protected by mats from the 
severity of the weather. In order to keep the 
plants dry and healthy, air should be given as 
often as possible, and they should be also 
examined at the same time, and insects, dead 
leaves, &c. removed as often as necessary. 

PITS AND FRANCES. 

The principal operations will consist in pro- 
viding means to resist the increase of cold, 
and to prevent the effect of damp on the 
plants, by means of airing and the occasional 
use of fires in such of the pits as are con- 
structed for that purpose. 

Annuals. — Give air by tilting the lights 
whenever the weather permits, and use water 
only where absolutely necessary, and then in 
very small quantities ; remove the covering 
a veiy day except in the most severe weather, 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER.

to keep the plants from drawing up weak and 
becoming blanched. 

Half hardy plants, as calceolarias, petunias, 
verbenas, &c. — Maintain a dry atmosphere by 
the applying very little water, free ventila- 
tion, and the occasional use of fires to dry the 
pits. Cover up early in the afternoon, and 
never allow the mats or other material used to 
remain over the plants two days together if it 
can be avoided. 

Forcing Pit. — Keep up a medium tempe- 
rature, if anything a little higher than last 
month, giving air on all favourable occasions, 
and closing up early. Water sparingly in dull 
weather. Keep up the supply of roses and 
other shrubs by introducing fresh batches of 
them once or twice during the month, and re- 
move such as are far enough advanced to the 
conservatory. Also bring forward fresh batches 
of hyacinths and other bulbs ; and a few 
pinks, violets, lilies of the valley, &c. may 
be forwarded, observing to excite them very 
slowly at first. 

THE GREENHOUSE. 

Temperature. — From 40 to 50 degrees by 
day ; and from 36 to 40 degrees by night. 

Ventilation. — Give air on all fine days 
when not too cold, taking advantage of such 
times to dry the house with a little extra fire 
if the weather has been dull. Use as little fire 
at night as is possible, consistent with the 
safety of the plants. 

Watering. — Attend to previous directions, 
applying moisture with the greatest circum- 
spection at this dull period. 

Potting. — Avoid shifting the plants except 
where absolutely necessary, as the new soil 
round the roots is apt to be injurious, espe- 
cially if it gets too damp. All bad weather 
should be taken advantage of to wash and sort 
dirty pots, and collect crocks and drainage. A 
good supply of these various articles should 
always be kept at hand in a dry place. 

Soils. — Turn over compost heaps in dry 
frosty weather, exposing the interior to the 
action of the weather, and carefully picking 
out all grubs or other insects. Ridge the 
heaps up neatly, so as to save the mould from 
being too much washed by heavy rains. 

Dressing. — Keep a steady eye on the neat 
appearance of the house and plants, and re- 
stake and label any that may require it. 
Sticks and labels may also be prepared in bad 
weather, and be sorted and put by ready for 
use when required. 

Insects. — Look well after all insects, espe- 
cially green fly if the house receives much fire 
heat, when they will soon begin to increase 
too fast. 

Aloes and succulents generally, should still 
be kept dry, and not allowed to start in growth 



until the days begin to draw out considerably. 
Give very little water, just enough to keep 
them from shrivelling. 

Agaves and larger succulents should be 
treated as before recommended, receiving little 
or no water. 

Ahtromerias should still be kept cool and 
quiescent. A cold frame not too clamp is the 
best situation for them. Give all the air con- 
sistent with keeping the frost from the tubers. 

Annuals, such as are kept in the house, 
should enjoy as much air and light as possible, 
and such as are growing too fast may be 
topped in order to get them bushy. Water 
only when thoroughly necessary. 

Azaleas. — Maintain a succession of flowers 
by placing a few more plants in warmth, and 
remove such as are sufficiently advanced to 
the conservatory. Water rather freely as the 
plants begin to grow. 

Calceolarias — Keep these plants cool and 
airy, but beware of stagnant water or sod- 
dened mould about their roots. 

Camellias. — Keep up the succession of 
blooming plants by placing a few more in a 
slight heat, and increase of moisture ; remove 
such as are expanding their flowers to a warm 
part of the conservatory. 

Cape Bulbs, as ixias, gladiolus, &c. must 
still be kept dormant, in order to enable them 
to push with the greater vigour when potted 
and excited in the spring. 

Cephalotus follicular is (New Holland pitcher- 
plant). — Keep it protected from damp by 
raising the bell-glass, and allowing the super- 
fluous water about the roots to drain freely 
away. 

Cinerarias. — Forward such as require it 
by shifting, and place a few more of the most 
forward in heat, to keep up a succession of 
bloom. Water frequently ; a little clear 
manure-water may be used in fine weather. 

Chrysanthemums. — Continue to remove the 
plants from the house as they become shabby, 
and protect them in the best manner avail- 
able ; water regularly such as are still retained 
in the house. 

Crassulas, and allied plants, as sempervi- 
vum, should still be kept in a light dry ex- 
posure, and scantily watered. 

Cyclamens. — Encourage such as are grow- 
ing by placing them in a light airy situa- 
tion, and watering regularly but not too co- 
piously. 

Epacris. — A few plants may be placed in 
a slight heat, and the supply of water be 
gradually increased j keep the others cool 
and airy. 

Ericas. — Maintain the freest ventilation 
consistent with the safety of the plants from 
frost ; water just sufficiently to keep the roots 
in an equable moist state, and also to guard 



534 



GARDENING CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER. 



against any excess of moisture either at the 
roots or anywhere in the house. Never use 
fire to these plants unless in cases of absolute 
necessity, and then ventilate freely. 

Fuchsias. — Still keep these in a state of rest, 
unless any are wanted to propagate from, when 
they may be gradually excited, so as to furnish 
cuttings in a month or two. 

Gompholobiums and slender creepers should 
be kept as previously recommended, great care 
being taken to prevent danger to the roots by 
over watering. 

Haworthias, Apicras, &c. — Keep these 
plants still in a dry state, using water only 
when necessary to keep them alive. 

Helichrysums. — "Water carefully and pre- 
serve the plants from damp and cold. 

Leschenaultias. — Keep these in a dry place, 
and use water with great caution, in order to 
prevent the decay and death of the plants 
by piecemeal. 

Lilium japonicum (Japan lily). — Keep 
these roots still dormant, as the growth they 
could make during the present dull weather 
could hardly produce a fine bloom. 

Mignonette. — Keep all the plants in a cool 
dry situation, watering with great caution. 
Trim up the tree mignonette as previously 
recommended, and guard against green fly. 

New Holland plants, as acacias, hoveas, 
bossiams, &c. should still be kept cool and 
airy, and should be regularly and very care- 
fully watered. A few small plants of Acacia 
armata may be placed in the forcing-house, 
and gradually brought forward. 

Orange trees. — Water carefully and give 
plenty of air. A few of the smaller plants 
may be placed in heat for the sake of their 
fragrant blossoms. 

Oxalis. — Keep these dry and as dormant as 
possible ; even the stemmed species require 
very little water now. 

Pelargoniums. — Maintain these in a gently 
growing state, giving air as often as possible 
to prevent their drawing up weakly, and stop 
and regulate the branches, using as few sticks 
for supports as possible. Water regularly but 
not too freely yet. Introduce a succession to 
the forcing-house as often as necessary. 

Primulas. — Shift such as require larger 
pots, and remove the flowers from such plants 
as are wanted vei'y strong to flower late in 
the season. Keep the plants rather moist and 
airy, removing all damp or decaying leaves as 
soon as they change. 

Proteus, Banhsias, Dryandras, &c. — 
Continue these in a light airy place, watering 
with great caution. 

Rhododendrons. — Continue the previous 
treatment, using water with circumspection. 
Introduce a few more to the forcing-house, 
and remove those sufficiently advanced in 



bloom to the conservatory. Increase the 
allowance of water to such as are being forced. 

Roses. — Any of the Chinese or allied sorts 
about to flower should be encouraged by a 
warm berth, and an increased supply of 
moisture. Those turned out in the house 
should not be excited yet, but be kept rather 
cool and dry. 

Salvias. — See former directions. All the 
sorts should be kept as dry as possible at the 
root, so long as they do not perish. 

Stapelias should be kept dormant until the 
spring is well advanced, as any growth they 
may make during winter will be far too weak 
to form stout flowering branches. 

Tropceolums. — Continue to carefully train 
those that have started, covering the bottom 
of the trellis well in the first instance. 
Water carefully, keeping the mould in a 
regular damp state, by no means soddened. 
Place the plants where they will get the 
full advantage of light and air, and not be 
liable to be drawn into a weak straggling 
growth. 

THE CONSERVATORY. 

Temperature. — About 55 degrees by day, 
and from 45 to 50 degrees by night. Apply 
fires in cold weather if the above heat cannot 
be maintained without. 

Ventilation. — Give air on all favourable 
opportunities, avoiding all strong draughts, 
and closing the house early in the afternoon. 

Watering. — Use water sparingly, but do 
not allow any plants to suffer for want of it. 
Plants in flower, especially those brought in 
from the forcing-pit, will of course require 
most, but it must be given cautiously even to 
these in gloomy weather. 

Arrangement. — Alterations in the grouping 
of the plants should be constantly studied, and 
different effects tried, so as to arrive at a 
knowledge of the arrangement best suited to 
the house. At this season an excellent effect 
may be produced by introducing baskets, 
vases, &c. at the intersections of the walks or 
in similar places, filled with hyacinths and 
other bulbs. One mass of bright colours seen 
thus is more effective than double the number of 
plants stuck about among those not in bloom. 

General Directions. — Attend to what has 
been said under this head in previous months. 
At this dull season the opportunity should 
be taken to search the plants for scale and 
other insects, and no pains should be spared 
to thoroughly extirpate them. Similar bad or 
broken weather should also be employed in 
providing a good supply of stakes and tallies 
of proper sizes, and also to use them when 
requisite. All permanent and large labels 
should also be renewed or repaired, as the time 
can be better spared now to have them done

535 



neatly, than if they are left to a more busy 
season. 

THE PLANT STOVE. 

Temperature. — About 60 degrees by day, 
and about 50 degrees at night. 

Ventilation. — Great care is necessary in 
the admission of air ; the requisite tempera- 
ture must be maintained, and even then all 
strong draughts must be strictly avoided. A 
regular fire will be necessary ; and by using 
this rather briskly in the morning, sufficient 
air may be given without detriment to the 
plants, observing to close the house early. 

Watering. — Always use water of the same 
temperature or rather higher than that of the 
house, so that when applied the roots of the 
plants may not be chilled by a stream of cold 
water passing over and among them. Use 
water very sparingly, especially in dull cold 
weather. 

Potting. — Shift only such as absolutely 
require it, but provide a proper supply of 
pots, composts, crocks, &c. to start with when 
the time for more active exertions arrives. 

Insects. — Always bear in mind the reite- 
rated necessity of constantly waging war upon 
all descriptions of injurious insects, and act 
accordingly. 

Achimenes. — Keep up the succession by 
exciting another batch of roots this month, 
and steadily encourage the advance of those 
already growing, by placing them in a warm 
place near the glass, so as to receive all the 
light the season affords. 

Allamanda, Beaumontia, Echites, and all 
strong growing climbers, should be pruned as 
far as requisite while in a state of rest, so as 
to avoid the bleeding of the wounds, which 
takes place copiously if they are cut when 
growing. 

Alpinias, Hedychiums, and other reedy 
plants, should be kept at rest, removing the 
foliage as it decays, but giving very little water 
until it is necessary to start them again. 

Aphelandras, Justicias, Ruellias, &c. — Cut 
down such as go out of bloom, and gradually 
withhold water and heat as they show symp- 
toms of rest. 

Amaryllids. — Only encourage growth in 
such as throw up the flower stems : these 
should be kept rather moist as they advance. 

Begonias: — Adhere to last month's direc- 
tions, and use water with caution even to any 
that may be growing freely. 

Burchellia. — Advance those steadily which 
were placed in heat last month, but keep the 
others cool and at rest. 

Cacti. — Introduce a few more to the forcing 
pit, and remove those sufficiently advanced to 
a warm part of the conservatory ; keep the 
others dormant. 



Cinnamomum (Cinnamon tree). — Guard 
carefully against excess of moisture, and keep 
the plants warm. 

Clerodendrons. — About the end of the 
month a plant or two may be potted in fresh 
rich soil, and gradually excited, giving little 
water at first, but supplying it abundantly as 
the plants advance, using manure- water occa- 
sionally. Syringe frequently, and guard against 
mealy bug and green fly. The other plants 
should still be kept dormant. 

Climbers. — Continue last month's directions 
until all are properly done, and gradually in- 
crease the amount of water to such as com- 
mence growing. 

Daturas. — Continue to rest the majority of 
these. Eyes of the old wood should be potted 
in light sandy soil, and plunged in a brisk 
bottom heat : when rooted they should be 
potted singly in a free rich soil, and grown 
away rapidly, syringing and giving abundance 
of water as they advance. 

Erythrinas. — Start an old plant in bottom 
heat, and thin out the shoots as soon as firm 
enough to put in as cuttings, treating them in 
a similar way to the daturas. 

Euphorbias. — Adhere to last month's direc- 
tions in the case of these plants. 

Ferns. — Keep them comparatively dry and 
airy, in order to correct any tendency to 
damp off. 

Gardenias. — Steadily increase the heat and 
moisture to plants growing freely, and intro- 
duce another lot, removing any sufficiently 
advanced to the warmest part of the con- 
servatory. 

Gesneras, Gloxinias, &c. — Grow those in 
activity as vigorously as the season will allow ; 
and start a few more to keep up a succession. 

Sippeastrums, Crinums, Pancratiums, &c. 
— Encourage the development of any that may 
throw up their flower stalks by increased heat 
and moisture. 

Ipomceas. — Do nothing to excite any of 
these into growth at this dull season, but keep 
them cool and dry. 

Ixoras. — Keep the best plants in a state of 
rest ; one or two may be placed in heat and 
gradually advanced. 

Jasminums, Rondeletias, Brunfelsias. — 
Keep those growing freely which were intro- 
duced last month, and put in a succession. 

Lantanas. — Keep at rest and cool. If 
large specimens are wanted, some strong young 
plants may be started, and the shoots occa- 
sionally stopped to obtain a bushy plant. 

Luculia gratissima. — Do not encourage too 
free a growth in this plant yet; water spa- 
ringly. 

Lycopodiums must get no more water than 
necessary to keep them fresh and green. 

Malvaceous Plants, as hibiscus, should be 



536 



BOTANICAL TERMS. 



kept in a state of perfect rest for some time to 
come. 

Afanettias, and other tender climbers, should 
be kept in a cool, dry and airy place, and re- 
ceive only sufficient water to keep them from 
dying down. 

Melastomas. — See last month's directions, 
which may in this case be followed. 

Melo- Cacti must still be kept dry and in a 
free circulation of warm air; water only to 
prevent shrivelling. 

JMusas. — Guard against damp in the heart 
of the plant, and also against spots on the 
leaves, by keeping up a dry atmosphere. 

Nepenthes (Pitcher-plant). — Still maintain 
a warm and comparatively dry atmosphere 
about the plant. 

Neriwns. — Introduce more to the forcing 
house, and remove such as are forward enough 
to the conservatory. They require a liberal 
supply of water when growing. 

Nymphoeas (Water lilies).— Still keep the 
roots rather dry, and in a rather low tempera- 
ture. 

Palms. — Keep as previously directed. 

Thunbergias. — The perennial sorts should 
still be at rest, as any growth made now 
would only weaken the plants. 

Vincas. — A few may be placed in a warm 
house and their shoots be allowed to grow ; 
they will soon be in full flower. 

THE ORCHID HOUSE. 

Temperature. — The warm house for the 
Indian species 65 to 70 degrees by day, 55 to 
60 degrees at night; the cool, or Mexican 
house, 60 degrees by day, and 50 degrees at 
night. Rather lower than this in clear frosty 
weather. 

Ventilation. — Very little air can be ad- 
mitted to either of the houses now, and when 
air is given the ventilators ought to be covered 
with canvass, close wove wire, or similar ma- 
terial ; and they ought to be so placed that the 



cold air must pass over the pipes or othef 
heating apparatus. 

Watering. — Very little water will be re- 
quired about the plants ; steaming the houses 
in the morning when the weather is fair will 
be as much as will be necessary in that way. 
Plants in a growing state should be occa- 
sionally watered with great care, and always 
soon enough in the day to allow them to dry 
externally before the evening. 

Insects. — The same unremitting search 
after and destruction of all sorts of injurious 
vermin must be kept up. 

Potting. — Attend to this before any of the 
plants advance too far in their growth, as it 
can hardly be done at such a time without 
material damage to the roots. 

Soils. — Keep a sufficient stock in -doors in 
the dry to meet the demand ; never using any 
until it has acquired the temperature of the 
house in which it is to remain. 

Imported Plants should be treated as ad- 
vised last month. 

A'erides, Saccolabium, and Vanda. — Keep 
these in a state of rest, applying water very 
cautiously. 

Cymbidiums. — If rested for a time the 
slightest increase of heat and moisture is gene- 
rally sufficient to excite these plants to pro- 
duce their flowers, when they should receive 
an additional supply of water. 

Cattleyas. — Maintain these in a cool airy 
temperature, applying very little water until 
the flower spikes appear, when the heat and 
moisture must be increased. 

Dendrobiums.—Keep these in a state of 
rest, as before recommended. 

Oncidiums. — Continue these in a state of 
rest, being careful that no drip or other 
moisture lodges among the leaves. 

Stanhopeas. — A cool rest should be conti- 
nued to these until the season advances or 
until they show bloom, when the heat and 
moisture should be increased about them.

{Araucaria imbricata.) 



CONIFER^.— 

' Araucaria, Jussieu. Derived from Arau- 
cos, a name applied to the natives in those" 
districts of Chili where the tree is indigenous. 
— Noble evergreen trees. 

Araucaria imbricata, Pavon (imbricate- 
leaved Araucaria, or Chili Pine). — Leaves 
generally eight together, ovate lance-shaped, 
thickened at the base, stiff, straight, with per- 
sistent mucros. Cones globular at the end of 
the branches, about the size of a man's head ; 
scales beautifully imbricated. 

A very remarkable evergreen tree, of mag- 
nificent dimensions, almost the only one to be 
met with in those districts where it is indi- 
genous. It is a high tree, from 80 to 100 
feet, with a trunk like a pillar. Standing 
closely together in the forest, the trees are 
generally devoid of branches to the height of 
fifty or sixty feet : the top is in the shape of a 
depressed cone, the side-branches proceeding 
from the trunk in a horizontal direction, and 
ascending slightly at the tips. Over those 
branches the leaves are thickly set like scales, 
which give an appearance of rich embossed 
work. From the thick coating of leaves 
which pervades the whole outline of the tree, 
an idea of extreme brittleness is conveyed to 
the mind. The wood, however, was success- 
fully used in ship-building in 1780 by Don 
Francisco Dendariarena. 

This plant is a native of the mountainous 
parts of Chili, in South America, particularly 
in that division occupied by the tribes of original 



The Araucaria. 
inhabitants called Araucos, from whom the tree 
derives its name ; and from the fact that the 
climate where it thrives has accommodated 
itself so wonderfully to European productions, 
a hope may be held out that the Araucaria 
may in this country prove a valuable acqui- 
sition to the arboriculturist. The largest 
forests of this tree are on the elevated parts 
of Naguelbuta and Caramavida, which Pavon 
describes as " offering to the view, in general, 
a rocky soil, though in parts it is wet and 
boggy, on account of the abundance of rain 
and snow which falls in these regions, similar 
to many provinces in Spain." Pceppig, a 
traveller in the Peruvian Andes, states, that 
" the Araucaria forest of Antuco is the most 
northerly that is known in Chili ; so that the 
northern boundary of this king of all the 
extra-tropical American trees may be esti- 
mated at thirty- six degrees south latitude. 
The extreme southern limit is not so clearly 
ascertained ; which is not surprising when 
we consider how little, comparatively, is 
known of Western Patagonia : it seems pro- 
bable, however, that it does not stretch far 
beyond lat. forty-six degrees. Between An- 
tuco and Valdivia this tree only grows 
among the Andes, and, as the Indians assert, 
solely on their western declivities, and nowhere 
lower than from 1,500 feet to 2,000 feet 
below the snow line, up to which they fre- 
quently reach. Farther to the south, the 
Araucaria appears at a lower elevation ; and

in the country of the Cuncos, and about 
Osorno, is said, to occur on mountains of a 
very moderate altitude, near the sea. The Cor- 
eovado, a mountain that rises opposite Chiloe, 
is said to be studded, from its foot to the snow- 
line, with largegroups of these beautiful trees." 

The wood, as grown in the Andes, is of a yel- 
lowish white colour, veiny, and of close texture ; 
and is said to have been used in ship-building. 
The tree produces a whitish resin, used ex- 
tensively by the natives in the cure of wounds 
and contusions. The fruit may be said to 
form the regular harvest of several of the ori- 
ginal tribes, and it is eaten by them in a raw 
state, and after being boiled and roasted. 

The tree is particularly ornamental, and 
no plant can be used with greater effect in 
distinguishing particular spots of country ap- 
propriated to art. It should be on every gen- 
tleman's lawn : it is both elegant and unique ; 
and if sheltered during frosty weather, so as 
to keep off that rustiness of colour which a 
free exposure to the seasons brings with it, it 
will well repay the trouble in spring time. 

With regard to what is the best mode of pro- 
pagating this tree there is but one opinion — 
raising from seeds. Bottom heat is invariably 
recommended; and the seeds should be inserted 
to the depth of about an inch and a quarter, 
in large boxes or pans filled with free loamy 
soil, which should on no account be allowed 
to get dry. When two years old they should 
be transplanted into nursery lines, in a warm 
sheltered situation in the open ground, care- 
fully guarding them from excess of moisture, 
and, in frosty weather, from excess of cold. 
Those raised in hothouses, greenhouses, &c, 
certainly look better ; but when planted in 
their final situation, in exposed places, the 
former soon take the lead. Planted by the 
seaside in Norfolk, they have made shoots 
about a foot in length in one season. Plants 
nine inches high are 2s. each ; eighteen inches 
high 5s. each (1846). 

This tree has borne the names Araucaria 
Domheyi, Richard ; Colymbea quadrifaria, 
Salisbury ; and Dombeya chilensis, Lamarck. 

Araucaria Bidwilli, Hooker (Mr. Bid- 
will's Araucaria). — Leaves spreading, spirally 
arranged around the branches, ovate and 
pungently acuminate, three quarters of an 
inch long, and much dilated at the base. 
Cones (female) varying in shape from globu- 
lar to oval, nine inches long by seven inches 
broad ; scales loose, broad, winged, two-lipped, 
lower lip with a reflexed stiff spinous apex; 
(male) stout, cylindrical, four inches long ; 
scales oblong, compact. Seeds obovate, two or 
two and a half inches long, and three quarters 
of an inch broad. 

A very striking and noble evergreen-tree, 
of remarkable dimensions, growing in its 



native haunts from 100 to 150 feet high, 
with a stout trunk which scarcely tapers for 
one-half of its length, and is covered with a 
smooth blackish bark. Mr. Bidwill, its dis- 
coverer, describes these full-grown trees as 
very striking objects ; the dead brances com- 
mence about half-way up the stem, and con- 
tinue nearly to the summit, where the live 
branches are produced, about sixteen in a 
whorl. This bare-stemmed habit is induced 
by the crowded position occupied by the trees 
in the depths of the forests ; indeed, Mr. 
Bidwill states that there are no live branches 
except on those parts which rise above the 
surrounding trees : this part of the trees 
forms a very obtusely conical, almost globular 
head, the branches being densely crowded. 
Around these branches the leaves are closely 
arranged in an imbricated form, as in A. im- 
bricata, which indeed, in this respect, it a 
good deal resembles, only in the present plant 
the leaves spread out, often nearly at right 
angles; they are of a remarkably hard and 
rigid texture, slightly concave above, a little 
convex beneath, and generally marked or 
impressed with two lines, from the close 
application of the lower leaves in the infant 
state ; they are dark green and glossy, averag- 
ing rather more than three quarters of an inch 
long, but, occasionally, on the young branches, 
twice that length : on the younger and ter- 
minal branches the leaves appear crowded, 
but the dilated base is there recognisable ; 
and as the branches enlarge by age, this cha- 
racter becomes more and more apparent ; at 
length remarkably so, the diameter of the 
flattened dilated base equalling the length of 
the leaf, which takes a transversely hexagonal 
form. Thus on the older branches the leaves 
resemble a series of flattened hexagonal scales, 
with a leafy spine projecting from the centre. 
The cones are produced on the topmost 
branches, close to the central stem, rarely 
more than ten or twelve in number ; they 
grow upright, seated on short leafy branchlets 
arising from the horizontal main branches. 
Both in size and form, Mr. Bidwill describes 
them as varying considerably ; sometimes they 
are spherical, sometimes pear-shaped, with 
the small end downwards, and sometimes 
nearly oval ; but in all cases the scales are 
large, loosely compacted, and spreading, the 
majority of them nearly horizontal, about four 
inches long by three inches broad. These 
scales, when seen lying in their natural posi- 
tion, present each a thickened face to the 
spectator, tapering to an edge or wing on 
each side, and towards the apex becoming 
acuminated, with a recurved spinous point, 
and on the upper side another smaller scale 
or point, with which this is incorporated 
below ; these reflexed points are so stiff and

pungent, that the fruit in a perfect state is 
hard to lift, even with thick gloves on the 
hands ; the mass of the scales, however, is a 
soft pulpy substance, enclosing the seed, and 
this part soon decays, and on being torn open 
the seeds, of a very large size, fall out, black- 
ened by their contact with the decaying pulpy 
matter. The male cones are about four inches 
long, stout, cylindrical, apparently growing at 
the end of short leafy branches ; they are 
composed of a large number of closely imbri- 
cated spirally arranged oblong scales, present- 
ing each a convex apex, and having an in- 
curved point. 

This noble tree inhabits the Mount Bris- 
bane range of hills, seventy miles N. W. of 
Moreton Bay, in Australia. It was first 
introduced to this country in a living state 
by Mr. Bidwill himself, in 1843, and is, of 
course, yet very rare. "Whether or not it will 
prove at all hardy in our climate remains to 
be ascertained, and at present there is little 
prospect of the experiment having a fair 
trial. The probability to be deduced from 
its hilly habitat, is not against but rather in 
favour of its being suitable to our climate ; 
in order to this, however, the seeds should be 
collected from the highest points where it is 
found, and the plants raised from them 
planted out without being submitted to any 
of that pampering treatment which usually 
falls to the lot of scarce plants. At pre- 
sent, however, it is considered somewhat 
tender ; and we believe most of the plants 
which exist in the country have been raised 
either by cuttings or by the fashionable but 
repudiable process of grafting, which is entirely 
destructive of the characteristic habits of co- 
niferous plants, and in most cases sadly limits 
their existence and capabilities. The species is at 
least as hardy as those which immediately follow. 

The native name of this tree is Banza 
tunza, or Banya tunya. The seeds are 
extensively collected by the natives about the 
neighbourhood of Moreton Bay, and are used 
as food. The fruit, it is said, ripens only 
once in three years, and the precise period of 
their ripening does not appear to be known 
to the aborigines, who visit the trees at 
different periods to mark how they advance. 
Before they become ripe the seeds are very 
sweet, but, as they approach maturity, they 
acquire the same bean-like flavour as those of 
the Chili Pine. The natives, however, 
greedily eat them at all times — before ripe- 
ness raw, and when ripe, roasted and 
pounded into cakes. 

The wood is stated to be very close grained, 
but Mr. Bidwill was certain that none had 
been cut down in the district where he found 
the tree. He had, however, seen the wood of 
a plant five inches through, and this strongly

resembled that of the Kawri (Bammara 
australis) but appeared to have a firmer and 
closer grain. According to Lavvson's cata- 
logue, plants of this species six inches high 
are charged 3/. 3s. each (1846). 

Araucaria braziliana, Richard (Brazilian 
Araucaria). — Leaves lanceolate, loose, thinner 
than those of A. imbricata, of a shining 
light green ; glaucous, and keeled under- 
neath, and concave on the upper side ; one 
and a half inch long, and a quarter of an 
inch broad. Cones compact, roundish-ovate, 
solitary on the tip of the branches ; scales 
thick, corky, compressed, armed with sharp 
recurved spines. 

A noble tree, about ninety feet high, intro- 
duced in 1819, not sufficiently hardy to stand 
the winters of this country in the . open air. 
In general appearance it resembles A. imbri- 
cata, though it is much more open and spread- 
ing ; its rate of growth, too, is more rapid ; 
but this may probably be accounted for by the 
fact that many of the specimens in England 
are, occasionally at least, encouraged by being 
kept in a hothouse. Many botanists at first 
considered it as identical with the preceding 
A. imbricata; but the cones, and especially 
the seeds, which have no winged appendages, 
indicate a distinctive difference. The disposi- 
tion of its branches, which are horizontal, and 
the whitish colour of its timber, also prove it 
to be quite distinct. Its native habitats are 
around the base of mountains in the province 
of Minas Geraes, on the banks of the river 
Paraibuna, and throughout Espiritu Santo. 
The seeds contain very little resinous matter, 
and are common in the market of Rio de 
Janeiro. In England the plant is propagated 
chiefly by cuttings, which are treated in every 
respect like those of heaths. At Dropmore, 
and in the Horticultural Society's garden, are 
the finest specimens in England ; but they 
have to be carefully protected from frost 
during the winter months. Plants two feet 
high are 10s. 6c/. each (1846). 

Araucaria excelsa, Aiton (lofty Araucaria, 
or Norfolk Island Pine). — Leaves long, 
slighty waved, narrow, and, when the tree is 
old, closely pressed to the branches, or bent 
inwards. Cones globular, on thick footstalks; 
scales thick, leathery, broader than in the fore- 
going. 

One of the most majestic trees in nature, a 
native of Norfolk Island and New Caledonia, 
and introduced into this country during the 
close of the last century. It reaches the 
height of 200 feet, and its extreme altitude 
has been found, in a few cases, to be about 
230 feet. Thus it is that in the first letters 
from those who emigrate from this country, 
reference is always made to the prodigious 
height and noble appearance of the forests and

woods formed of this tree. The circumfer- 
ence of the trunk of the highest trees is 
from twenty-eight feet to thirty feet near to 
the ground. According to Captain Hunter, 
the wood of this tree is short grained, spongy, 
and not by any means adapted for house-car- 
pentry or ship-building, though frequently 
used in the latter capacity. It is almost 
without turpentine, and hence it is not calcu- 
lated to resist decay for many years. The 
wood he represents to be so heavy that five 
trees out of six, when cut down, sank in 
water ; but that out of thirty-seven trees cut 
down for repairing a ship, twenty-seven of 
them were found defective. Captain Cook, 
however, represents the wood as white, close 
grained, tough, and light. " Turpentine," he 
says, " had exuded out of most of the trees, 
and the sun had inspissated it into a resin, 
which was found sticking to the trunks and 
lying about the roots." "Norfolk Island," 
says James Backhouse, " is about seven miles 
long and four broad. A small portion of its 
southern side is limestone ; to the east of this 
there is a still smaller portion of coarse, silice- 
ous sandstone. The remainder of the island 
is basaltic, and rises into hills, covered with 
grass and forest. The highest hill is Mount 
Pitt, which is on the north side of the island, 
and about 1,200 feet above the level of the 
sea. The upper portions of the valleys, and 
the higher parts of the hills, are covered with 
wood. The Norfolk Island Pine {A. excelsa) 
towers a hundred feet above the rest of the 
forest ; it also grows in clumps, and singly, 
on the grassy parts of the island, to the very 
verge, where its roots are washed by the sea 
in high tides. In figure this tree resembles 
the Norway Spruce, but the tiers of its 
branches are more distant. Its appearance is 
remarkably different, in its native soil, from 
what it is in the fine collection of trees at 
Kew, where it nevertheless exhibits many of 
its striking and beautiful features." — {Narra- 
tive, p. 251.) "We measured a Norfolk 
Island Pine twenty-three feet, and another 
twenty-seven feet in circumference. Some of 
them are nearly 200 feet high. The timber 
is not of good quality, but it is used in build- 
ing ; it soon perishes when exposed to the 
weather."— {Ibid. p. 265.) 

Like the other individuals belonging to the 
genus, this plant is highly ornamental, and 
peculiar in the mode of its growth. It should 



by all means be tried in quiet sunny spots 
surrounded by high woods, and sheltered 
sufficiently for a series of winters until twenty 
or thirty years old, when, in all probability, 
it might be gradually inured to the climate 
without close protection. This species is 
propagated both by seeds and cuttings : the 
former mode is to be recommended as pro- 
ducing the handsomer plants. Those four 
feet high are sold at 10Z. each ; plants one 
foot high are two guineas each (1846). 

Salisbury called this plant Eutassa hetero- 
phylla ; and it has been called Dombeya 
excelsa by Lambert, and also Altingia excelsa. 

Araucaria Cunninghamii, Aiton (Cun- 
ningham's Araucaria). — Leaves smooth, 
shining, straight, rigid, varying in form, two- 
rowed, awl-shaped, about half an inch long, 
keeled underneath. Cones resembling those 
of A. imbricata, ovate, terminal, solitary. 

A tall tree, though not by any means equal 
to the foregoing. It is found on the basaltic 
soils of the shores of Moreton Bay, within 
the influence of the sea air ; and, according 
to Backhouse, " further into the interior * it 
forms large woods." This writer observes 
that it is frequently associated with several 
species of Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Banksia, 
and Callitris arenosa, both at Moreton Bay, 
and in the neighbourhood of Brisbane, where 
it rises to the height of 120 feet. Its wood 
is of a pale yellowish colour, and is used for 
boat-building and common purposes at the 
above town. The finest specimens in England 
are at Dropmore and Kew ; but in every case, 
in this country, it requires close protection 
during winter. It is highly probable that, if 
planted within the influence of the sea air, it 
would stand a British climate with very little 
shelter. In order to propagate the species, 
the seeds should be imported in the cones, 
and treated like those of the A. imbricata, 
keeping the young plants in a greenhouse, 
instead of exposing them to the open air. 
Small plants are 10s. 6d. each (1846). 

Araucaria elegans, of gardens. — Not seen 
by the writer, but represented to be an elegant 
addition to the genus, and more worthy of 
attention on account of its being hardy. 
Plants, one foot high, 41. 4s. each, (1846). 

Araucaria gracilis, of gardens. — Another 
elegant plant, with small slender leaves, also 
hardy enough to stand the winter of Britain. 
Plants, one foot high, 41. 4s. each (1846). 



CONIFERiE.— The Cunninghamia. 



Cunninghamia, E. Brown. Named in 
honour of Mr. James Cunningham, the dis- 
coverer ; and of Mr. Allan Cunningham, an 
enterprising botanical explorator. — Evergreen

Cunninghamia sinensis, Richard (Chinese 
Cunninghamia). — Leaves proceeding at once 
from the branches, scattered in insertion, more

or less two ranked in direction, lanceolate, 
stiff, long pointed, about two inches in length. 
Cones without footstalks, globular, drooping, 
one inch and a quarter in length ; scales ovate, 
jagged on the margin. 

A small sized elegant evergreen tree, which, 
upon its first being discovered, gave rise 
to a great many doubts as to its proper 
place amongst the Coniferas. Hence it for 
a long time bore a great many synonyms, 
namely, Araucaria lanceolata, Pinus lan- 
ceolata, Abies major sinensis, &c. &c. — 
This tree was introduced from China at 
the commencement of the present century, 
and was generally kept in hot-houses and 
greenhouses ; but from more recent experi- 
ments there is no doubt left of its accommo- 
dating itself to an open air climate in this 
country. In the pleasure-ground at Clare- 
mont is a specimen 25 feet high. Another, 
at White Knights, which has never been pro- 
tected, is 30 feet high, forming a most elegant 
object ; and at Elvaston Castle, Mr. Barron, 
the gardener, has raised some beautiful plants 
from cuttings, a process which in this instance 
has been found to answer extremely well. 
The best way is to treat them like heaths, in 
a sharp soil containing a good mixture of sand, 
and subjecting them to a moderate bottom 



heat. The mode of compelling such plants 
to send out a leader is thus described by 
Mr. Stewart Murray, in Loudon's Gardener's 
Magazine. "In the Glasgow Botanic Garden, 
in 1825, were two plants, 2 feet or 3 feet high, 
struck from cuttings some years previously, 
the tops of which, though the trees were in 
very luxuriant health, still retained the appear- 
ance of a branch, which, even when tied up 
to a stake, always seemed as if endeavouring 
to regain its horizontal position. During the 
winter of 1825, I loosened the top of one from 
its stake, and fastened it down quite in a 
horizontal direction ; in about six weeks 
afterwards, a very vigorous shoot made its 
appearance from below the surface of the 
earth in the pot. When this shoot had attained 
the height of eight or nine inches, I cut away 
the old top entirely, and at this time (1827) 
the centre shoot produced is nearly 2 feet 
high." The same experiment has been suc- 
cessfully practised on this, as well as on other 
plants, by different individuals, in various 
localities. Small plants, in pots, Is. 6d. each ; 
those 1 foot in height, 3s. 6d. each (1846). 

Variety. C. sinensis glanca, — A beautiful 
variety with slightly glaucous leaves, growing 
as freely as the species. Plants, 1 foot, 7s. 6d. 
each (1846). 



CONIFER^.— The Dammara. 



Dammara, from Dammar, the name given 
by the inhabitants of Amboyna to the resin 
which the tree produces. — Evergreen trees. 

Dammara orientalis, Lambert (oriental 
Dammar Pine). — Leaves nearly opposite, 
entire, of alight glaucous green, oblong, lanceo- 
late, 1 1 inch long, and § inch in width. Cones 
ovate, with adpressed scales rounded at the top. 

A tall and beautiful broad-leaved evergreen 
tree, nearly akin to the Araucaria, flourishing 
on the summits of the mountains in one of the 
loveliest islands in the Indian Ocean. It is 
brought down to garnish the trim hamlets 
with which Amboyna is studded, and occupies 
a conspicuous place among the famous hard 
woods of that country. It was introduced 
into England in 1804 by Sir Joseph Banks, 
and has ever since been admired for its richly 
garnished branchlets and elegant habit. The 
wood of the tree somewhat resembles that of 
the cedar, and is represented to be light and 
of inferior quality, and consequently unfit to 
resist continued exposure to the atmosphere. 
The chief use of the tree consists in the resin 
which it yields, which is of a pure crystal- 
like colour, and which, after incisions are made, 
hangs like icicles from the trunk. The cones 
are imported from New Zealand, and the 
seeds sown in pure loam in pans placed in a 
stove. They should be covered to the depth 
of half an inch ; and when fairly up, they 



should be gradually inured to the cold, until 
they are placed in a warm sheltered sunny 
spot in the open ground. The probability is, 
that this species will prove hardy enough for 
the climate of England. [?] Plants, 6 to 9 
inches, are 15s. each ; and those 2 feet high 
are £3 3s. each (1846). 

Dammara aastralis, Lambert j (southern 
Dammar Pine). — Leaves sessile, crowded, 
rigid, somewhat wavy, shining like those of the 
box-tree, much broader at the base than those 
of the foregoing species. Cones turbinate, 
terminal, erect, tapering towards a thick 
footstalk, which gives them an appearance 
of being top-shaped. 

A lofty tree, discovered by Cook in 1769, 
and growing plentifully on the banks of the 
river which traverses the interior of the Bay 
of Islands, named by Mr. Marsden the 
Gambier ; also on that smaller river called the 
Thames, by Captain Cook. But, though 
abundant in the valleys, it ascends to the sides 
and tops of the mountains, and there towers 
far above the other gigantic trees with which 
it is associated, its trunk being bare and 
straight to the height of seventy feet, and " 
top dense and leafy. In a few instar 
clean columnar trunks have been found 
out a single branch 100 feet in length 
excellence of the wood of this pine is 
beyond a question ; for according to Lambei^

when it was tested along with the Riga pine, 
the result was as follows : — "Both pines were 
l|r inch square, 3 feet long, and suspended 
10 inches from the end. The D. australis 
bore a weight of 1 cwt. 2 qr. and 151bs. before 
it broke, and the Riga pine only 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 
and lib. ; but the former weighed lib. and 
13 oz., while the latter weighed only lib. and 
8 oz. This tree, like the other, yields a 
glassy transparent resin, which hardens by 
exposure to the air, and which is found to 
answer admirably as varnish. The seeds 
should be sown in pans of loam in a stove, 
and gradually shifted to a colder situation. 
If the cones were gathered from such of the 
trees as stand on the tops of the mountains, 
there is little doubt that the young plants 
might be grown in a greenhouse, and finally 
inured to warm situations in the open air. 
All experience with half-hardy plants goes 
to confirm this theory. Plants 18 inches 
high are 15s. each (1846), 



The foregoing paper completes the series 
relating to the true cone-bearing plants (po- 
pularly so considered) comprising the tribe 
Abietinas. The other tribe of coniferous 
plants — Cupressinae, whose fruit has been dis- 
tinguished by the term galbulus, will be treated 
on in the succeeding volume ; it will include 
the arbor- vitae, the cypress, the juniper, and 
one or two smaller genera. 

The genera forming the tribe Abietinas 
just completed, all of which are included in 
the present volume, are : — Pinus (pp. 77,

of Veronica are known, though not yet intro- 
duced to our gardens. Of two of these, most 
beautiful figures are given in Dr. Hooker's 
Flora Antarctica. The species now specially 
referred to are V. Benthanii(Bentham's Speed- 
well) and V. odora (sweet-scented Speedwell). 
Veronica Benthami is an erect branching 
shrub, growing from two to four feet high. 
The branches are spreading, and clothed with 
decussate (cross-wise) sessile leaves, varying 
in figure from oblong to oblong-obovate and 
linear-oblong. The flowers grow in erect, 



VERONICAS. 

| leafy, terminal racemes, and are of an intense 
azure colour, with violet-coloured veins. It 
is not only a beautiful, but a very remarkable 
plant, and one of the greatest ornaments of the 
barren hills it inhabits. The flowers are 
nearly as large as those of V. elliptica ( V. de- 
cussata), that is, about five or six lines in 
diameter. They are of a beautiful blue colour. 
This plant was found abundantly on rocky 
places on the hills both in Lord Auckland's 
and in Campbell's Islands. Haubron and 
Jacquinot, in a French work called Voyage 
au Pole 8ud, names the plant Veronicajinaus-

trina. The species, however, well deserves 
to commemorate Mr. Bentham, who has very 
successfully laboured in the family to which it 
belongs. 

Veronica odora is also a shrubby species, of 
elegant appearance, but much more slender in 
its growth than the former. Its slender 
branches have a peculiarly upright, somewhat 
fastigiate habit. The leaves are of very equal 
size and figure, elliptic-ovate, and they are 
very precisely arranged in the decussate form. 
The flowers are small and white, and grow at 
the ends of the shoots in crowded sub- capitate 
racemes. They are very sweet scented ; in- 
deed the species is more remarkable for the 
delicious fragrance of its flowers, resembling 
that of the jasmine, than for any special beauty 
of appearance. It is found in the form of scat- 
tered bushes, in woods near the sea, on Lord 
Auckland's group of islands. 




Veronica odora. 

Besides these,- the Veronica elliptica (V. 
clecussata), a shrubby species long known in 
our gardens, is found abundantly near the sea, 
both in Campbell's and in Lord Auckland's 
Islands. Dr. Hooker remarks : " I saw but 
one specimen in full flower, growing on an 
inaccessible rock overlooking Rendezvous 
Harbour. From a distance it seemed powdered 
with white flowers." 

In New Zealand this genus is one of the 
most extensive of flowering plants, containing 
upwards of two dozen species, of which four- 
fifths are shrubby or arborescent. One or two 
very handsome ones of this habit are already 
introduced to our gardens, such as V. speciosa, 
with deep purple flowers, and very broad ob- 
tuse leaves ; V. elliptica, seldom seen well 
grown, but then really beautiful, with white 



flowers, and small neat elliptic leaves ; and 
V. salicifolia, with lance- shaped leaves, and 
long drooping spikes of French- white flowers. 
These species do best in a cool greenhouse, 
if they are grown in pots. In some sheltered 
situations, and in mild winters, V. elliptica has 
stood out uninjured (and most probably the 
others here mentioned would also do so), but 
it will not do this in ordinary seasons. They 
may most properly be ranked as half-hardy 
plants, and would flourish to perfection in 
some of those glass structures without artificial 
heat, which we may now hope to see erected 
very extensively for the purpose of growing 
the numerous plants of sterling beauty which 
will hardly survive our climate unprotected. 
They grow very readily in a soil composed of 
three parts turfy loam, and one part peat 
earth, lightened with sand and leaf mould ; 
and all propagate freely from cuttings. 

NEW BRITISH PLANTS. 

The following additions to the Flora of this 
country have been announced during the past 
year. Some of the plants appear to have been 
detected earlier, but the facts were not made 
public until the present season. We have 
made our notices of them brief, and have put 
them into the form most likely to be useful ; 
that is to say, we have appended to each plant 
a brief botanical character, as published in the 
various foreign botanical works where the 
plants have been described. The books 
which are professedly devoted to the descrip- 
tion of the species inhabiting this country, are 
of course, at present, deficient as regards these 
recent additions ; the specific definitions we 
have given, will therefore be useful to those 
who are interested in British Botany, but who 
have not access to a botanical library. 

Carex argyroglochia ( Hornemann ). — 
" Spikes oblong distichous ; spikelets 4 to 6, 
alternate, obovate ; fruit ovate, acuminate, 
glabrous, as long as the silvery glume ; beak 
bifid ; bracts longer than^the spikelets." Spikes 
two or three approximate : glumes oblong, 
rather acute : perennial. Near C. ovalis ; dif- 
fering in its long foliaceous bracts. A plant 
with this character was found by Mr. West- 
combe, near Malvern, Worcestershire. 

Gli/ceria hyorida (Townsend). — Closely 
allied to G. plicata and G.fiuitans. Found 
by Mr. Townsend at Doveclale, Gloucester- 
shire. 

Hieracium heteropkyllum (Bladon). ■ — 
" Leaves all sessile, cauline, lowest lanceolate, 
upper ovate acuminate." — Stem 1 to 3 J feet 
high, clothed with slender silky hairs, spring- 
ing from an oblong glandular base. Leaves 
all cauline, the base not truly clasping. Flowers 
size and colour of those of macufatum ; scales 
of the involucre attenuated towards the point,

and, as well as peduncles covered, with hairs, 
as on the stem ; bracteas ovate-acuminate ; 
seeds longitudinally ribbed. Perennial ? — 
Flowers in August and September. Allied to 
H. murorum and II. maculatum. Found by- 
Mr. J. Bladon of Pont-y-pool, growing in 
woods and hedge banks ; very rarely in open 
ground. 

Linaria siipina (Desfontaines). — This plant, 
described by Mr. Babington, in llanual of 
jBritisk Botany, as a true native, found at 
Catdown quarries, Plymouth, by Mr. Keys, is 
ascertained to be an accidental introduction, 
now becoming naturalized. 

3Ialva vertlcillata (Linn.) — " Stem erect ; 
leaves cordate, rather orbicular, bluntly angu- 
lar; flowers axillary, glomerate, sessile; calyxes 
scabrous, rather inflated ; carpels smoothish." 
Stem one to two feet. Flowers small, white, 
purplish at the tip, almost sessile. Annual. 
Flowers in June and July. (China : intro- 
duced to gardens in 1683.) A plant very 
nearly allied to M. crisjm, of which it is pos- 
sibly the type, has been determined (with but 
slight doubt) to be this species. Found by 
Mr. J. Motley, in corn-fields at Llanelly, 
Glamorganshire, in 1845; plentifully in three 
fields. Not indigenous. 

PJudaris paradoxa (Linna?us). — " Panicle 
subspicate, cylindrical ; glumes of perfect 
flowers acuminate, of rudimentary flowers pra> 
morse." Intermediate flowers hermaphrodite, 
the rest imperfect. Annual. Flowers in July. 
This plant was found by Mr. J. Hussey, in 
July 1847, in a field near Swanage, Dorset- 
shire. Reported as P. utriculata in London 
Journal of Botany, but determined by Mr. 
H. C. Watson to be P. paradoxa. 

Poly gala depressa (Wenderoth). — " Stems 
depressed, filiform, branched, leafy ; lower 
leaves mostly crowded, oblong or obovate- 
elliptical, obtuse, upper leaves lanceolate, scat- 
tei-ed ; racemes short, few flowered ; flowers 
crested, lateral sepals (wings) oblong-obovate, 
their lateral nerves reticulate, anastomosing 
with an oblique branch of the central nerve." 
Perennial. Flowers in May and June. Very 
near P. vulgaris and P. amara. Found by 
Dr. Bromfield on Bleak Down, Isle of Wight, 
in May 1 846. It agrees also with P. serpyl- 
lacea (Weihe). 

Pyrola maritima (Kenyon). — Probably a 
variety of P. rotund/folia, distinguished by 
its size, the form and length of the sepals, and 
length of the stamens. Found by Mr. Kenyon 
in Lancashire. 

Simethis bicolor (Kunth). — Anthericum pla- 
nifolium (Vandelli). — "Leaves flat; filaments 
woolly." Roots fascicled, club-shaped ; stem 
one foot, erect, terminated by a many-flowered 
corymbose raceme ; leaves radical, grass-like, 
subcarinate ; flowers solitary, erect, on long 



pedicels, white tinged with purple externally ; 
pedicels with a bract at the base. Perennial. 
Flowers in July. The Anther icicm planifolium, 
and Bulbine planifolia of older authors, found 
by Miss C. Wilkins growing amongst heath 
and furze in a fir plantation about two miles 
from Bourne, in July 1847. 

HOVEA CELSII, AND ITS CULTURE. 

Thejre is no plant so well repays the 
extraordinary care required in counteracting 
its bad habit as Hovea Celsii. Its brilliant blue 
butterfly-shaped flowers, closely investing its 
stem, and set off by the protruding green leaves, 
form an object of peculiar interest, and it 
requires no little pains and skill to overcome 
its natural tendency to lanky and uncouth 
growth. There are several points to which 
the cultivator must direct his attention, but 
which are lost sight of by the ordinary gar- 
dener. The plant grows rapidly and long 
in its shoots ; and we once saw one of the 
most beautiful dwarf plants — as it appeared to 
the casual observer — win a prize against a much 
better grown specimen, and the judges were 
duped by what in some cases would be called 
a fraud. The dwarf plant was the head of a 
tall gauky standard, and the stem had been 
coiled round the inside of a large pot, and so 
pegged down as to leave nothing but the head 
above the soil ; and this fraud succeeded in con- 
sequence of the judges being ignorant of its 
nature, and the handsome appearance of the 
plant, while common gardeners, who pretended 
to no particular knowledge of plants, had their 
suspicions awakened by the extraordinary 
dwarfness of a plant hitherto seen only on a 
long stem. They did not look for a stem 
pegged down round a pot, and the head 
turned up in the centre ; they searched, ex- 
pecting to find that it was the head of a plant 
stuck into a pot : deception they knew there 
must be, but the nature of it was only discerned 
in seeking for another kind of fraud. How- 
ever, ugly as is the natural growth of the 
Hovea, its habit is to be conquered, and its 
growth controlled. We begin with a struck 
cutting, which we will pot into the size called 
sixty, perhaps two and a half to three inches 
across, in soil composed of the loam of rotted 
turves two parts, peat-earth one part, no dung 
of any kind, there being sufficient vegetable 
mould to answer all the purposes of richness 
in rotted turves, such as are taken from a pas- 
ture to lay down for lawns. In this compost, 
rubbed through a coarse sieve, is the cutting 
to be placed in the centre of the pot, which 
must be well drained with coarse moss or 
crocks. We shall presume the cutting to be 
two inches above the soil, which should only 
j ust cover the upper part of the root. As soon 
as the top of the cutting moves, to show it is

establishing the root, pinch out the top. Let 
the pot stand in a heath pit, close to the glass, 
in the most airy part of the greenhouse, 
shaded from the blazing heat of the sun, and 
be entirely uncovered in mild cloudy weather. 
All the air that can be given, should be given ; 
the object is to grow the plant slowly, for 
with rapid growth in exciting soil, such as 
the one -shift madmen recommended, the 
leaves would be far apart, and the most con- 
summate skill would fail to make a handsome 
plant. The cutting, or rather the plant, will 
soon throw out lateral branches. 

The soil must not be kept too moist, and 
the drainage must be occasionally examined, 
for a stoppage of that would subject a slow 
growing plant to disease, and that would soon 
produce the enemies which hasten a plant's 
destruction. The plant must not be exposed, 
therefore, to cold or parching winds that 
would check it, nor must it be excluded from 
free air, lest it should be drawn. The lateral 
branches will soon be two or three inches 
long, when the ends must be also pinched out 
of them. In the due course these lateral 
branches throw out others, and such of these 
as grow in a position to help to form a handsome 
bush, may be allowed to go on ; but such as 
grow inwards or across others, or only lead 
by their positions to thicken the plant, must 
be taken away. If the plant assumes a hand- 
some bush-like form, and continues to do so as 
the young branches advance, you may use 
your own pleasure as to allowing it to bloom 
or not. If you look more to future than to 
present growth, the incipient bloom may be 
all picked off as fast as the buds show them- 
selves, and the branches will be inclined to 
ramble on directly, but at the same time that 
the buds are picked off, the ends of the 
bi'anches must be taken off, and side branches 
will be thrown out that will require some dis- 
crimination in choosing which shall grow, and 
which require to be taken away. But as the 
Hovea is very beautiful when blooming ever 
so young, it is better to let it flower the 
firstj time it produces flower buds ; and the 
instant the branches move to elongate, which 
they do while the flowers are in perfection, 
stop them by pinching out the young growth at 
once. It is well to remove the flowers as they 
decay, instead of allowing the plant to seed, 
because that really tries a plant more than 
any thing. All this time we have said no- 
thing about shifting. Let not any season or 
period rule this ; occasionally examine the 
plants by turning out one of the balls, and 
when the roots have reached the side and begin 
to run round it, change the pot before the 
fibres mat together : change only to one size 
larger, that is, from sixty to forty-eight, from 
forty-eight to thirty -two, thence to twenty -four, 



sixteen, twelve, and eight. Every time it 
blooms and the ends are taken off to make the 
plant send out fresh branches, remember to 
select those which are growing right, and rub 
off such as are likely to grow wrong ; the head 
must be kept open and handsome. The young 
wood bears the flowers, and you must have an 
eye to this in selecting the shoots that are to 
grow, and removing those which are not. The 
slowness of the growth causes the foliage to 
be closer, the flowers more abundant, the 
plant more bushy and effective. So long as it 
is carefully stopped, and pruned with as much 
care as a choice peach or nectarine tree, and 
grown in healthy but not rich soil, so long 
will the plant do the grower credit and not 
become naked. To grow these plants as a 
standard, it is almost enough to let them alone, 
for they are not disposed to send out lateral 
shoots in abundance without stopping, and 
when they do, they ought only to be rubbed 
off the lower half the stem. As the tree grows 
up the leader must be preserved, and if there 
is any thing like a fork or a strong branch 
comes out near the top, it must be instantly 
taken away. By continually removing the lower 
branches, so as to keep the stem clear half the 
length of the tree and not higher, the stem 
grows strong enough to support the head, and 
when the tree is as high as you wish it, re- 
move the lower branches, leaving only four or 
five of those nearest the top, each of which is 
to be shortened to half a dozen eyes and the 
top pinched out. When these push out their 
lateral branches, rub off all the buds that 
show inwards, and let all those grow that are 
outwards. See, however, that none cross 
each other, and as all have a tendency to grow 
upwards, tie them down so as to show out hori- 
zontally, pointing all round the tree ; as these 
are to form the head, and are wanted perma- 
nently, place them pointing outwards, in the 
direction that most equally divides the whole 
space round the head, and those above require 
quite as much adjusting as the lower ones. 
If, however, they grow in a handsome form, 
let them show their bloom, and if any branches 
have not grown enough for your taste, 
let them shoot the length before you stop 
them, but generally take out the tops of all 
the branches the instant they attempt to make 
fresh growth, and be as careful of the lateral 
shoots as possible, allowing all to grow that 
can contribute to the beauty of the head, and 
stopping all those which would merely crowd 
the centre. The branches held down hori- 
zontally will after a time be set in that 
position, and the weight of the other branches 
will assist in making them permanently so. 
By this means, and such steps as the skill of 
the gardener may suggest, as difficulties or 
occasions arise, the Hovea, either as a standard 



552 



CAMPANULA FRAGILIS. 



or a bush, may be made one of the most 
beautiful of greenhouse plants. We need 
hardly mention, that when the plants are too 
large for the heath pit, they may be moved to 
the heath house, greenhouse, or conservatory. 
The gardener must, however, bear in mind 
that there never was a more wild notion, than 
that the quick growth of plants displayed 
skill. There is no art in promoting rapid 
growth : it is as easy as growing orehideous 
plants, and this is easy enough, every gardener 
who has grown them knows ; there is less 
room for blundering in it than in any other 
race of plants we know. Exciting soil, plenty 
of it, heat and moisture, will produce a plant 
in one season as large as ordinary treatment 
will produce in three, — but is it worth more ? 
Yes, as a nursery plant to cut up, it is, because 
it may be valued by the yard, or the quan- 
tity of plants it will propagate ; but in a 
gentleman's place such a plant would not be 
worth so much as one of slow growth the 
same age. But there does require great skill 
to grow a plant slowly and keep it in health, 
and those who can accomplish it leave behind 
them, in point of scientific display, all those who 
boast of their rapid cultivation. A man who 
really knows his business must feel disgusted 
at the great rambling specimens of Fuchsia, 
Epacris, Chorozema, and many other subjects, 
with leaves three times as far distant as they 
ought to be, exposing bare stalks and blooms 
equally distant in proportion. We have seen 
at public exhibitions scores of plants which 
were a discredit to the growers' judgment 
and skill, fitted only for the vulgar taste of 
those who value every thing by quantity, and 
indicative of a low mind and bad instruc- 
tions. If those gardeners who pride themselves 
upon being able to grow a thing quicker and 
larger than any one else, had a grain of taste, 
they would look at what a plant is capable of 
being made in the way of symmetry and beauty, 
and would study proportion a little ; we should 
not then see the tables that ought to be occu- 
pied by elegance and beauty, covered with 
specimens which betray utter ignorance of 
what a plant should be to be perfection. 

G-. 

CAMPANULA FRAGILIS. 

(Cyrilli.) 

THE SKITTLE BELL-FLOW r ETC. 

This species is properly a dry-frame plant, 
but it is often met with as a hardy greenhouse 
herbaceous plant, being perhaps more easily 
and safely preserved on the shelves of a green- 
house—where there is such a convenience — 
than in a frame where the latter is confined 
and at all damp. It, however, by no means 
requires the warmth of a greenhouse ; and a 
common frame, with a dry bottom and well 



ventilated, will keep it safe in winter ; in sum- 
mer it of course may stand exposed. 

It forms a diffuse branching plant, of about 
six inches high, and from a foot to a foot and 
a half over. The plant in a barren state forms 
a thick stem with a tuft of leaves, which are 
roundish-heart-shaped, and bluntly crenate- 
lobed, and grow on long stalks ; from this part 
the spreading flowering stems are thrown out, 
and these bear smaller, ovate leaves, all the 
leaves being of a bluish green and quite smooth. 
The flowers are large for the size of the plant, 
pale blue, and very numerous, terminating the 
branches in a kind of racemose panicle. It is 
a native of Italy, and other parts of the south 
of Europe, and is recorded to have been intro- 
duced to our gardens about 1826. The flowers 
are usually borne in the height of summer. It 
has borne the followinsr names : — C. diffusa 
(Vahl) ; C. cocldearifolia (Vahl) ; and C. 
crassifolia (Nees). The plant represented in 



%£M>t0^ /mm 




the above engraving is a variety of this 
species, and is usually called C. fragilis var. 
kirsuta. Tenore however calls it C. fragilis 
var. lanuginosa, the two names having nearly 
the same meauing, and referring to the only 
particular in which it differs from the species, 
namely, in the plant being entirely hispid in- 
stead of smooth, that is to say, covered, as it 
were, with short hair-like woolliness. 

It is easily cultivated. Large tufts are 
most effective, so that it should rather be 
allowed to grow on to that state, than con- 
stantly divided to make small plants. For 
this purpose nothing is necessary but to shift 
it two or three times during the spring and 
summer, until it is placed, say in a nine-inch 
pot : when it has reached this size it would be 
inconvenient to increase the size of the pot, so 
that then, after flowering, it should be turned 
out, the ball reduced, and then the old plant 
repotted into a smaller pot — as small as con- 
venient — very much after the way in which 



THE GARDENIA, AND ITS CULTURE. 



553 



Pelargoniums are treated ; it may then be 
again shifted on for flowering when it gets 
established. A light loamy soil suits it ; and 
it may be increased by planting any little 
offshoots that can be obtained as cuttings. In 
summer it may stand with other choice half- 
hardy pot plants ; and in winter may be placed 
in a dry frame or greenhouse, as may be most 
convenient. 

THE GARDENIA, AND ITS CULTURE. 

There is no plant that we are aware of 
more fragrant, more handsome in its growth, 
or more easily cultivated than the Gardenia. 
There are several varieties, but G. radicans and 
G. florida appear the most popular and of the 
simplest culture. The flowers are white, dou- 
ble, full, somewhat ragged, but fragrant beyond 
measure. The plants grow well in a mixture, 
which we observe quoted in the Gardener's 
Almanack as a universal compost, and it is 
very nearly so. It consists of the loam in 
which the turf has been rotted, peat earth 
of the kind so generally used for heaths, cow- 
dung, and a little silver sand, the quantity to be 
varied as the compost may require to prevent 
its being too adhesive. It should be potted 
first in small pots and shifted as it grows. 
When you desire to propagate it you should 
select shoots of the last year's growth, or 
rather of the latest growth, which may be two 
or three inches long; take these off and cut up 
to a joint, remove two or three of the lower 
leaves, so as to leave nearly an inch to go into 
the soil; then take a wide-mouthed pot, and fill 
it first one-third with crocks for drainage, and 
then within half an inch of the top with the 
soil, let the bottom be struck two or three 
times on the potting bench, to settle it down a 
little and level the surface. Fill the pot up 
with silver sand even with the edge of the 
pot, and then, with a very fine rose that will 
not displace the sand, water it with soft water, 
so that the sand may be saturated and the soil 
be fairly wetted through. Now take a bell 
glass that will nearly reach the edge of the 
pot, and press it on the sand so as to make a 
mark. Take the cuttings one by one, and 
put them into the sand, so that the bottom 
of the cutting may reach the compost, but not 
go into it ; a slight sprinkle of water over the 
foliage, and to settle the sand close about the 
stems, completes the setting, and the glass 
may be put on and placed in a common hot- 
bed, with a slight heat, or, which is handier, 
better, and requires less care, plunged into 
the tan in a propagating house, there being 
required a slight bottom heat. A shade of 
paper should be placed over the glass, to keep 
off the rays of the sun. Every morning the 
glass should be wiped dry and then replaced. 



The hot-bed will do just as well if the heat 
has sufficiently declined, but cai*e must be 
taken to keep the temperature down. The best 
times to take the cuttings are when the shoots 
have made about two inches of growth, or else 
when the plant has set for bloom, and shows 
the difference between the blooming ones and 
those that will not, and this should be the 
guide in preference to any stated period, for 
with slight bottom heat, constant watching, 
regularly wiping the glasses, and watering 
the cuttings when they lack moisture, the 
plant strikes easily and in a moderately short 
time. If any of the cuttings when they begin 
to grow set for bloom, which is a common 
occurrence, the bud should be picked off, as it 
greatly checks the growth of so small a plant ; 
but if that be not an object, a well rooted 
cutting will perfect the bloom well enough. 
In a few weeks after the cuttings are inserted 
they will be found well rooted, and they must 
then be potted off: they may be first potted in 
large sixty-sized pots, in the same sort of 
compost they were rooted in. Prepare the 
pot by putting an inch of crocks at the bot- 
tom, or if it be plentiful you may fill one- 
third of the pot with clean but coarse moss, 
and then one-third more of compost ; this 
leaves a third to be filled. Strike the pot 
of cuttings on its side gently, so as to disturb 
the soil a little, and then with a piece of stick 
like the blade of a blunt knife thrust in close 
to the side where the compost is disturbed, and 
raise up the earth and cuttings together. Sepa- 
rate them carefully without breaking the roots, 
and holding one upright in the centre of the 
pot, fill up with the soil, pressing and adjust- 
ing the cutting, so that the soil shall come up 
to the under leaves, and the pots be full of the 
compost. Do this with the whole of them, then 
place them all in a slight hot-bed, water with 
a fine rose all over the foliage, and with soft 
water of the temperature of the bed, suffi- 
ciently to settle the earth about the roots, 
shut them down close and shade them ; in a 
few hours give them a little air, but not to 
let in wind ; see now that they are kept moist 
until they are well established ; when they 
have begun to grow give them air rather 
more freely, and always shade them from the 
hottest rays of the sun. One half the plants 
may now be topped, that is, the heart pinched 
out, to form the growth of lateral branches, 
and promote bushy growth, but the other 
half may be allowed to grow their own way, 
as the plant is inclined to grow handsome 
without any assistance. This, however, makes 
two very distinct kinds of plant, and you may 
keep them both growing until the pots are 
filled with roots but not matted ; you may 
now prepare to shift them into pots of the size 
forty-eight, by filling them with one-third 



554 



NEW GARDEN FRUITS. 



crocks, then a little compost ; then take the 
ball of earth out whole, without disturbing, 
by tapping the edge of the pot in which they 
are growing, and place the ball whole in the 
larger pot, tilling all round it with the same 
kind of soil, and gently pressing it dowm be- 
tween the ball and the side of the new pot ; 
regulate them nicely, and water with tepid 
water to settle the earth to the balls. These 
may be placed in a hot-bed again, made with 
dung in preference to any other, the heat 
having declined a little and being kept up 
moderately by linings when it is going too 
low. Here they will continue to grow and 
make wood. If they show bloom, use your 
own pleasure as to letting them flower or 
not, remembering that if they bloom they 
do not grow so fast. If any of the branches 
are inclined to grow too long or are too vigo- 
rous for the rest of the plant, take the heart 
out or a piece off, so as to keep the plants in | 
shape ; and if the lateral branches altogether | 
are growing too long, pinch out the ends that j 
they may still send out more. In this way 
continue to grow for size or for bloom, as you 
may fancy or require, and shift from one sized j 
pot to another as the pots fill with roots, until i 
the plant is as large as you wish ; you have 
then only to let them flower when they will. 
"When the plants have made the season's wood 
it will be well to let them be kept rather more 
dry, but gentle moist heat is their delight, and 
although they will bear almost any treatment 
so they be not too cold, and will also grow in 
a stove, they are far better in a dung bed than 
anywhere ; next to this an orchideous house, 
and next to this a stove. The plant is an 
evergreen with shiny leaves, always looking 
well whether in flower or out. In dung beds 
they seldom have either red spider or bug, 
but in the stove they are very subject to both. 
The best remedy in such case is to put them 
in a new hot-bed of a temperature fit for 
cucumbers, water them frequently over the 
foliage, and let them have plenty of steam ; 
but in a dung bed they are seldom infested 
with any thing. The compost, on which a 
remark or two may be made yet, should by 
rights be rotted turf, such as would be cut for 
lawns, rubbed through a very coarse sieve, for 
the double purpose of stopping any very large 
stones from going in, and picking out wire- 
worms, grubs, and insects generally, which as 
they fall through the sieve are seen instantly — 
of this soil two parts ; of peat earth also rubbed 
through a coarse sieve half a part; rotted cow 
dung half a part ; and if this be too adhesive, 
a little silver sand, not exceeding in the whole 
a tenth of the mass, will temper it properly. 
This may lie together in a heap, covered from 
rains in general, but not allowed to get too dry. 
This same compost is good for almost all hard 



wooded plants but heaths, which require a 
good deal more peat earth in proportion to 
the loam. Any one who has a cucumber 
frame at work can get a few slips or cuttings 
of this plant by purchasing one at the market, 
for it is in constant demand at all markets ; 
and by following these directions can without 
any other convenience raise healthy handsome 
specimens. 

NEW GARDEN ERUPTS. 

Several varieties of fruit, which have but 
recently been raised or brought into notice, 
were described at page 95 ; the following notes 
are supplementary to the list there given. As 
will be seen from the description, some of those 
now enumerated are of considerable merit. 

GRAPE. 

Sahibee. — An East Indian variety, intro- 
duced to the Horticultural Society by Col. 
Sykes. It is cultivated by the inhabitants of 
the Deccan, and is an abundant bearer. The 
bunches are large, tapering, somewhat shoul- 
dered, like the Black Hamburgh, and as 
handsome. The berries oval, about the size of 
muscats, but without the muscat flavour ; 
white, with a faint rosy tinge on the side 
next the sun. It is o considered an acquisition. 

PEAR. 

Bergamot Sechle. — A variety of great ex- 
cellence, raised recently by J. "Williams, Esq., 
of Pitmaston, from the Seckle fertilized by 
Gansel's Bergamot. The fruit is rather small, 
roundish, and of a yellowish colour, brownish 
red on the exposed side, with a few russet 
patches ; the eye small and open ; the stem 
short and thick. Its flesh is yellowish white, 
juicy, melting, and sugary, with a little musky 
aroma ; in fact, it may be kept till it becomes 
a ball of almost liquid nectar. It is in use 
early in November ; and grows well as a 
standard. It is figured in Jlfaund's Fruitist. 

APPLES. 

Vesuvius Pippin. — This variety has been 
incidentally noticed at page 188. It was pro- 
duced at one of the meetings of the Horti- 
cultural Society, by A. Arcedeckne, Esq., who 
raised it from seeds which he obtained at the 
priory on Mount Vesuvius, where it is called 
by the monks Mela Appia. The fruit is small, 
oblong, contracted beyond the middle ; in 
colour and glossiness resembling the Lady 
Apple or Pomme d'Api of the French. Its 
quality is excellent ; the flesh crisp and juicy. 
In perfection in January, and may probably 
be kept till April. 

Pitmaston Golden Wreath. — This variety 
is the result of a cross between the Golden 
Pippin apple and the Siberian Crab, the 
former being fertilized by the latter ; and it 
bears amole evidence of its parentage. For

it the horticultural world are indebted to J. 
Williams, of Pitmaston, well known as an 
experimental horticulturist. A more beauti- 
ful object amongst trees can scarcely be ima- 
gined than this variety of apple presents when 
laden with its produce, the branches being 
long, slender, and drooping, and densely 
crowded with fruit. The branches have much 
the character of those of the Siberian Crab, 
being long, slender, and not much branched, 
forming when laden with fruit a brilliant ex- 
hibition of pendent golden wreaths. The tree 
is quite hardy and very productive, but does 
not indicate the attainment of large size : it 
will be an excellent tree for miniature fruit 
gardens. The fruit is roundish, small, a fine 
yellow colour, with here and there a little 
russetty freckling, and a few red specks on the 
exposed side ; the segments of the calyx are 
long, and the eye somewhat furrowed ; the 
stalk long and thin, inserted in a narrow 
cavity ; the flesh is bright yellow, crisp, juicy, 
sweet, and pleasantly flavoured. The fruit 
should be gathered in September, and will 
keep for some time. 

Sjj'tcy Globe Apple. — A local variety, almost 
unknown beyond the neighbourhood where it 
originated — Chaddesley Corbett, in Worcester- 
shire. The fruit is handsome, rather below 
medium size, of an even depressed conical 
form, clear yellow green, deepened to an 
orange tint on the exposed side, and pencilled 
with deep red with a few russetty lines and 
touches, the eye small in a narrow basin, with 
a short connivent calyx ; the stem long, thin, 
and inserted in a narrow cavity. The flesh is 
yellowish white, mild, juicy, and moderately 
sweet, with a pleasant spicy clove-like fra- 
grance. It is suitable either for dessert or 
kitchen use, and is in perfection in November. 
The tree is of small growth, and suited for 
dwarf culture. It is figured in Maund's 
Fruitist. 

CHERRY. 

Sweet Montmorency. — This cherry was 
incidentally noticed at page 189 ; it is an 
American variety, valuable from its lateness, 
being in use from the middle of July till the 
early part of August. The tree is vigorous 
and erect growing ; the fruit il^mgjL nearly 
round, growing in pairs ; when ripe, of a light 
red colour, pale amber in the shade ; stone 
very small. ' When ripening it is very bitter, 
but this passes away, and when fully ripe it is 
rich, melting, sweet, and vinous, with yellow- 
ish coloured flesh. It was an accidental seed- 
ling, and is supposed to have originated from 
the Montmorency Cherry, an early acid fruit. 

STRAWBERRY. 

Austen's Scarlet. — This strawberry appears 
to have been raised some years ago by the 



Rev. J. Austen, of Chevening Rectory, in 
Kent, but is even now little known. It is 
one of the best in the class of scarlets, being 
very early and prolific, and — in its class — 
possessing a peculiar delicacy, both in the 
consistence of its flesh and in its flavour. It 
was raised from seeds of the Downton. The 
most certain produce of the finest fruit is ob- 
tained by annual planting on rich soil. It is 
figured in Maund's Fruitist. 

RASPBERRY. 

Large-fruited Monthly. — Mr. Rivers, of 
Sawbridgeworth, who has grown this new 
autumnal fruiting raspberry, thus speaks of 
it : — " The variety is, I think, one of the most 
valuable introductions we have lately been 
favoured with in this class of fruits. It is, I 
believe, of continental origin. It continues to 
bear from the end of August, all through 
September, October, and if the frost is not 
very severe (it does not mind a slight frost) 
till the end of November ; and is quite equal 
in flavour, as well as in size, to Raspberries in 
July. To ensure a very abundant crop in 
autumn, all the canes should be cut down in 
spring close to the ground ; but a good 
autumnal crop may be obtained, as well as a 
crop in summer, by leaving only one cane, cut 
in the usual manner, to each root, cutting the 
others down closely for the autumnal crop. 
My plants are now (October) covered with 
fruit in all its stages, and many lateral shoots 
are just coming into bloom, so that if grown 
in large pots and placed under glass, Rasp- 
berries may be gathered in December." This 
variety bears its autumnal crop from lateral 
shoots, which are put forth from every joint, 
forming a handsome pyramidal bush. In this 
respect, as well as in its superior size and 
flavour, it differs from the old variety known 
as the double-bearing raspberry. This will 
be quite an acquisition. 

CURRANT. 

Houghton Castle Red. — A large red currant 
which produces very handsome bunches, the 
racemes nearly six inches in length ; the berries 
large, of a darker colour than Wilmot's Red, 
but not so deep as the Red Dutch. The pulp 
contains more mucilage than is usual in red 
currants, and consequently the sharpness of 
the flavour is not so perceptible in the first 
instance ; it is indeed in this respect somewhat 
intermediate between that of the red and white 
currant. In size it is equal to Knight's Large 
Red ; but its principal merit is its late ripen- 
ing. Some of the fruit in excellent condition 
were communicated to Mr. Thompson in the 
beginning of September, from the garden of the 
Duke of Cleveland at Raby Castle, Durham, 
whence it was named the Raby Castle Cur- 
rant: it is also known as May's Victoria.

GLENNY ON THE DAHLIA 



ITS VARIETIES AND CULTURE. 



The history of the Dahlia and its intro- 
duction have been so hacknied by most writers 
who have attempted to instruct us in its culture, 
that we omit all notice of either, except so far 
as to show that when introduced there were 
but few varieties, and these few all single. 
Of course, among botanists, different colours 
were treated as different species, as is usual 
with every thing that comes from a distance ; 
but when the florists took the plant in hand 
all distinctions were levelled. The gentlemen 
who had been figuring three or four different 
colours as so many different species, were 
startled when the early seedlings in this 
country and in Holland produced varieties far 
more distinct from each other than those 
already figured. No plant ever yielded more 
readily to the florist's art, and with such success 
was it raised from seed in this country that all 
kinds of forms, sizes, colours, heights, and foliage 
might be found in one batch of seedlings, 



saved from the same flowers. As with 
botanists a very trifling difference would 
distinguish between two species, the wide 
distinctions to be found among the hundreds 
raised from seed, appeared like a practical 
satire on the minute descriptions of the 
botanists ; and there were even those who 
condemned the doings of florists, and petu- 
lantly observed that such absurd multiplication 
of the varieties was destructive of the original 
species, and would lead to endless confusion. 
The botanists denounced the double varieties 
as monstrous, and for a time opposed the 
public taste, declaring that in double flowers 
all the botanical distinctions, beautiful as they 
were, would be destroyed. The Dahlia was 
for many years only single, and semi-double, 
but the Dutch florists at length obtained them 
very double, and from these importations 
seedlings were raised in France and in Great 
Britain, (for Ireland and Scotland did their

part,) far surpassing in beauty those from 
which they were raised. At the period when 
the varieties were first becoming numerous, and 
Mr. Dennis, who was one of our earliest 
dealers in a large way, catalogued them by 
hundreds, there was every conceivable shape, 
size, and (excepting a blue) colour. There 
never was a subject so likely to be destroyed 
in value by the eagerness to multiply the sorts 
on sale, and the enthusiasm of the public to 
cultivate the largest collection. There was not 
at this time any notion about beauty — singu- 
larity was the first object, and brilliancy of 
colour went a long wa} r towards making a 
flower singular. We had an early notion 
that a check might be put to the evil — which 
could not fail to disgust every body with the 
flower, at least if the wild and weedy sorts 
were encouraged, for we had already got globe- 
formed, anemone-formed, China-aster-formed, 
Hollyhock-formed, and we know not how 
many more — and the plan was to establish 
shows, to lay down the properties of a perfect 
flower, and act upon it. The first show was 
at Billingsgate, when a five-guinea cup was 
given as a first prize, and the money paid for 
entrances was divided into second and third. 
These were given for the best twelve double 
flowers, and all globes, anemone flowers, 
China-aster flowers, and all the other wild 
sporting varieties were excluded. The next 
show under the same auspices was at Ham- 
mersmith, when the first medals were issued 
in the name of the Metropolitan Society, not 
then fully organized. The result of this was 
the public abandonment of all but proper 
double flowers ; and the publication of the 
properties of the dahlia in the Horticultural 
Journal banished all others from the garden, 
as well as from the shows, much to the an- 
noyance of some dealers, who with an eye to 
profit exclusively had been buying up all the 
novel rubbish they could lay their hands on. 
The Metropolitan Society worked a complete 
revolution in floriculture, and especially took 
the Dahlia under its protection ; for there were 
thousands of pounds changed hands yearly for 
that flower alone, and many persons were, by 
means of the impetus which it gave to public 
shows, benefited to a large amount, while the 
trade reaped the advantage from one extreme 
of Europe to the other. Thus much of the 
history of the Dahlia in this country may be 
interesting ; and so it may be worth mentioning 
that Springfield Rival was the first flower that 
reconciled the generality of growers to the 
possibility of approaching the properties laid 
down. Mr. Widnall's Perfection was seized 
upon by the opponents of " the Properties," 
its distinctive character being a rosette out- 
line, while the Springfield Rival was a positive 
circle. However, with these preliminary 



remarks, we will give an outline of the Pro- 
perties we laid down for the perfection of the 
Dahlia, and the culture we adopted, although 
we have repeatedly done this before, and every 
writer who has pretended to instruct us since, 
has only changed our words to give the same 
lesson. 

PROPERTIES OF THE DAHLIA. 

1. The flower should be a perfect circle 
when viewed in front : the petals should be 
broad at the ends, smooth at the edges, thick 
in substance, perfectly free from indenture or 
point, stiff to hold their form ; they should cup 
a little, but not enough to show the under sur- 
face ; they should be in regular rows, forming 
an outline of a perfect circle, without any 
vacancy between them, and all in the circle 
should be the same size, uniformly open to the 
same shape, and not crumpled. 

2. The flower should form two-thirds of a 
ball when looked at sideways. The rows of 
petals should rise one above another sym- 
metrically ; every petal should cover the join 
of the two petals under it — what the florists 
call imbricating, by which means the circular 
appearance is perfected throughout. 

3. The centre should be perfect, the un- 
bloomed petals, laying with their points to- 
wards the centre, should form a button, and 
should be the highest part of the flower com- 
pleting the ball. 

4. The flower should be symmetrical. The 
petals should open boldly, without showing 
their under side, even when half opened, and 
should form circular rows, uniformly laid, 
evenly opened, and enlarging by degrees to 
the outer row of all. 

5. The flower should be very double. The 
rows of petals laying one above another should 
cover one another very nearly ; not more 
should be seen in depth than half the breadth; 
the more they are covered, so as to leave 
them distinct, the better in that respect ; the 
petals, therefore, though cupped, must be 
shallow. 

6. The size of the flower, when well grown, 
should be four inches in diameter, and not 
more than six. 

7. The colour should be dense, whatever it 
be — not as if it were a white dipped in colour, 
but as if the whole flower was coloured through- 
out. Whether tipped or edged, it must be 
free from splashes or blotches, or indefinite 
marks of any kind ; and new flowers, unless 
they beat all the old ones of the same colour, 
or are of a novel colour themselves, with a 
majority of the points of excellence, should be 
rejected. 

If the petals show the under side too much, 
even when looked at sideways — if they do not 
cover each other well — if the centre is com- 



558 



THE DAHLIA. 



posed of petals pointed upwards, or those 
which are round the centre are confused — if the 
petals are too deep and funnel-like — if the 
petals are too narrow, or exhibit too much of 
their length — or if they show any of the green 
scale at the bottoms of the petals — if the eye 
is sunk — if the shoulder is too high, the face 
flat, or the sides too upright — if the petals 
show an indenture, as if heart-shaped — if the 
petals are too large and coarse, or are flimsy, 
or do not hold their form — in any or all these 
cases the flowers are objectionable; and if 
there be one or two of these faults conspicuous, 
the flower is second or third rate. 

If flowers are exhibited which show the 
disc, or a green scale, or have been eaten by 
vermin, or damaged by carriage, or are evi- 
dently decayed, the censors should reject them 
at once. 

BUYING PLANTS. 

These you may select according to the 
number you want, and give your orders early 
that there may be no excuse for disappointing 
you of any scarce sorts. The Garden Almanac 
will guide you well for a small collection, and 
you should be cautious how you add any with- 
out knowing something about them. It is 
better to increase the number of those particular 
sorts which it is desirable to make sure of in 
the stands : as a general rule, it is better to 
double or even treble the mottled or edged 
varieties; for there is a less choice than there 
is among selfs, and there is often a great 
scarcity. 

PREPARING THE GROUND. 

The ground should be dug, and if it will 
bear it, trenched as low as the soil is good, 
turning the bottom to the top. Procure your 
principal stakes, which should be six feet long, 
and drive them into the ground at their proper 
places, which should be six feet apart in the 
rows, and the rows six feet from each other, 
the second row being however driven half way 
between the opening of the first, so that they 



do not look so formal as if they were exactly 
behind each other, and besides which it gives 
them more room in the same space of ground : 
these stakes should be driven a foot and a half 
into the ground. If the ground has been well 
dressed, or is newly turned up — or has, in 
fact, good heart in it, plant without dung; if it 
has been impoverished, put a good spade-full 
of well rotted dung to each stake, and fork it 
into the ground to mix it well, in about a foot 
circle in front of the stake, and leave a hole 
in the centre, which must not be disturbed : 
place all the pots with their plants at their 



several stakes, and then go round with a 
trowel and plant the balls of earth six inches 
from the stake, sloping towards it, and the 
plant may be covered up to the depth of four 
inches, if necessary, without the least injury; 
and if the plants be lankey, they are the better 
for being covered up a little, and shortening the 
plant above ground. "Water freely after plant- 
ing, not merely at the plant, but a good way 
round it. Here a single loose tie, to protect 
them from the wind, is necessary, and any 
bandage or stick on the plant at the time of 
planting must be removed, for these ties will, 
if not removed, cut completely through the 
plant. 

TRAINING THE PLANTS. 

With good growth the Dahlia requii'es three 
more stakes driven down in angular form, as 
soon as the side branches make much growth, 
but the main stem is to be fastened to the centre 
stake. The branches ought not to be in each 
other's way, therefore, if this is likely to occur, 
remove the intruding shoot or branch; but 
never thin a plant for the mere sake of thin- 
ning. When the buds appear they may be 
and often are more numerous than ought to 
be permitted to bloom, but they should not be 
much thinned in their incipient state; as soon 
as they indicate whether there is a chance of 
their making a flower 1 , the most promising may 
be kept for blooming, the least promising may 
be removed ; any branch too beyond the 
flower should be taken away, and the end of 
the shoot on which there is a flower may 
be taken off: all small weakly branches may 
be cut out, so also may all branches that are 
in the way of more important ones. The 
flowers as they advance, according to modern 
practice, are fixed in a sort of table, made with 
a square board of half inch thickness, with 
a slit just wide enough to pass the stem 
through, and holes at the corners to fix upon 
a leg or legs. The board, or table, is generally 
nine inches square, and made thus — 




and when fixed on 
would be thus — 



its legs, the appearance 



THE DAHLIA. 



559 



The bud intended to be protected is thus 
placed — 




The slit is filled up with wadding, so as 
to prevent any kind of insect from getting 
through it, and the bloom is brought to 
maturity under a flower-pot or a glass, or 
a cover made on purpose, like an inverted pot 
without a bottom, and a cover and glass to fit, 
and to use according as the grower requires 
light or darkness for his flower. The extent 
to which this artificial mode of blooming has 
of late proceeded has tended greatly to pro- 
duce flowers in an artificial state, — the colours 
and character are not then fairly developed ; 
a tipped or edged flower will come plain, or 
with the tip or edging very indistinct ; and 
they will neither last so long, nor travel so 
well, nor be so brilliant. If the object be 
merely to keep away vermin, it is paying a 
great sacrifice of beauty for the saving of a 
little sacrifice in labour. However, such is 
the practice ; and nearly all growers do it for 
the sake of size, and a supposed, or perhaps 
real assistance to a centre naturally defective. 
During all the blooming time, as promising 
buds come out, they are adjusted into tables 
like these and covered, and while they are in an 
earlier stage they are tied up in a gauze bag. 
As soon as it is discovered that a bud is use- 
less it must be taken off, and the same pre- 
caution taken with flowers as soon as they 
have gone by or become of no service ; for it 
aids a plant much more than cutting away 
branches, which is by many carried to excess, 
so as to defeat the object, for we maintain that 
the perfection of pruning is to remove only the 
branches that are in the way and the buds that 
are not wanted. 

TAKING UP THE TUBEES. 

Dahlias in general are allowed to bloom too 
long : when they have exhausted themselves, 
which will be in October, and early planted 
ones sooner, so as to throw no more good 
flowers, the roots on which we rely for our 
next year's stock ought to have a fork or spade 
put under them, and be lifted enough to dis- 
turb them ; the plants will then wither, and 
in a week from the time they were disturbed 



they may be taken up, cleared of their mould, 
their stems cut down to three or four inches 
in length, and the tubers be put into a dry 
place, to which neither heat nor frost can find 
access — the one would dry and shrivel them, 
the other rot them : the labels should be 
fastened with wire, for string of any kind will 
perish. 

PROPAGATION. 

There are several modes of increasing the 
Dahlia. For an amateur, who does not re- 
quire many plants from each tuber, it will be 
enough to put the tubers in the warm stove, 
or in a slight hot- bed without planting or pot- 
ting them, and sprinkle them occasionally 
with water ; this will cause the eyes to start. 
The tubers may be then separated into as 
many pieces as there are eyes, each eye having 
a portion of tuber to it. There is no neces- 
sity for a large piece of tuber ; it may be cut 
so as to go into a moderate sized pot, and be 
grown in the hot-bed stove, or even green- 
house ; but the season at which they are 
separated must be selected according to the 
convenience. If there be no hot-house nor 
greenhouse, nor hot-bed, the roots may be 
kept in a basket near the kitchen fire, and 
there be sprinkled occasionally, until they are 
separated, which cannot be done with ad- 
vantage until the eyes have all fairly started. 
This plan will generally produce as much in- 
crease as an amateur requires. Where 
there is no convenience for potting, plant them 
at once in- the ground, with the crowns six 
inches below the surface. Those who desire 
a larger increase should pot them, and as the 
shoots get two inches long, carefully break 
them out, by pressing them backwards and 
forwards near the bottom ; place them one 
each in thumb-pots, and put them in a hot- 
bed to strike, which, if kept moist, they will 
do in a few days, and continue doing this until 
there are enough plants ; but if a large number 
is required, let the shoots all grow three inches 
long, and with a sharp knife cut thern off just 
under the lower pair of leaves, which will 
cause numerous other shoots to come forward, 
fit for the same treatment, which may be kept 
on until any quantity required is secured ; 
but it should be remembered that this could 
be continued until by excessive and rapid pro- 
pagation the constitution of the plant would 
be changed, and very double varieties rendered 
semi-double, or even single. Nobody, how- 
ever, who could procure pot-roots, however 
small, or pieces of tuber with a single eye, 
should ever use plants ; for a piece of tuber 
with an eye, or a pot-root however small, will 
make a far better plant than even an early 
cutting. The cuttings as they are struck, 
should be put into a frame rather cooler, and 



560 



THE DAHLIA. 



by degrees be inured to a cold frame, pre- 
vious to planting out. 

DAHLIAS FROM SEED. 

Sow in the early part of March; if in any 
quantity, make up a hot-bed and sow it lightly 
all over, but if not more than can be sown in 
pans or boxes, be it so. In a few days the 
seeds will come up, and will require a little air 
and occasional moisture ; when they are large 
enough to transplant, you may either make up 
a hot-bed with rather slight heat, or use one 
whose strongest heat has gone by, and plant 
them out all over it two inches apart, or put 
half a dozen round the edge of a wide-mouthed 
sixty or forty-eight sized pot, and return them 
to the hot-bed. They will require air, and 
water, and light, but it will be as well to shade 
them from the heat of the sun until they are 
well established, and of sufficient strength to 
bear it without injury ; the seedling plants 
must be treated in all respects like struck cut- 
tings until planting time, except that it is not 
worth the trouble to put them in single pots 
at all, unless you have but very few, and those 
very choice: they maybe planted out between 
the 20th and 30th of May, and not too 
shallow ; a foot apart in the row, and the rows 
a yard from each other, is distant enough for 
seedlings in the ordinary way. As soon as they 
indicate worthlessness, which a large portion 
generally will, dig them clean up and destroy 
them ; and when any appear promising, put 
stakes to them and tie them up properly, but 
there will in general be very few worth the 
trouble among ordinary seedlings. "Where 
there is one which is an improvement upon the 
present varieties there are hundreds that are 
not, so that by looking very critically among 
them as they come into flower they will be 
rapidly thinned. Should there be any that are 
really good, you may take off side shoots and 
try to strike them ; they will require a fresh 
hot-bed, which should be got ready in antici- 
pation of the chance, and by putting the 
cuttings in singly in thumb-pots, and keeping 
a good heat, there is a chance of success ; this 
is so desirable with anything really good, that 
it should never be neglected, because if a plant 
can but be made to bulb a little, or live through 
the winter, it will be a prize in the spring ; and 
sometimes first-rate things have been known 
to be saved by such means when the old tuber 
has rotted. 

PRESERVING ROOTS OR TUBERS IN WINTER. 

We have already observed that tubers should 
be kept where neither heat nor damp nor frost 
can reach them, and there are many ways of 
doing this ; some pack them in sand, — some 
keep them in a dry cellar, — some put them in 
the greenhouse. There are twenty ways of 



keeping a few, but where there are many there 
is more difficulty. It is common for valuable 
roots or tubers to be kept where they can be 
constantly examined, and common ones are 
often consigned to the greenhouse under the 
stage ; but even here they ought not to lie in 
heaps, but spread out singly, or nearly so, that 
the wet, which cannot fail to sprinkle them 
every time the plants are watered, may dry 
quickly : this would seem to be a secure place, 
because it is imperative to keep the frost out 
on account of the other plants. The stems 
should be shortened to an inch, and when'spread 
out on the ground, or packed up, or disposed of 
any other way, the stem should be placed down- 
wards, for were the hollow stem to receive the 
wet, or even retain its own juice, it would be 
frequently found to rot the collar of the tuber, 
which would fail to break in the spring. 

DRESSING THE FLOTVERS FOR EXHIBITION. 

However distasteful it may be to those clever 
artists who can almost double the apparent 
value of a flower by dressing it, we must pro- 
test against a growing evil that has deceived, 
and will so long as itfis tolerated deceive, the 
purchasers of novelties, and dissatisfy those 
who do not practice such deception. It is 
already known that there is scarcely a worse 
fault than quilled petals; the back or rough 
surface of the petal is seen in front, the ap- 
pearance of the flower is dull and un-uniform, 
and there is a fatal want of symmetry. Now, 
the clever manufacturer can, by insinuating 
the point of a tapering dresser into the opening 
end of the petal, and pressing it in gently, 
open it more, and by going over the flower re- 
peatedly, so open the quilled petals by degrees 
that they appear as if they opened naturally; 
and a variety that would be condemned, 
actually appears pretty and passable, although 
a gentleman — who would never condescend 
to such questionable means — would never pro- 
duce a flower like the dressed one in a dozen 
seasons. In selecting seedlings to name and 
propagate, for the purpose of adding them to 
collections, avoid such as do not open freely ; 
for Societies will be obliged to adopt some 
measure to put a stop to the discreditable 
practice of opening the petals. In 1846, 
several varieties that had been exhibited in a 
very pretty and passable condition at different 
shows, and that were admired enough to tempt 
the inexperienced growers, were sold out at 
half a guinea, never to be worth sixpence to the 
buyer, and are now altogether discarded from 
good collections, as well as from the principal 
catalogues. It behoves, therefore, all persons 
who save novelties to observe that unless they 
open freely they are highly objectionable. The 
character bestowed on some very showy flowers 
of " quills too much," or " apt to be quilly," 



THE DAHLIA.

is a sad drawback to the value of a flower, and 
unless there be some very novel and desirable 
quality they should not be grown by people of 
limited means. 

THE SAVING OF SEED. 

Save no pods but those which have belonged 
to fine specimens of the bloom, and were for 
this purpose marked while in perfection, for it 
is greatly against seed to save it from imperfect 
flowers ; yet nothing is more common than the 
practice of trusting to any pods that may be 
found, without knowing or caring from what 
flowers they originated. The number of hopeful 
seedlings would be greatly increased by the pre- 
caution of picking off all imperfect buds the 
moment their imperfections are discovered, and 
leaving for seed only those which are perfect 
enough to exhibit. There can be no harm in 
planting out some of the best varieties far 
removed from the remainder of the collection, 
so as to get a good variety of seed ; but even 
here all the imperfect buds and flowers should 
be removed, and none but perfect ones allowed 
to produce pods. In this way, with a very good 
selection to begin with, there would be some 
hope of obtaining much better things than we 
possess. 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The watering of Dahlias, like that of many 
other subjects, is of but little use unless the 
ground be well saturated for a good distance 
round it, or in fact all over, for the supplying 
of water at the root only is of very temporary 
benefit, inasmuch as the parched earth all round 
absorbs the moisture so rapidly that a very short 
time after it is applied it ceases to be beneficial. 
Many persons mulch round the stem with 
dung for some distance, but there are great 
objections to it; first, it is a universal harbour 
for earwigs and other annoying and destructive 
insects, and it is impossible to dislodge or get 
rid of them ; next, it brings the fibres of the 
roots to the top of the soil, and when dry the 
plants suffer in a short time almost past re- 
covery. It is far better to dung the ground 
well, plant rather deep, and water all the ground, 
in preference to wetting merely immediately 
close to the stem. Another bad practice is to 
water often and superficially, instead of seldom 
and downright well ; when the ground has a 
good soaking and the water sinks deep, 
the roots will go after it, and do not suffer 
from every little change of weather. 

There is a mode of grafting the Dahlia which 
it is hardly fair to adopt, because there is no 
excuse for it on ordinary occasions, — for a 
piece that would do for a graft would do for a 
cutting to strike. The evil arising from the 
grafting of a Dahlia is, that the tuber is not a 
representative of the variety, when taken up 

48. 



after blooming, and therefore a grafted plant 
would deceive a buyer. It has been said, too, 
that there is a way of cutting out the eyes at 
the bottom of the plant, so that the buyer is 
unable to calculate on propagating the follow- 
ing season ; this, if it be done at all, is 
nothing short of a robbery, because a Dahlia 
is not worth the money charged except for the 
means of increasing it. We, however, do not 
believe in one half the practices which have 
been attributed to dealers; not that we deny 
such things have been done by an ill-principled 
man, but we believe it to be very rare, and by 
persons of no reputation. The grafting of a 
Dahlia is only justifiable when on account of 
a late season, or the chance of losing a va- 
riety, it may be desirable to propagate every 
morsel, and huny the growth. A good sound 
tuber may be cut on one side, and a small 
cutting of a plant be fitted to it, and tied round 
with a piece of bast-matting and potted, so 
that the tuber and the portion of cutting fitted 
to it be under the surface. This will take 
readily to growth, and advance much more 
rapidly than if it were placed in as a cutting; 
but it is only a plant for the season. The 
tuber is useless, for it is necessary to cut away 
anything that would grow before it is used as 
a grafting stock. With this we close our 
general remarks, and proceed to lay down a 
few simple rules for each month's culture. 

JANUARY. 

The only necessary duty this month is to 
examine as far as practicable all the tubers, 
and if any indicate shrivelling or rotting, let 
them be potted at once, first removing every 
part that is decayed or decaying ; and if there 
be any very choice, that it is desirable to start 
early, for the sake of extensive propagation, 
let them be potted. The collar of the plant 
should be above the surface, and that the pot 
may not be unnecessarily large, reduce the 
tuber by cutting away straggling parts and 
shortening the lobes, that the tuber may take 
up less room. 

FEBRUARY. 

Continue the examination of tubers, and 
besides any that may want immediate atten- 
tion, pot those which may require to be most 
extensively propagated : you may also pot the 
whole collection by degrees, unless, as is 
frequently done, the bulk of them are to be 
planted in a hot-bed; for it is frequently de- 
sirable to place the tubei's side by side in the 
soil of a hot-bed made for the purpose of start- 
ing them, but it is done to save room ; otherwise 
potting is far better, as they may be easily re- 
moved to operate upon, take off cuttings, and 
strike them singly in pots of the smallest size 
but one — called thumb-pots. 
o o

THE DAHLIA. 



MARCH. 

Set all to work now, and examine all that 
are growing, daily, to take off the cuttings re- 
gularly as they advance ; these when they 
become numerous may be struck several in a 
pot, as a striking heat must be greater than a 
simple growing heat after they are struck, and 
it may be advisable to take up as little room 
as possible ; but if there be plenty of room to 
strike in, it saves a good deal of labour to 
strike them singly in the pots they are to be 
kept in till planting time. Sow seed in pots 
or in a frame and light, over a gentle hot-bed 
made on purpose. 

APRIL. 

Continue to take off cuttings and strike them, 
remove those already struck into a cooler hot- 
bed, or make up a new one to strike in, and 
continue those that are struck in the frame 
they were struck in, which will have declined 
a good deal. Of course in cases where a pro- 
pagating house is used, and ample room 
afforded, it is only necessary to remove the 
struck ones to a cooler place or pit, and by 
degrees harden them off : air must be given to 
those which are growing, to prevent them from 
drawing up. Pot off seedlings, or thin them 
and prick out the spare ones. 

MAY. 

The plants are now ready to plant out or send 
out, but it is not safe to plant round London 
till after the 20th of the month, unless you 
cover up with a flower-pot with the hole 
stopped, at every indication Of a frost, and 
always at sun-set ; but after the 20th they are 
pretty safe, and when they are planted a pro- 
per depth, which is the crown four to six 
inches below the surface, they will always 
break out again, even if the frost cuts them 
down a little. Continue striking cuttings of 
all likely to be useful. Catch and kill ear- 
wigs by every means that can be devised, from 
the instant the plants are in the ground. 

JUNE. 

Plant out all the collection, some at the be- 
ginning, others for late blooms at the end of 
the month. Continue trapping earwigs, and 
examine the traps daily twice. Plant out the 
remainder of the seedlings in rows, the plants 
a foot apart, the rows a yard from each other. 
JULr. 

Add other stakes to the vigorously growing 
plants, and daily examine the earwig traps, 
and tie up growing branches ; where any 
branches are growing in each other's way take 
off those that can best be spared, and what- 
ever blooms come prematurely or imperfect 
pull off. Water only when it is absolutely neces- 
sary, and then do it effectually by well soaking 



the whole ground. If any seedlings bloom, 
remove the inferior ones the instant you can 
discover their blemishes. 

AUGUST. 

The flowers are now coming forward 
rapidly. Continue to kill every stray earwig.- 
If the plants are grown for their beauty in the 
garden, they should be neatly and handsomely 
trained, but if they are grown for exhibition 
continue to remove all blooms which will not 
perfect themselves, and prepare to shade those 
which will be useful ; place extra stakes where 
required, and where any particlar bloom is 
wanted for show remove the buds which are 
in its way, and so fasten it that none of the 
leaves or other flowers can touch it, even in 
case of wind. If the first blooms are to be 
covered, let them be fixed for that purposes- 
Examine the seedlings daily, to turn out those 
which are useless, and place stakes to any that 
seem promising. Side shoots of new varieties 
may be struck in a good strong moist heat. 

SEPTEMBER. 

Continue the treatment of last month in 
every respect, but remember that in shading, 
a bloom that has been uncovered is more bril- 
liant, more lasting, and more desirable, because 
more in character, than those which have been 
constantly confined. A common shade made 
of paper, that keeps off the sun and gives the 
benefit of all the air, is most proper for use. 

OCTOBER. 

As the plants begin to exhaust themselves, 
or in the event of a frost, put the spade under 
the tubers and detach them from the ground a 
little without removing them altogether, and 
earth them up a little in case of severe frost : 
after they have been lifted a few days they 
may be taken up, cleared of their mould, have 
their labels fastened on with wires, and the 
stems cut down to an inch in length ; they may 
then be put in a place well protected, to dry 
stem downwards. Seedlings worth saving 
may be taken up, and their description taken 
in a book or marked on their labels. 

NOVEMBER. 

Store the tubers where neither heat, frost, 
nor damp can touch them, and if practicable, 
where they can be examined from time to 
time ; those roots which appear hardly matured 
should be potted directly. Pot roots are as 
well preserved in their pots as any how, the 
pots may be laid on their sides in any dry 
corner or place. Late struck cuttings may be 
kept growing. 

DECEMBER. 

Nothing can be done now but occasionally 
to examine the tubers, to see all is going on

right. If any shrivel or commence rotting, or 
there is any danger of losing them, let them be 
set to work immediately, to get a cutting or 
two from them before they are quite gone.

THE NEW DAHLIAS FOR 1848. 

The new dahlias for May next do not pre- 
sent very attractive features ; there are very 
few, if any, first-rate, but many useful and 
some popular varieties. We shall not pretend 
to recommend one more than another, but en- 
deavour to describe all that are to be submitted 
by the principal growers, or that have appeared 
at the leading exhibitions. If we omit any 
it will be for the want of the names being 
given, or the absence of any point worth 
mentioning. 

The Queen of England. — A flower ex- 
hibited in an overgrown state, and therefore 
to all appearance above the medium size, and 



proportionably coarse, but very gay in colour? 
double and symmetrical, eye rather loose, face a 
little flat, deeply marked edge of rich lake. 
If we may give an opinion founded on its over- 
grown state, we should say that grown mode- 
rately it would be a very showy and useful 
variety. 

Walter Hilson. — Grown over much, and 
therefore larger and coarser than it ought to 
be ; a brilliant orange, brighter than any other 
of its class, outline moderate, petals small and 
close, very symmetrical, face rather flat. A 
flower that would be infinitely better grown of 
a moderate size, but evidently overdone at 
the shows. 

War Eagle. — Colour bright red, outline 
pretty fair, the flower double and symmetrical, 
size medium or rather under, to all appearance 
likely to be a useful though not a very novel 
variety. 

Nell Gwynne. — A buff or rather dull- 
shaded primrose, without being first-rate in 
any particular point, sufficiently good in most, 
to show as a variety ; face tolerable, centre 
passable, altogether very distinct and symmetri- 
cal, and may prove a useful flower in a stand 
of twenty-four, where there is generally too 
many in a class. 

Compacta. — Rosy lilac. A flower very 
little shown, good outline, well cupped, almost 
inclined to quill too much, but likely to be 
very useful in its class ; size medium, colour 
desirable, and may be caught as an excellent 
flower, very double and tolerably compact. 

Amy. — A tipped flower, very showy, the 
purple being distinct, and though not a first- 
rate outline, very likely to be useful on account 
of the scarcity of even second-class light 
flowers. 

Belted Knight. — A sort of shaded flower, 
in which there are deepest yellow approaching 
to orange- salmon colour, and occasionally 
white. A fancy flower, very bold and showy, 
outline not first-rate, face inclined to flatness, 
but desirable on account of its novelty. 

Hamlet. — A mottled flower, in which 
bright crimson predominates. One of the 
novelties of the season, which possesses, to a 
certain degree, most of the requisite qualities, 
without being extraordinary in any of them. 
A flower that will be grown pretty generally 
by exhibitors. 

Boule de feu. — Bright scarlet, quills a 
good deal and petals scarcely touch, size me- 
dium, general form good, very double and 
symmetrical, centre a little sunk, and may be 
called a good thick flower ; shoulder rising 
almost too much, which gives the fall to the 
centre. 

Crocus. — A very bright yellow, average 
form, but nothing very extraordinary, size 
medium, tolerably double and symmetrical, 
o o2

THE DAHLIA. 



centre pretty good, and the flower likely to be 
useful. 

Danecroft Hero. — Claret, possesses a 
little of all the requisite qualities, but none in 
the highest degree ; colour desirable, and a 
useful flower in a stand of twenty-four ; tole- 
rably double and thick, and the size medium. 

Samuel Girling. — Bright puce or purple. 
Of medium size, outline and general form 
good, flower double and symmetrical, quills oc- 
casionally more than we like a good deal, so 
that in that state the petals do not touch each 
other, but likely to be very useful when 
grown well, for it has an excellent centre. 

Helen Carr. — Blush-white tipped with 
pink. Of tolerable form, medium size, double 
and symmetrical ; a pretty flower when well 
grown, and may be considered useful, the 
character we are obliged to give to too many 
flowers this season. 

Jenny Lind. — Dark crimson-purple and 
pure white, petals full long, and a little rough, 
but a beautiful fancy flower of medium size, 
very double, with excellent centre, and sym- 
metrical. May be placed among the best of 
the fancy flowers of the season. 

Letitia. — Lilac-purple tipped with white. 
A very distinct fancy flower of average 
qualities, very pretty and very useful, but not 
first-rate. 

Magpie. — A fancy flower, rather more 
quilly than we like, but very double, very 
dark, and the tips pink and white, but the 
white not always present, though the tips are 
always light. When the white comes perfectly 
it is splendid, but always distinct and 
showy. 

Remembrancer. — A pinky-scarlet tipped 
or edged with white, very double and gay ; 
distinct fancy flower, useful as a variety, and 
good average size and form. 

Robin Hood. — Red and white, good aver- 
age form, double and symmetrical, different 
shade from any of the good ones in its class 
of red and white. 

Mont Blanc. — Large white flower, in- 
clined to coarseness, not a circular outline, 
and petals a little rough, the centre good and 
well up, and for symmetry pretty good. The 
petals full large. 

Primrose superior. — Pale yellow; ordi- 
nary flower, of no great pretensions, no great 
faults, possessing the properties in a moderate 
degree, but not first-rate; average size and 
form, eye a little low. 

Negro. — A very dark crimson ; may prove 
handy, but inferior to the present dark flowers, 
Berryer, Stopford, and Triumph in coarseness 
and general proportion ; outline not first-rate, 
and centre a little low. 

Preeminent. — White tipped with red, of 
secondary quality, form and properties below 



average, outline not round, a little coarse, and 
only pretty when at its best. 

Lady Ashley. — Rosy lilac, size below 
medium, outline good, shoulder high, centre a 
little down, petals good and plenty of them ; 
they quill occasionally too much, but the flower 
has not been well exhibited; generally very 
symmetrical. 

Rob Roy. — A sort of fancy flower, crimson 
and yellow, below average size, moderately 
good form, double, and fair centre ; may make 
a good change in a fancy stand. 

Fire King. — Very brilliant orange scarlet, 
full average size, tolerable good form, quills a 
little more than we like, but is to be grown 
well, and when perfect a very striking addi- 
tion to a good stand. 

Delight. — A white flower richly tipped with 
crimson-purple, round, full, double, symme- 
trical and very striking, the most likely flower 
to follow in the steps of Marchioness Corn- 
wallis, and beat everything in its class. It is 
thought by many to be the gem of the season, 
and if we could only buy one dahlia, that one 
would be Delight. 

Miranda. — White with rose edges or tips, 
size below medium, very double and symme- 
trical, outline not first-rate, centre fair, and 
upon the whole a pretty, not a noble flower ; 
a good front row. 

Oracle, — White tipped with purple-rose, 
possessing a small share of all the points, but 
none in perfection. May be found useful 
where light flowers are scarce, but nothing 
striking in it. 

Louise. — A pretty light flower, white with 
a little rosy tip or shade, without any first- 
rate claims as a show flower, but a perfect 
beauty as a plant, as dwarf and as abundant in 
its bloom as the old Globe crimson, with 
flowers occasionally showable and the colours 
very pretty. 

Admiral Dundas. — Dark purple shaded 
with marone. A very neat dark flower, good 
when bloomed perfect, but we suspect a little 
treacherous in the eye, which, unless we be dis- 
appointed, will come open sometimes ; when 
well grown, quite equal, perhaps superior, to 
Admiral Stopford. 

Othello. — A dark flower in the way of 
Essex Triumph, with petals not quite so 
coarse nor so long, good centre, and face 
well rounded, outline only middling, flower 
double, symmetrical, size medium. 

Gem. — A remarkably showy flower, white, 
tipped with deep rosy lilac or light purple, 
petals large, size of flower above medium, 
colours rather fleeting, but when perfect re- 
markably striking, after the fashion of the 
Maid of Bath, but every way better, rather 
open for the present day, but will be a useful 
flower when in good colour. 



THE HYDRANGEA AND ITS CULTURE. 



565 



Brutus. — A rich crimson self, possessing 
a little of most of the properties, but not re- 
markable in any; has the appearance of being 
constant, size medium, and the petals pretty 
symmetrical. 

Lady Sale. — A rich fancy flower, pui'e, 
yellow, and white tips, good average form, full 
medium size, double, symmetrical, and a good 
centre. 

Bella Donna. — A fancy flower, a singular 
red with white tips, size medium, very double, 
symmetrical, and well up, outline not first-rate, 
but the flower is an acquisition. 

Jeanie Deans. — A really fine and well- 
formed deep red and white fancy flower, very 
double and symmetrical, very distinct, and a 
pretty variety for one or half a dozen; size 
medium. 

Fire King. — Bright red, not however so 
bright as the first Fire King we noticed, but 
much darker shade; size average, nothing re- 
markable in the form, but centre pretty good. 

Maid op Honour. — A light blush with 
occasional shades of darker colour, without 
any very remarkable properties, a sort of 
common-place form, but very delicate colour. 

Shylock. — A bright red flower, with every 
appearance of being constant and uniform; 
outline moderate, face and centre excellent, 
petals rather large than otherwise for the size 
of the flower, which is medium, and likely 
enough to be in every stand next autumn. 

Canary. — A large dull sulphur yellow or 
canary-colour, very double and symmetrical, 
full average size, outline not perfectly round, 
centre very good, face rather flat than other- 
wise. 

Attraction. — A rich shaded flower of 
dark and light purple or crimson, something 
like Bedford Surprise, treacherous in the eye, 
good general form, well up in the centre, and 
if the eye be not too apt to come cross, will be 
a rich variety. 

Forest flower. — A large dark lilac, thick 
petals, petals large and coarse, every ap- 
pearance of being grown too strong, and of 
being better adapted to moderate cultivation, 
outline moderate, face pretty good, and nothing 
amiss with the centre but being a little too flat. 

Jane. — A blush white or paper white, 
shown too large and coarse, a fault which too 
many growers of the dahlia are now guilty of. 
Varieties which are very large, very coarse, 
and useless under very exciting growth, will 
come better formed, a better size, and more 
compact with ordinary cultivation. 

Mrs. Shaw Lefevre. — A fancy flower of 
more than ordinary pretensions, a curious dull 
red tipped with white, size average, form ex- 
cellent, very double, very well up on the face, 
and perfect in the centre. 

Sir Robert Peel. — Dull red, good centre, 



size medium, or rather below, outline not very 
good, face middling, upon the whole no great 
acquisition. 

Yellow Perfection. — Only two blooms 
shown, one all it ought to be, compact, round, 
full, symmetrical, good centre, and medium 
size; the other not so full in the face, shoulder 
higher, petals somewhat coarser, but outline 
just as good. 

Eliza Meillez. — Fancy flower, of con- 
siderable novelty and merit, crimson and yel- 
low, double, symmetrical, and highly useful to 
exhibitors. 

Privateer. — Bright yellow with a blood- 
coloured edge, moderate outline, fair face and 
good centre, a likely flower to be useful. 

THE HYDRANGEA AND ITS CULTURE. 

Few plants show so readily the advantage 
of good culture over ordinary growth, as the 
Hydrangea kortensis : in common it is a 
flowering shrub with a number of heads of 
pink or bluish flowers, handsome and tolerably 
lasting ; with care and proper treatment it is 
a small plant with a noble bunch of flowers as 
large as a man's head, the individual flowers 
that form the bunches are as fine and as superior 
as the bunch itself. The plant is not hardy, 
but is at least what is called half-hardy; indeed, 
by protecting the roots with litter it may be 
grown like a fuchsia in the open air, merely 
cutting down the branches and covering up 
the plant with tan or other stuff to keep out 
actual hard frost, for a little will not affect it. 
They are to be grown two ways, one for the 
quantity of heads of bloom and the other for 
the size of a single head. The former way 
first: — As soon as a cutting is struck pinch out 
the eye, and thus induce side ones; as these 
advance pinch out the ends of them also, that 
they may in turn push out side shoots, and 
continue in this way stopping until you have 
as many branches as you want blooms; mean- 
while you are shifting it into larger pots as 
the others fill with roots, and if any branches 
come out where they are not wanted they 
should be taken off". In this way the plant 
may make its full growth, and if it bloom the 
same season, well, if not, no matter; but at the 
fall of the year the leaves will drop, and the 
plant may be allowed to rest. As the buds begin 
to swell the plant may be repotted in a pot 
considerably larger than the one it has filled, 
and it may be set growing. Remove all the 
small branches that look weakly, and shorten 
any that have grown uncouth and out of shape 
and keeping with the rest of the plant; gentle 
heat will force them earlier, but the green- 
house is the proper place for healthy growth ; 
let the plant have plenty of air and light, and 
it will continue to grow fast without drawing ;

but if you neglect these two points the plant 
will become drawn and awkward and not sup- 
port its heads of bloom well: the flower will 
soon show, and the watering must be attended 
to very regularly all the time the heads are 
swelling and the flowers developing themselves. 
If the green-house light is only in front, the 
plant should be turned every two or three 
days all the time it is growing, otherwise it 
would get one-sided and ungainly. The flowers 
of the hydrangea are £rowina the whole time 
they are on the plant and in colour, but when 
that begins to fade into a green like the leaves 
of the plant, they grow no more. On this 
plant you may have as many heads as you 
please, but you can never form the heads so 
large as when you grow only one upon a single 
stem. As a garden ornament the hydrangea 
is very noble, and there are few subjects 
prettier than these plants in a border. They 
may be turned out of pots as early as May, 
and will grow far better than even in pots if 
the stuff they grow in is good. Cuttings may 
be taken in the autumn, and being cut up to a 
joint may be struck in a cold frame ; when 
potted out singly into pots of the size forty-eight, 
they may be allowed to grow with a single 
shoot, and the other buds should be rubbed off 
before they can grow to weaken the plant. As 
soon as the pot is filled with roots change it 
for a size thirty-two, and after that to a twenty- 
four, in which a single head will perfect itself 
well. "With regard to the stuff in which they 
are to be grown, it is usual among those that 
fancy them much, to have them in different 
composts, some grown in loam and dung half 
and half, others with loam-peat and dung in 
equal portions, a third peat and dung only. 
The flowers will be differently shaded in these 
three composts, and some will be weaker than 
others, but the different style of growth is 
pleasing where people want a variety. With 
respect also to the colouring of the blooms, 
we have seen the same pot of cuttings produce, 
in turn, blue and bright pink, without being 
able to fix upon the agent which caused the 
change, but we have suspected it to be in the 
peat earth, because those planted in the com- 
mon borders grew well and bloomed with pink 
flowers, and those which were in the peat 
bed among Americans had blue, and very 
strong blue ; it was natural therefore to infer 
that there was something in the peat that had 
the effect of changing the flowers to a blue. 
Many recipes have been given by various 
gardeners for turning the flowers blue, but up 
to the last we have seen every one fail, and 
also seen the plant give blue flowers with the 
recipes applied, but that there is some com- 
bination, at present unknown, is quite certain ; 
and we know from repeated trials by ourselves 
and others, that all the known means applied 



one year when the flowers have come blue, 
have been applied the very next year and 
failed, so that there is no certainty at present, 
although experiment will some day reduce the 
matter to a certainty. When these plants get 
large all the branches must be pruned back, 
that it may throw out young shoots all over, 
and be a well-furnished plant every year. If 
planted in the garden in the middle of a clump, 
Or on the lawn, a regular frame-work of good 
strong willow sticks should be placed over it, 
that it might be matted through the hard 
weather : it will save a good deal of the wood 
that might otherwise be cut down in a severe 
frost, and when the plant is springing, pruned 
afterwards, in a way to form a good bold 
bushy plant, the large size it acquires in two 
or three seasons is astonishing, for when it 
once lays hold and establishes itself in ground 
that agrees with it, the plants soon become 
enormous bushes : all that need be done is to 
cut in all the branches, to clear half or a third 
of the quantity of eyes, that they may all be 
induced to shoot. There is scarcely any thing 
looks more showy than a very noble bush of 
it in good flower, and we have seen them our- 
selves with three hundred heads of bloom, the 
bush being six feet through, all bushy alike to 
the ground, and a head of bloom at the end of 
every shoot both principal and lateral. It is 
worth mentioning one more circumstance in 
connexion with the colour of the bloom; a 
plant was put out on the lawn, a hole being 
made by taking out nearly a barrow full of loam, 
half of this was mixed with as much peat 
earth, and the plant placed in it ; for two 
seasons it bloomed blue, the third season it 
had become very large and all the blooms were 
pink: our conclusion was that the peat made 
it blue, and that it had now got through that 
into the plain loam, and thus resumed its pink. 
There is no doubt something in peat which 
causes the change, but then all peat is not 
alike. 

DATURA ARBOREA ; ITS CULTURE. 

The old Datura arborea, now often erro- 
neously called Brugmansia, is one of the most 
showy plants in cultivation ; and with its 
white funnel-shaped flowers, borne in pro- 
fusion, and hanging pendently from all the 
branches, forms one of the most pleasing ob- 
jects in the conservatory or on the lawn. The 
pendent disposition of the blooms renders it 
best as a standard, and the same may be said 
of the other kinds,* D. sanguinea and D. 
lutca, though their flowers are not half so 
interesting ; there is, however, a double white 
called, Knight ii, that is very curious and _ in- 
teresting, and should be grown in a collection. 
These Daturas are rapid growers, succulent,

•and with large foliage ; the best way of pro- 
pagating them is by eyes, the same as you 
would propagate a vine. Take the last year's 
wood, — in fact, Avhen the plant has done grow- 
ing and flowering and the leaves fall, the 
branches have to be cut back to some tolerably 
graceful form. When they have once attained 
a good.size, they should be preserved as if they 
were roses upon a large scale; the branches may 
be pruned to two or three eyes, or even closer 
than that. The whole of the last season's 
growth may be cut into eyes, that is one with 
half an inch of wood to it. These may be 
potted and placed in moderate bottom heat, 
one in a small pot, or more in larger ones, and 
perhaps a good many in a larger pot would 
be more convenient as regards room. These 
must be kept moist, but not wet, and in the 
course of a few weeks they will begin to grow 
and strike root. They need not be forced 
along too much during the winter, but towards 
the spring they may be potted one in a pot of 
the size forty- eight, and should be set growing 
rather briskly in the stove, and if the tan be 
not too hot, they will be better for plunging ; 
they will soon shoot up, and the side buds as 
they appear should be pinched off, except 
always the three or four nearest the top. 
When the stem is as high as you wish for the 
upright of the standard, which should not be 
less than two feet clear of branches, and may 
be as much more as you please, you pinch 
out the top, but you must bear in mind that 
the side buds are to be rubbed off or pinched 
off as high as you mean the trunk to be to the 
lower branches, and if this be two feet, your 
plant will be nearly three feet high, because 
you are always to leave three or four eyes not 
pinched out above those that you have taken 
away, because they are wanted to form the 
head ; when the top is pinched out the three 
or four side or lateral shoots not pinched out 
will grow fast ; we ought, however, to have 
observed, that from the time they are first 
potted you must keep continually shifting to 
larger pots as fast as the roots reach the sides 
of the one they are in, and the shifts should 
be all larger than one size, for instance, from 
forty-eights you miss thirty-twos and use 
twenty-fours — from twenty-fours to sixteens, 
then to eights, and lastly, to what are variously 
styled by the different potteries, but fifteen to 
eighteen inches across. The progress of the 
plant after the top is taken off is rapid, if the heat 
be genial, and as the season is advancing they 
become more robust. When the lateral shoots 
are three inches long, you may pinch out the 
ends of these in the same way as you did the 
top of the plant ; and now they will each 
throw out other branches, enough to form a 
head; these are to be kept growing until the 
plant flowers, merely taking away any of the 



shoots that are in the way of other shoots, or 
grow in cross ways, or spoil the shape of the 
head. They are not to be stopped any more., 
but be allowed to grow in the stove until they 
are on the eve of blooming, when they may 
be first removed to the coolest place, and then 
into the conservatory, where they will perfect 
their flowers, filling the place with their 
fragrance, which is very powerful, and con- 
tinue to grow and bloom for a long time. The 
other varieties, with their red, orange, and 
yellow flowers, are not of such rapid growth, 
quite, but they require the same treatment. 
They grow best in loam, peat and cow-dung, 
or for want of the latter, the dung from an old 
melon bed, two parts of the first and half a 
part of the two latter ; but this is supposing 
the loam to be what every florist ought to get 
at any cost, the turf from a loamy pasture, 
laid by till it is rotted, the loam is then so 
enriched with vegetable earth that it will grow 
any thing, — but succulents will grow better, as 
well as any thing else, for a little peat earth 
and cow-dung ; should the mixture appear 
too adhesive, which is not very likely, a little 
silver sand will correct it. If the plants are 
designed for the lawn, the most protected 
place must be selected, for the wind is a great 
enemy, the foliage being very large, holds it a 
good deal, and is far easier broken than that of a 
dahlia. Standards are the best any where, 
but it is a common thing to grow the plants 
for out of doors, as you would a dahlia ; let it 
take its own course ; do not pinch out the 
eyes, but let the side branches grow as well as 
the top ones. They should not be planted out 
till the end of June, and they will require 
stakes to support them. The first year the 
plants are sometimes too tender to flourish 
well ; if the winds or the nights be cold they 
appear to receive a check which spoils their 
growth, and they are best, perhaps, continued 
in the house until you observe the bloom buds 
coming small at the base of all the leaves ; 
then they may be hardened off a little in the 
greenhouse, and next planted out in the most 
sheltered of the spots intended to be planted 
with flowers. They may be shifted into a 
larger pot, and plunged in the ground, or put 
out in the open ground without a pot, as the 
cultivator may please. The only thing is, that 
if they are required to be potted up again to 
be kept over the winter, there is less trouble 
when they are plunged in their pots than when 
they have been allowed to ramble without 
bounds. At the end of the season, and pre- 
vious to the frost coming, they should be taken 
up and housed. If there are many they may 
be removed with their balls of earth and 
packed up close together on the ground, allow- 
ing no more water, and when all the leaves 
have fallen they may be cut back, root pruned. 



56S 



TRIPTILION SPINOSUM. 



and potted in fresh soil, gently watered, and 
placed again in the stove, — or the ground at the 
back of 4he pit will do until their buds swell. 
when they may be placed in the light. Very 
little more than the stem should be left when 
they are pruned, because the branches of the 
season are always enough for the head ; by 
cutting all the branches back to two or three 
eyes it enables you to select from the great 
number of new branches those which grow in 
the best direction to form the head handsome, 
and the rest are to be removed close with a 
sharp knife. There is nothing to do after- 
wards this season but to let them grow, just 
checking the exuberance of any unruly 
branch that becomes conspicuously vigorous. 
Those plants which are bloomed in the house 
are merely removed when past their beauty 
to some place where they will be least in the 
way, and when they drop their leaves they are 
pruned and kept rather dry, until the grow- 
ing time comes again. We have confined 
our remarks to the Datura arborea, — but 
although Ave have done so, sangiritiea (bicolor), 
and hctea will do well with the same treat- 
ment, although rather different in habit, and 
totally different in the shape and colour of their 
flowers. JD. arborea has very large funnel- 
shaped flowers, with a bold handsome open 
mouth ; and the double white is a good 
deal like it ; but the other two are tubular, 
with a slightly enlarged and turned up limb ; 
the bloom is about the same length, but the 
same size all the way down the tube, and 
the lip very little enlarged and turned out, 
showing a small portion of the inner surface. 
It has been said there is a difference in the 
degrees of hardness, but we have had all four 
varieties under the same treatment, answering 
equally well; but we have found the blooms 
always more abundant from a matured plant 
than from the first year's, although they bloom 
the first year from an eye very well. They 
are ill -growing plants if not annually at- 
tended to in the pruning, which is as requisite 
to the Daturas as to any plants we know, for 
they would grow confused and unmanageable, 
too thick with branches, weakly, and perhaps j 
scarcely throw a bloom where there ought to 
be a dozen. There must be some pains taken 
to keep them from the red spider ; but this 
applies to all the plants in the stove, and what 
will cure one will cure another, but uniform 
heat, occasional moisture, sulphur and water 
now and then sprinkled on the pipes, and if 
necessary syringed under the leaves of the 
plant, will prevent this. Red spider, however, 
rarely does mischief; the plant, when neg- 
lected, is subject to it, and it may be looked 
upon rather as the effect of bad health than 
the cause. It is no use cleaning a plant unless 
it be got into health ajrain. 




TEIPTIIIOX SPINOSUM. 
{Euiz and Pavon.) 

THE SPIXV TRIPTILION. 

This is an uncommon plant, though it has 
been for some years introduced. It is, never- 
theless, a plant of very considerable beauty, so 
that its rarity must be attributed either to 
the difficulty attending its cultivation, or to 
the slow means of propagation which it 
affords. Both these causes have, probably, 
had some share in limiting its cultivation ; 
for, on the one hand, though cultivable, it is 
decidedly one of those which are commonly 
called " shy growing," or " miffy " plants ; 
and, on the other, it does not afford such 
facilities for propagation as is usually met 
with in herbaceous perennials, to which class 
of subjects it belongs. We must, however, 
recommend it to more extended notice, for 
the colour of its gay and brilliant blossoms 
can scarcely be dispensed with among pot 
plants required to bloom during summer, and 
their permanence is a great additional re- 
commendation. The following remarks, it is 
hoped, will serve to do away, in some mea- 
sure, with the difficulties which have been 
supposed to hang around its cultivation. 

As already remarked, it is a perennial her- 
baceous plant, attaining, when full grown, 
about the height of two feet. It has a 
thickish fleshy root, somewhat in the way of 
those of the dahlia, but altogether smaller. 
The stems are numerous, slender, decumbent, 
and flexuose, and everywhere clothed with 
hairs. The leaves are of two kinds ; the 
root leaves, that is, those which proceed at 
once from the crown of the plant, are pin- 
natifid, and spring up in autumn after the 
flowering stems have died and been removed, 



TRIPTILION SPINOSUM.

remaining during winter, and perishing either 
in great part, or altogether, before the plant 
again reaches its blooming condition ; the 
stem leaves are mostly very deeply cut and 
jagged ; irregularly placed along the stem, 
and without stalks, the segments as well as the 
point of the leaf being armed with a long stiff 
spinous point. The flowers grow at the top 
of the stems in densely crowded fasciculated 
corymbs ; they are syngenesious, or composite, 
and each consist of five two-lipped florets, 
the outer lip of a most beautiful and enduring 
blue colour, and the inner lip small and 
yellow ; these florets are arranged so as to 
form a small roundish " flower," as it would 
be popularly called, but more properly a 
" capitulum," or flower head, for each of the 
five florets are equivalent to the parts which 
in other plants are understood as individual 
flowers. Sometimes, in the case of cultivated 
plants, these flowers are succeeded by seeds, 
but usually seeds are but sparingly produced. 

The present plant has a considerable geo- 
graphical range, being found near Valparaiso, 
the city of Conception, and as far south as 
between Valdivia and Osoro, in fields and 
plains. It is a great favourite with the in- 
habitants of Chili, on account of the enduring 
colour of its blossoms ; they term it, Siem- 
previva, and employ it extensively for orna- 
mental purposes. It was first raised in 
England in 1827, by Mr. Frost, gardener to 
the Countess of Grenville, at Dropmore, but 
had previously been known for a long time to 
Botanists. It blooms about the month of 
July. Besides the name here adopted, it has 
been called Naussauvia spinosa (Don), and 
Triptilion laciniatum (Willdenow). 

The greatest difficulty in the artificial culti- 
vation of this plant lies in its safe preserva- 
tion during the winter, not, however, so much 
from the effects of cold, (for it will bear 
even some degrees of frost without injury,) as 
from the effects of the dampness and close- 
ness of the atmosphere, which at that season 
is more or less felt by all delicate plants. The 
effort required, therefore, is to keep it from 
what is technically termed " damping off," 
that is, becoming mouldy and decayed. To 
have a fair chance the grower should com- 
mence with a strong and healthy plant. After 
the flowers and their stems have decayed, the 
plants should be repotted ; they should be 
taken out of the pots they have been kept in, 
the old soil partially removed with great care 
from among their roots, and then repotted 
into as small a pot as the size of the plant 
and the number of roots may allow ; 
three- inch pots would in most cases be large 
enough, unless, indeed, the plants form — for 
so rare a subject — very large masses : the 
soil used should be sandy loam, mixed with 



about a third of good clean leaf -mould ; the 
pots must be well drained, with a large crock, 
and an inch or more of smaller ones, covered 
with a little rough leaf-mould. The plants 
should be potted rather high in the pot, that 
is, their base should be nearly level with the 
rim of the pot, the soil sloping slightly to the 
outer edge. After this potting, which will 
take place in September, the plants must be 
set in a cool dry frame, where they may be shel- 
tered from rains, and in due time from night 
cold, but they need not be kept very close, so 
that they are protected in these respects. In 
October remove them to a front shelf, near 
the light, in a cool greenhouse, where they 
may get air whenever it is admitted. This 
is safer than a pit, although, if they can be 
secured from damp and severe frosts, a pit 
will preserve them equally well. Continue 
this till spring advances. During all this 
time water them very carefully ; take care to 
let them become moderately dry — not so dry 
as to droop — before a fresh supply is given, 
and then give them just enough to thoroughly 
moisten the soil, and see that it drains readily 
away. In spring, when these begin to grow 
freely, they may be shifted into pots a little 
larger, still very carefully watering them, and 
keeping them in a light airy position. As 
summer draws on, the lower leaves are apt to 
perish, which is probably owing, in some 
measure, to the dry hot atmosphere to which 
they are then exposed : at this period, there- 
fore, a cool frame would certainly be prefera- 
ble for them, in which they may be shaded 
during the hottest part of the day, and the 
material they stand on sprinkled, so as to 
keep them cool ; at night, and at all other 
times, they should have abundance of air. If 
the pots get full of roots— not else — before 
the blossoms are much advanced, they may 
have a larger pot ; but a five-inch pot will be 
large enough for a plant of considerable age 
and strength. We should, however, recom- 
mend the plants to be grown in considerable 
masses, instead of being too frequently divided 
into a number of smaller plants, the effect of 
the larger specimens being infinitely prefera- 
ble to that of small puny scraps. 

Propagation may be effected by division of 
the plant as mentioned above; and this should 
be done early in the autumn, or as socn after 
flowering as possible, in order that the plants 
may get well established before winter : these 
plants would subsequently require the treat- 
ment already sketched out. Whenever seeds 
are produced, they should be sown as soon as 
ripe enough, in pots of sandy soil, and placed 
in a close pit or hot-bed to induce speedy ger- 
mination. The young plants, as soon as 
fairly developed, should be transplanted singly 
into small pots, using very light sandy soil ; 



570 



NOTES ON FLOWERS. 



and they must be kept in the same place until 
they are fairly established, when they should 
be gradually brought to bear the treatment of 
older plants, being shifted into larger pots 
when requisite, and kept during winter in a 
dry part of the greenhouse. In the spring 
they may receive the treatment of mature 
plants. Both these means of increase are, 
however, very tardy. 

The plant is stated to be intensely bitter ; 
and to prove a valuable remedial agent in many 
diseases — we presume in its native country. 




THE HOLLY TREE. 

"We are so accustomed to see the Holly 
growing as a scrubby bush, either in the 
hedge-row, or among thick masses of shrubs, 
that the idea of a Holly tree is in general not 
very distinctly impressed on the mind. And 
yet among the smaller trees, there is scarcely 
one so beautiful as the Holly when old enough 
to display itself in this character, and standing 
alone, so as to assume its own proper mode of 
growth. 

The prickly character of the evergreen 
foliage of the common Holly is well known. It 
sometimes happens that when the plant has 
been allowed to assume the arborescent habit, 
the upper leaves are for the most part either 
entirely without prickles except that of their 
mucronated apex, or are much less prickly 
than ordinary. This has given rise to some 
very elegant lines of Southey's, which are well 
known. The image of the poet is however 
rather a constrained one, inasmuch as the 
foundation upon which it is built is not con- 
stant. Something of this kind of habit may 
however often be observed. 

Speaking of this tree, Evelyn in his Sylca 
observes : — " Above all the natural greens 
which enrich our home-born store, there is 



none certainly to be compared to the Agri- 
folium, or Acuifolium rather, our Holly [Ilex 
Aquifolium'], insomuch that I have often won- 
der'd at our curiosity after foreign plants, and 
expensive difficulties, to the neglect of the 
culture of this vulgar but incomparable tree, 
whether we will propagate it for use and de- 
fence, or for sight and ornament." " The 
timber of the Holly (besides that it is the 
whitest of all hard woods, and therefore us'd 
by the In-layer especially under thin plates of 
Ivory to render it more conspicuous) is for all 
sturdy purposes ; the millwright, turner, and 
engraver prefer it to any other." 

"We recommend the Holly to be more fre- 
quently planted as a tree in the conspicuous 
parts of lawns, shrubberies, and pleasure 
grounds, either singly, or in combination with 
others to form a group. It will grow in 
almost any soil and situation, but prefers a 
loamy soil.

meae. — A very handsome shrub of the larger 
order, that is to say, growing several feet 
high ; at Kew, plants five years old and five 
feet high, have blossomed freely. The plant 
is everywhere covered with a glaucous white 
powdery substance, and the young branches are 
four-sided : the leaves are numerous, opposite, 
elliptic-ovate, or cordate, three to four inches

two feet high, furnished in the lower part with 
long narrow sword-shaped leaves, arranged in 
two rows, and in the upper part becoming 
branched into a largish panicle. The flowers 
are of a very striking rich deep orange 
colour, and are produced abundantly; they 
consist of a slender tube about three-fourths 
of an inch in length, with a limb of six oblong 
segments, expanding widely, the three outer 
segments being somewhat the smallest ; from 
the centre of the flowers project the three long 
stamens, and the three-cleft style. Native of 
Caffraria, in the colony of the Cape of Good 
Hope. Introduced in 1844 by Mr. James 
Backhouse. Flowers in the latter part of 
summer. Culture. — Half-hardy, a splendid 
plant for a bed in the flower-garden, the co- 
lour being rich and rare ; turfy peat and 
sandy loam ; propagated bv offsets from the 
roots. (271) 

Dendrobidji cretaceuji, Lindley (chalk- 
white Dendrobe). — Orchidaceae § Malaxeas- 
Dendrobidaa. — A neat and distinct epiphytal 
species, with slender stems, and thin lance- 
shaped leaves, the flowers growing from the 
mature naked stems opposite where the leaves 
had been ; they are produced singly, although 
the plant is stationed in a group of the genus 
which is said to have the flowers in pairs, or 
in threes. The blossoms are remarkable for 
their dull chalky whiteness, the tip being, 
however, elegantly pencilled with crimson ; 



the sepals and petals are lance-shaped, and the 
hood-like lip is covered inside and outside with 
short close white fur. Native of India — Moul- 
mein, Mergui, and the Khasiya hills. Intro- 
duced in 1840. Flowers in July. Culture. 
— Requires a stove ; turfy peat soil ; propa- 
gated by dividing the plant. (272) 

Iris aurea, Lindley (golden Iris). — Iri- 
daceae. — A herbaceous perennial plant, having 
the habit of and some affinity to Iris ochro- 
leuca. It has sword-shaped leaves, and pro- 
duces several blossoms at the top of the stems; 
they are of a deep golden yellow colour, and 
have a showy character. Native of India 
[North ?] ; raised by Messrs. "Whitley and 
Osborn of Fulham, from Indian seeds, pre- 
sented to them by Dr. Royle. Introduced in 
1841. Flowers in July. Culture. — Hardy; 
common garden soil ; propagated by dividing 
the plants. (273) 

Vanda tricolor, Lindley (three-coloured 
Vanda). — Orchidaceas § Vandeae-Sarcan- 
thidaa. — A handsome epiphytal species, with 
long strap-shaped, distichous grooved foliage, 
and bearing lateral racemes of a few large 
handsome flowers, the sepals and petals of 
which are greenish-yellow, dotted and blotched 
with cinnamon-brown, and the lip rose- 
coloured, its lateral lobes being rounded and 
colourless. It has the habit of Vanda Rox- 
burghii, and is still nearer related to Vanda 
Hindsii, a species of New Guinea not yet in 
cultivation. Native of Java. Introduced in 
1845. Flowers in the autumn. Culture. — 
Requires a moist stove ; to be attached to a 
block of wood, or planted in an open basket, 
and suspended ; propagated by division of the 
plant. (274) 

0D0NT0GL0SSUMMAxiLLARE,i^c?Zt-?/ (maxil- 
lae-lipped Toothtongue). — Orchidaceas § Van- 
deaa-Brassidaa. — A beautiful epiphytal plant, 
which might be readily mistaken for Odont. 
Cervantesii, which it much resembles in its 
blossoms. The sepals are acutely lance-shaped, 
the petals broader, blotched with red on a 
white ground ; the base of the lip is similarly 
marked. The present plant is known by a 
very large yellow appendage, which is seated 
at the base of the lip. Supposed to be a 
native of Mexico. Introduced about 1846. 
Flowers in September. Culture. — Requires 
a cool stove ; turfy peat soil ; propagated by 
division of the plant. (275.) 

Eria convallarioides, var. major (large 
close-headed Eria). — Orchidaceae § Malaxeaa- 
Dendrobidaa. — This variety is much handsomer 
than the original species. It has a compressed 
stem, bearing at top three or four oblong 
lance-shaped leaves, beneath which are situ- 
ated the dense drooping racemes of small 
white flowers. Native of India. Introduced 
about 1844 ? Flowers in — ? Culture. — ■

INGA PULCHERRIMA. 



573 




INGA PULCHERRIMA. 

The plant known in our gardens as the Inga 
pulcherrima is allied to the Mimosas, and 
Acacias, many species of which are well known 
to be highly ornamental either in their foliage 
or blossoms. The Ingas — at least many of 
them, and our present subject among the num- 
ber — are if possible still more ornamental than 
Mimosas or Acacias, in consequence of their 
more highly coloured flowers. Our present 
subject belongs to a group separated from the 
genus Inga, and named Calliandra, which 
literally signifies " beautiful stamens," and is 
exceedingly appropriate to these plants, whose 
very beautiful blossoms appear to consist en- 
tirely of tufts of coloured threads, the con- 
spicuous portion being, in fact, the stamens in 
a high state of development. 

The cut introduced at the head of these 
remarks will give a very good idea of the 
general appearance of the plant, which is a 
shrub, in habit not very much branched. The 
light and elegant twice-pinnate leaves will at 
once be understood ; but our artist has not 
been so successful in representing the blos- 
soms : these, in fact, consist as already inti- 
mated of several little tufts of fine rich scarlet 
threads or stamens, collected into drooping 
tassel-like heads, whose size, outline, and 
position are shown sufficiently in the cut. In 
its general characteristics, this plant bears 
considerable resemblance to the Inga (or 
Calliandra) kermesina. 

The Inga pulcherrima is recorded as a native 
of Mexico, and is said to have been introduced 
to this country in 1822. The flowers are 



produced in winter and the early part of 
spring. 

In its cultivation it requires a lightish soil, 
composed of equal parts of turfy peat and 
loam, with an admixture of sand to render it 
open ; the soil should be rough and free, the 
pots moderate-sized, and well drained. After 
flowering, it should be cut in a little if neces- 
sary, repotted, and set to grow in a moist 
stove heat, but not in too confined a part of 
the stove ; in this position it may be kept till 
it has formed good shoots, or say till about 
May or June. During the summer season, 
and through the early part of the autumn, they 
should be placed in a greenhouse temperature, 
where their growth will become arrested and 
the plants gradually ripened, and they will be 
brought to a state of inactivity and repose, 
which will prepare them for the development 
of their blossoms, and impart to them the 
energy requisite to produce vigorous growth 
afterwards. 

The irritability which is observed in vari- 
ous species of Mimosae, and which is familiar 
to almost every one in the case of the com- 
mon annual sensitive plant {Mimosa pudica, 
and M~. sensiliva), is in a slight degree pre- 
sent in the Inga pulcherrima when it is grow- 
ing in a warm atmosphere ; under these 
circumstances, if the young leaves are roughly 
pressed, or exposed to a strong current of 
air, or a depression of temperature, the leaf- 
lets contract and fold together, soon after- 
wards expanding and attaining their usual 
position. In the greenhouse, even in the 
brightest and warmest days of winter, the 
leaflets do not become at all expanded. 

The Ingas belong as already intimated to 
that group of the natural order Leguminaceaa, 
which includes the Acacias, Mimosas, and 
allied plants ; this group is technically called 
Mimosas. 

PINE APPLES IN THE OPEN AIR. 

Mr. Barnes, of Bicton, has tried the ex- 
periment of placing some pine plants out in 
the kitchen garden at that place. This was 
done in May, the ground being prepared by 



i74 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



digging out the soil as for celery trenches, the 
soil thrown out forming a back right and left 
for shelter ; the trenches were filled in with 
old hot-bed material, chiefly leaves, among 
which the pots were plunged ; the whole sur- 
face, banks and all, was then covered with a 
layer two inches thick of charred straw. The 
plants had blossomed and the fruit was set 
before they were put out. Mr. Barnes states 
that after they were put out, the weather took 
an unfavourable turn, and of some of the 
flowers which had not been set in-doors, the 
pips became " blind," causing the fruit to be 
somewhat deformed. The points of the leaves 
also received some injury from the unfavour- 
ableness of the weather ; but as soon as the 
latter became kind they recovered. Their 
suckers were very strong, and though some- 
what browned at the points of the outside 
leaves, were healthy ; the roots too were of 
the most healthy description. It having been 
considered by some that Devonshire was 
peculiarly favourable to this experiment, Mr. 
Barnes thought it worth while to keep a 
register of the temperature of the kitchen 
garden where the experiment was made ; this 
register was somewhat deficient, inasmuch as 
it did not commence till the loth of June ; it 
was continued on till September. During the 
months in which the experiment was made, 
the warmest day — the loth of July — indicated 
96° at noon, and the coldest — the 23d of 
August — '18° night. The fruit generally 
swelled tolerably well, and the quality has 
been stated to be excellent. The plants ex- I 
perimented on were chiefly Queens, but there i 
were some Jamaica?, Envilles, Sugar-loafs, j 
&c. This experiment is of course altogether 
different from cultivating the pine-apple in 
the open air ; and few persons will, notwith- 
standing Mr. Barnes's register, be disposed to 
think that Devonshire was not by its climate ; 
peculiarly adapted to produce the result which i 
he attained. 

TRUFFLE CULTURE. 

Mr. Tilleet, of "Welbeck, has recorded his 
success in cultivating the Truffle (Gard. '. 
Journ. 1847, 81). He found, in trying its j 
artificial cultivation, that young ones trans- I 
planted invariably perished. Those, however, ! 
which were full sized, and in a state of ripe- 
ness, with all the soil attached in which they ' 
grew, communicated their spawn to the place j 
where they were planted, and thus a colony 
was founded. This was in natural soil in a 
shrubbery, under thorns, yews, and laurels. 
Mr. Tillery made up an artificial bed in 1844, 
under some beech trees, in a sandy soil ; it was ■ 
filled up with muddy deposit full of fresh-water 
shells from the bottom of a lake j this bed was 



planted with some old decaying truffles, and 
the parings of those used in the kitchen, and 
there were, in January 1847, young truffles 
found as large as walnuts. Mr. Tillery adds 
the following hints as the result of his expe- 
rience :— » The situation must be where there 
is due light and shade, such as under young 
oaks, thorns, or crab-trees, or beech, where 
the trees stand singly. The soil must be 
neither too wet nor too dry, and should be 
covered slightly with grass or leaves, to keep 
it from cracking in dry weather — if it does so, 
in the least, they all perish. The finest and 
best grow from one and a half to two inches 
below the surface. The original soil may be 
taken out eighteen inches deep, and a large 
stone placed at each corner to mark the bed ; 
then filled in with calcareous soil mixed with 
small stones, pieces of chalk, marl, or shells 
of any sort. October and November are the 
best months for planting, as the ripe ones are 
most plentiful then. The ripe truffles for 
planting, should be taken up with the original 
soil about them, and not disturbed in the 
least.

ASD ORIGINAL NOTES CONNECTED "WITH HORTICrLTERE 
AND NATURAL HISTORY. 

CoxsTsrciiON of Venteeies. — Mr. R. Beid 
has described an arrangement for introducing 
vines planted outside, into the vinery, which 
he had seen in the garden of Mr. Nash, of 
Bishop's Stortford. The house was con- 
structed as vineries usually are, except that a 
board six or eight inches wide is fixed on the 
wad plate, projecting over the border ; and 
the front sashes instead of hanging perpen- 
dicularly when shut, rest on the boards and 
present an external appearance of being open 
six inches for the admission of air. There 
are pieces of board fixed on the munnions each 
side of the sash, of the same width at bottom 
as the board above referred to, tapering to 
nothing at top, and fitted with a rebate for the 
sash to drop into. The border is made quite 
up to the wall plate, and the vines introduced 
through holes in the boards. Mr. Beid 
thought it an admirable contrivance for facili- 
tating the taking of vines out of the house, 
which might be done with still greater facility 
if instead of the hole in the board a notch was 
made in the front. Mr. Nash attached im- 
portance to the vines being allowed to grow 
up straight, instead of being cramped, as they 
usually are, in holes through the brickwork. 
The vines at this place have this year pro- 
duced an unexampled crop of grapes. 

Hothouse beildevg. — A correspondent of 
the Gardener's Chronicle writes : — " When 
my attention was first directed to sheet glass, 
I was tempted to pay Is. 4d. per foot for it,

in London. I found in my greenhouse, at 11 
r.M., 15° difference between the bottom and 
top of the house (the house was glazed with 
small squares), and the question occurred, how 
could I equalize the temperature. Sheet glass, 
and glass air-tight for the bottom lights would, 

I imagined, effect the desideratum, and, as I 
afterwards found, I had calculated rightly ; 
for, by having the bottom lights so glazed, at 

II p.m. the thermometers have indicated equal 
temperatures ever since, and of the good 
effects of this on grapes I have had abundant 
proof." 

Substitute for glass. — In the Revue 
Scientifique et Industrielle, it is stated that 
Prof. Schonbein, who invented the gun-cotton, 
has discovered a material which is equivalent 
to malleable glass. He renders papier machee 
transparent, by causing it to undergo a certain 
metamorphosis, which he calls Catalytic. Of 
this material he forms window-panes, vases, 
bottles, &c. perfectly impermeable to water, 
perfectly transparent, and not at all brittle like 
glass. Whether it will prove useful for gar- 
den purposes remains to be seen. 

Border yellow Turnip. — This variety of 
turnip is strongly recommended by Mr. 
Drewett, Sir W. Heathcote's gardener, as a 
vegetable of excellent quality and very hardy, 
and therefore well suited for a winter crop 
(Gard. Journ. 1847, 197). A sample of this 
kind, also called the red-top hybrid, sown in 
July 1846, stood unharmed through the 
winter of 1846-7 ; and when sown about that 
time — (July or August) — it does not grow 
beyond the size of ordinary garden turnips. 

Amherstia nobilis. — This splendid plant, 
described by Dr. Wallich as " profusely orna- 
mented with pendulous racemes of large ver- 
milion-coloured blossoms, unequalled in the 
Flora of the East Indies, and perhaps not sur- 
passed in magnificence and elegance in any 
part of the world," is about to enrich the col- 
lections at Kew and Windsor, Captain Munro 
having recently brought to this country no 
less than five plants in good condition. The 
only plant in the country previously was at 
Chatsworth. The tree is represented to be 
like the laburnum, but foliage and flowers 
three times the size ; the latter comparable 
with those of Erythrina Crista-galli. 

Apios tuberosa. — This plant has been re- 
commended to be cultivated for culinary pur- 
poses in aid of the potato crops ; the tuberous 
roots, which grow in strings like beads, Mr. 
E. A. Hamp finds to be sweet and good in a 
cooked state. They are not, however, nearly 
equal to the potato, and as the latter plant 
stands in a more promising condition than it 
recently did, as regards future cultivation, it 
is not likely the Apios will be much cultivated. 
It may, however, be grown for variety. 



Rhubarb buds. — These have been recom- 
mended for tarts ; being taken just as they 
are emerging, and so as to thin the plantation 
where too thick,- Their use has, however, in 
some cases, been followed by serious sickness 
and illness ; and as the plant contains much 
oxalic acid, they can hardly be recommended. 

Lilium lancifolium. — These magnificent 
plants have now been proved to be perfectly 
hardy, and may be regarded as indispensable 
ornaments of the flower-garden as well as the 
conservatory in the autumnal months. Mr. 
Groom, of Clapham Rise, sent two plants to 
the meeting of the Horticultural Society in 
September, each a single stem, bearing up- 
wards of forty flower-buds. They had been 
lifted out of the open border, where the bulbs 
had been planted in the common garden soil, 
well broken up, but not manured — manure 
being considered unnecessary in the culture of 
the lily— -in the end of November 1845, in a 
bed, at fifteen inches asunder, and covered 3| 
inches deep with light soil. They were not 
protected in winter in any way ; but after the 
stems died down, the soil was carefully re- 
moved down to the bulbs, and replaced by 
fresh material. The flowers were better 
coloured than those produced in a greenhouse. 
Now that these Japan lilies have been ascer- 
tained to be hardy, they must become great 
favourites for out-door decoration in autumn. 
Mr. Groom has also raised some fine new 
varieties from seed. 

Meudon Pine-apples. — A queen pine- 
apple, grown at Meudon, and sent to the 
editor of the Gardener's Chronicle, is re- 
ported to have weighed eight pounds when 
cut, and to have been in form, crown, colour, 
symmetry, and fragrance, faultless, but in 
flavour worthless. M. Pelvilain, the gardener 
at Meudon, adopts the method of planting out 
into a bed of soil — peat, very like English peat., 
sandy and fibrous, containing rather less iron 
and more lime than Wimbledon peat. A 
smart bottom heat is kept up by the agency 
of stable dung. The bad flavour is alleged 
to be the result of insufficient airing. M. 
Pelvilain transplants his plants into the fruit- 
ing pit when they approach maturity, and 
adopts the maiden-plant system, in contradis- 
tinction from Mr. Hamilton, who retains the 
old stocks for an unlimited period. The 
Meudon plants are always kept in pots in the 
winter ; they are all planted out the first 
summer, and are fruited either in pots or 
planted out in the second summer. 

Vegetable parasitism. — M. Decaisne has 
discovered that Melampyrum, Pedicularis, 
Odontites, and other Rhinanthaceous plants, 
are in reality parasites, deriving their support 
from the roots of the herbage among which 
they grow. This seems to explain the reason 



576 



CONTEMPORARY WRITINGS. 



why they are uncultivable. It is a singular 
physiological fact, that all these parasites are 
found to be destitute of medullary rays. Prof. 
Henslow has corroborated M. Decaisne as 
regards the parasitism of the Odontites. De- 
caisne thought, from some analogy of struc- 
ture, that the Sundews would also prove to 
be parasitical on sphagnum, but this seems to 
be opposed to further experience. Another 
well-known plant, unsuspected as a parasite, 
has been pointed out to be such by W. Mitten, 
Esq. ; this is the Thesium linophyllum, whose 
parasitical attachment to leguminous, labiate, 
umbelliferous, composite, and gramineous 
plants, Mr. Mitten has noted. 
" Influence of Light on Vegetation. — 
Signor Zantedeschi, an Italian philosopher, in 
investigating the subject of the influence of 
light, refracted through coloured glasses, on 
the vegetation of plants and the germination 
of seeds, found that every coloured ray is more 
or less injurious to the vegetation of all vege- 
tables; more or less, because the influence is 
not equal on all species of plants. He also 
found by his experiments, that the coloured 
rays of light exercise a beneficial influence on 
the germination of seeds, promoting their 
development. 

DoxENNi d'ete pear. — This is a hand- 
some early pear, with the characters of the 
Doyenne as regards the eye, the segments of 
the calyx, and the thick stalk ; but differing 
essentially in having a soft skin, partially 
coloured with deep red. The flesh is whitish, 
tender, juicy, rich and refreshing, free from 



the disagreeable musky flavour which many 
early pears possess. It commences to ripen 
from the 10th to the 20th of July. It is a 
prodigious bearer. Mr. Rivers of Sawbridge- 
worth states that trees on quince-stocks only 
three feet high have borne this season from 
two to three dozen each. In this variety the 
shoots are clear, olive-yellow, with pale 
brown dots ; leaves elliptic, tapering regularly 
to the point ; the petioles long and slender ; 
the colour of the fruit pale green, streaked on 
the exposed side with deep red. It will form 
a very agreeable addition to the early varie- 
ties already in cultivation. The Doyenne 
d'ete, according to M. Poiteau, has been cul- 
tivated for many years at Nantes ; though, 
till lately, but little known at Paris. It is 
stated in Le Bon Jardinier, that it was in- 
troduced into the nurseries at Paris by M. 
Noisette, in 1830. From various resem- 
blances, it appears likely that it may have 
sprung from the Bellissime d'ete, or Jargo- 
nelle of the French, which is a very different 
pear from the English Jargonelle. 



The Frontispiece. The following are the 
names of the plants which are represented in 
the frontispiece : — Tropseolum speciosum, red ; 
Berberis ilicifolia, orange; Pentstemon Gor- 
doni, pale blue ; and Pleroma elegans, purple. 
These are all of recent introduction, and are 
fully described in the present and preceding 
volumes of the Annals of Horticulture.
