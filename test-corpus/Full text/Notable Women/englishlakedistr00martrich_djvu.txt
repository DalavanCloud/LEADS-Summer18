PREFACE 

TO THE FIRST EDITION. 



Now that the work is just ready to appear, I am thankful 
to him [the Publisher] for the opportunity of saying in this 
prefatory page, with what pride and pleasure I have looked 
over the accessories and embellishments with which, by his 
zeal and spirit, and by the admirable co-operation he has 
been so fortunate to secure, my humble work is elevated 
to a quality of real importance. ^ ^ * If my 
gratitude to my coadjutors causes me to overrate the product 
of our labours, I shall not at least be mistaken in saying 
that we have all done our best to set forth a true present- 
ment of the land we love, in the hope of inducing and 
enabling those who live in town or plain to know and love 
it as we do. If any think that we have painted it too fair, 
and that we love it fanatically, let them come and see. 

H. MARTINEAU.

THE RAILWAY APPROACHES. 

The mountain-region of Cumberland and Westmorland and that 
part of the County of Lancashire which lies north of the Sands 
and embraces the fair and wealthy region of Furness, has for its 
nucleus the cluster of tall mountains of which Scawfell is the 
highest. There are the loftiest peaks and deepest valleys. 
These are surrounded by somewhat lower ridges and shallower 
vales ; and these again by others, till the uplands are mere hills 
and the valleys scarcely sunk at all. It is into these exterior 
undulations that the railways penetrate. If the time should 
ever come when iron roads intersect the mountainous parts of 
Westmorland and Cumberland, that time is not yet, loud as have 
been the lamentations of some residents.* It is a great thing 
that steam can convey travellers round the outskirts of the dis- 
trict, and up to its openings. These openings are numerous ; 
and we therefore give a few hints as regards the Lines and the 
points at which passengers are deposited. This will be much 
facilitated by reference to our Maps and * Bradshaw.' 

The *XSMantl * Railway, (as viewed by the traveller from the 
south or east), makes its inroad into our precincts, by sending out 
its long arm (The * Furness' Line) from Carnforth, stretching 
over Morecambe Bay and round the lower hills to the foot of 
Winandermere. As the name of this railway implies, it passes 
through the midst of England, on its route northward from St. 

* Mr. Wordsworth, the late poet laureate, remonstrated against the 
intrusion of the railway.

Pancras Station, London. Besides the Metropolis itself, the 
cities and towns of Bedford, Northampton, Cambridge, Leices- 
ter, Birmingham, Worcester, Cheltenham, Lincoln, Peterborough, 
Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield, Rotherham, Wakefield, Leeds, 
Bradford, and Skipton, send their inhabitants to Lakeland by 
this Line. The traveller passes through some of the towns and 
sees important manufactures carried on close by the train. 
Sheffield and Leeds are perhaps the most remarkable examples. 
Here are innumerable furnaces, with tongues of flame stretching 
out greedily, one thinks, to set on fire the whole neighbourhood ; 
there is a perfect forest of gigantic chimneys, — monuments of 
manufacturing industry ; and there also are the factories them- 
selves, some of which are of mighty proportions and, by their 
beautiful architecture, suggest palaces rather than workshops. 
Witness also, about Leeds, the wilderness of railway-carriages, 
engines, and other vehicles, giving but faint idea of the enormous 
traffic to and from this wonderful focus of lines. The train glides 
steadily through, however, with huge mills and machine-works on 
either hand. When the open country is again reached, here, by 
the very side of the railway, we see quarried the beautiful free- 
stone of the region, which, besides supplying the demands of the 
locality, is conveyed hundreds of miles to form the important fea- 
tures of our best buildings. Now the railway runs in a fertile 
valley, and a fair view is obtained of the ruins of Kirkstall Abbey. 
Higher up, on the slope, are the estates, homes, and mansions 
of the wealthy of the neighbourhood, — such a panorama of the 
kind as we have seen from no other railway. At Keighley we 
are within three and a-half miles of Haworth, where dwelt the 
three Brontes in the rectory of their father, and between here 
and our destination the famous and most interesting Cave-dis- 
trict of Ingleborough is passed, which has been very graphically 
described by Mr. Payn in his ' Leaves from Lakeland.' Carn- 
forth, with its large iron-works, is soon reached by our express 
train ; then Morecambe Bay, which the railway crosses by some 
marvellous engineering works, before reaching Grange, a thriv- 
ing, and the traveller will say, as he views it from the carriage- 
window, attractive spot. Indeed, we may say, in passing, that 



we know of no sea-side resort which has, besides its first attrac- 
tions, rock, hill, and charming woodland in such abundance and 
variety as ' Grange-over-Sands/ We shall, of course, have to 
visit it after our devotions have been paid to the peerless lakes. 
For many miles we have the sea as our close companion ; now 
we cross its bays, now we skirt the shore ; then the hills begin 
to rise about us, the foliage to thicken, even the rugged rocks 
which are peeping out seem to bid us welcome ; and so, after a 
short tunnel or two, we are brought face to face with the * Queen 
of the Lakes/ It is true she is tame here ; but, as a general 
rule, lakes should be approached from the foot, that the ridges 
may rise, rather than sink, before the observer's eye. The 
steamer is alongside the station, waiting our arrival ; we step on 
board and in a few minutes are steaming on our northward 
course. Fell Foot, on our right, is a charming residence ; and 
about us, on the water, are numerous sailing, steaming, and row- 
ing boats indicating the occupant's aquatic tastes. Between this 
and Storrs, is the least interesting part of Winandermere, a dis- 
tance of about four miles ; but it is everywhere beautiful and 
will, even here, give great pleasure to the eye fresh from scenes 
less fair. We shall have to revert to Storrs and its memories in 
a future page ; also to the Ferry Hotel and its surroundings. 
Meantime the visitor may very distinctly note from the deck of 
the steamer the road climbing the hill behind the latter, which is 
the nearest way to Esthwaite Water and Coniston. Now we 
skirt the south-eastern margin of Belle Isle, and almost immedi- 
ately turn sharply upon the busy scene in Bowness Bay. The 
steamer winds its way through the smaller craft, and we are de- 
deposited on the landing-stage. Whether our destination be 
Bowness or Windermere Village, abundant means of transit will 
be found. The latter is a mile and a-half distant ; but the two 
are so intimately connected, that it will best answer the purpose 
of this book if they are taken as one, which certainly they shortly 
will be if building continues at its present rate in the gap be- 
ween them. Our ' Midland' tourist, then, has arrived either at 
Bowness or Windermere, and will look for further instructions 
at a future page. 



4 ^ailbjag ^^pproari&es, 

<^0nfst0n is reached by the Midland and Furness Lines ; and 
325? astinater is only seven miles from Drigg Station on the latter 
railway ; but the number of tourists entering the district from 
these latter points is inconsiderable. 

The * Jlionbon ant( 'Jg^ort^f "^M'estetn * was the first to 

reach the Lake Country (in the year 1847) and consequently its 
matured connections, in and about the district, make it a most 
desirable route. Since that time Windermere, at the terminus 
of the railway, a place rapidly rising to the dimensions of a town, 
has been built, and from thence run Coaches and other public 
conveyances which penetrate almost every part of the region. 

In coming from London (Euston Station), we pass through 
the bright sunny fields of Hertfordshire and away on to Rugby, 
part of the town being visible on the left ; Stafford, Crewe (the 
depot of the Company for locomotives, &c., in the construction 
and repair of which a large portion of the {)opulation is em- 
ployed) ; Warrington ; Wigan (an important coal-field) ; Preston 
(cotton manufactures) ; Lancaster ; Kendal (famous for its rail- 
way rugs, horse-cloths, &c.) ; and then up the Valley of the 
Kent to the hills. The train is pulled up before reaching the 
terminus, and here the traveller gets his first peep of the river- 
lake. If he be going to Bowness (a mile and a-half distant), 
by the margin of the lake, carriages, omnibusses, coaches, and 
other vehicles are waiting to convey him to his destination ; other- 
wise, this new Village of Windermere, standing on high ground 
and commanding nearly the whole length of the lake, will afford 
him abundance of the best accommodation. 

The next important railway-entrance to the district is by the 
new branch line out of the L. & N. W. from Penrith to Keswick. 
This route will, of course, be taken by passengers from the north 
and some from the south who wish to commence their tour at 
Keswick. Many of the latter, however, prefer leaving the railway 
or steamer at Windermere or Bowness, as the case may be, and 
taking the charming drive by coach from thence to Keswick, 



which occupies about an hour longer than going direct from the 
south by railway. Keswick is also reached from the west, via 
Cockermouth and Bassenthwaite ; but this route is by no means 
a frequented one. 



Supposing that the traveller desires to see the lakes and 
mountains thoroughly ; having now shown him the way thither, 
we shall divide our further directions into Districts round the 
towns and villages best suited for the purpose ; yfn-/ giving short 
instructions how to get direct thence to other important places ; 
and then describing fully what is to be seen within a moderate 
Walk ; and thirdly, guiding him over the Drives and Mountain 
Trips which may be easily taken in a day. The ^ MILES ^ 
given by the side of each page are reckoned from the starting- 
point of the Walk or Excursion to which they are subjoined ; 
and the figures refer to the places alluded to in the line opposite. 

The Plans of Towns and Villages, Mountain OutHnes, and 
Maps, especially those showing the ways up the principal moun- 
tains, will materially assist the traveller in his rambles. The 
utility of these will, however, be greatly increased by the posses- 
sion of a pocket compass, without which no novice should at- 
tempt mountaineering. We need hardly suggest a satchel, a 
flask ^ with something in it ' a light waterproof, and a stout stick 
or alpenstock, or, if preferred, a strong umbrella, which will be 
found serviceable in a scorching sun or as a shelter from the 
downpour which occasionally surprises the traveller in this 
region.

Thirty-five years ago, ""SSTinantiermere was so secluded 
that it was some distinction even for a travelled man to have 
seen it. Now there is a Windermere Railway Station, and 
a Windermere Post-office and Hotel, — a thriving "yiTillage of 
"ySSTintiermett, with good inns, and many excellent Lodging- 
houses. The village occupies a commanding yet sheltered 
position, 300 feet above lake-level, on the western slope of 
Orrest Head, — well raised above the damp and mist that 
often overhang the lake; hence the climate is salubrious. 
The natural advantages, coupled with the possession of that 
most important of modern indispensables, — a * first-class' 
railway station, with coaches starting therefrom to all parts 
of the district, have induced many families to settle here. 



12 "55?al{t0 at "ySaTintiermere* 

The neighbourhood is dotted with numerous villas, nearly all 
of which command charming views of lake and mountain. 
The new buildings (and all are new) are of the dark grey- 
stone of the region ; several of them in the medaeval style of 
architecture. The Rev. J. A. Addison, who built the church 
and was the first clergyman here, had a passion for ecclesias- 
tical architecture; and his example has been a good deal 
followed. There is the ©Ti^urcji of St. Mary, and there are 
the schools belonging to it with their steep roofs of curiously- 
shaped slates, both of which the vicarage overlooks. There 
is also the ©'olleije of St. Mary, standing in a fine position 
between the main road and the descent to the lake. This 
college — which may be distinguished by its square tower, — 
was originally intended as a place of education for the sons 
of the clergy ; but, proving unsuccessful in that form, is now 
a flourishing first-class school. 



ORREST HEAD.* 

The hill rising behind the hotel, called Orrest Head, is 
approached by a lane adjoining the house of that name. 
The traveller should by no means miss the walk. All the 
way up, the views are exquisite : but that from the summit, — 
above 650 feet above the lake, — is one of the finest the 
district can show. The whole length of "^iSJinantiermere ex- 
tends below, with its enclosing hills and wooded islands ; and 
towards the head, most of the highest peaks and ridges may 

* It is necessary to say that ^his description of the walk to Orrest 
Head is as it was written in 1852, by the authoress of this guide. The 
path was then, and had for years previously, been used, without hinder- 
ance, by residents and tourists ; but, in' 1873, on the property changing 
hands, gates were locked and stiles walled up, and therefore the visitor 
must be apprised of these obstacles ; but the editor thinks it right, 
under the circumstances, that the original description, with this explana- 
tion, should remain in the volume.

be seen : — Coniston Old Man to the west ; Bowfell and 
Langdale Pikes to the north-west; Fairfield to the north, 
with Loughrigg lying, a& a mere dark ridge, across the head 
of the lake ; while, to the north-east, Troutbeck is disclosed, 
with its peaks of High Street and 111 Bell. All below are 
woods, with houses peeping out ; on a height on the oppo- 
site shore is Wray Castle; further north, Brathay Church, 
set down near the mouth of the valley; and between Lough- 
rigg and the lake, at its head, the white houses of Clappers- 
gate, with the chateau-like mansion of Croft conspicuous 
above the rest. 

The return walk may be varied by getting over the step- 
stile in the comer on your left, and, by the high-side of the 
1% fence, striking into the path in the field below (see plan), 
which presently enters the ^l^llrcag estate at another stile close 
to a wooden gate. From the top of this stile, through the 
trees in front, there is an exquisite view of the head of the 
lake. Keeping on the public path, which cannot be mis- 
taken, and, just after passing a narrow bend, we have 
another glorious picture with Christopher North's cot- 
tage in the rich foreground, while, far away in the distance, 
we shall recognise again some of the mountain tops with 
which we have just become acquainted. The path soon 
joins a wider road ; entering this, and turning sharply to the 
left, we shortly come to the main road, nearly opposite the 
post-office, and to the end of our two miles' walk. 



PATH TO THE LAKE. 

Notwithstanding the popularity of Windermere Village as 
a place of residence, it may seem to the traveller to pos- 
sess one great drawback, and that is its distance from the 
lake ; this, however, is not so formidable (three-quarters of 



14 "^E^^alfes at "yiZSnntJettnete. 

a mile), as may be supposed, for, through the second gate 
just beyond the church, a pleasant shady path of about half- 
a-mile, passing at its lower end a rocky stream with pic- 
turesque falls, conducts us to the margin of the lake at 
Xl^tllerpounti ^ag* Here boats are kept for hire, and 
tourists will find it a convenient starting-point for many a 
pleasant trip. There is here also a suitable place for bathing.^ 
This is the widest part of Winandermere. The quiet 
beauty of the bay, with numerous yachts at anchor, will be 
an attraction to those who may prefer it to more frequented 
landing-places. The trees on the right are the Calgarth 
woods, planted by Bishop Watson. Skirting the lake, there 
is a rough path leading along its margin to Calgarth. 

The return walk to the village should be by ^Sillier ^robJ, 
On reaching the high- way, turn to the left. Passing between 
woods resounding with brawling streams, the road leads up 
a steep ascent, the summit of which is called ^EtammcAanfc 
Hence is seen what, in our opinion, is a view unsurpassed 
for beauty in the whole of the Lake District. The entire 
lake lies below, the white houses of Clappersgate being dis- 
tinctly visible at the north end, with the Finsthwaite Tower 
at the south : and the diversity of the frame-work of this 
sheet of water is here most striking. The Calgarth woods 
rising and falling, spreading and contracting below, with green 
undulating meadows interposed, are a perfect treat to the eye : 

* From the summit of the knoll, called Queen Adelaides Hill, that 
rises above Millerground to the left of the path, and easily distinguished 
by the flag-staff on the summit, the upper portions of the lake appear 
to great advantage. From this point the view is, in some respects, 
unique. Winandermere is seen at its greatest breadth and stretching 
away grandly to the north. Looking across the bay in the foreground, 
the graceful winding shore-line, with its numerous creeks and headlands 
feathered with wood to the water's edge, at once arrests the eye as a 
feature decidedly characteristic of the * Queen of the Lakes.' 



■yiSfalfta at "ySS^inbertnete, 15 

and so are the islands clustered in the centre of the lake. 
Wray Castle stands forth well above the promontory oppo- 
site ; at the head, the Langdale Pikes, and their surrounding 
mountains, seem, in some states of the atmosphere, to ap- 
proach and overshadow the waters, and in others to retire 
and shroud themselves in soft haze and delicate hues pecu- 
liar to cloudland.* There are two houses built just above 
the ridge, which we have thought from the time the founda- 
tions were laid, must form the most enviable abodes in the 
country, — commanding a view worthy of a mountain-top, 
while sheltered by hill and wood and with the main road 
so close that the conveniences of life are as procurable as in 
a street. 

A few yards further and the pedestrian has reached a point 
where four roads meet. book's ^ouse has now dis- 
appeared, and a new residence has taken its place, but 
this junction of roads still retains the name. With it dis- 
appeared a fine specimen of the old fire place of the 
district, with its chimney comers. It is rather a draw- 
back to the romance hanging about these wide old chimneys, 
to know that the good man had to sit with some special 
covering over his shoulders to protect him from the soot that 
the rain brought down. At Cook*s House there were three 
recesses and cupboards in that roofless alcove, — the door 
being of the olti oafe of which such fine specimens may be 
seen in the farmhouses of the dales. We should rather say, 
might till lately have been seen ; for we fear there are but 
few left. The great number of old chests, cupboard doors, 

* * By keeping the turnpike, you soon find yourself on a terrace to 
which there was nothing to compare in the hanging gardens of Babylon. 
There is the widest breadth of water — the richest foreground of wood 
— and the most magnificent background of mountains — not only in 
Westmorland but — believe us — in all the world. That blue roof is 
Calgarth — and no traveller ever pauses on this brow without giving it a 
blessing — for the sake of the illustrious dead ; for there long dwelt in 
the body Richard Watson, the defender of the Faith.' — Professor Wilson,

bedsteads, and high-backed chairs, covered with carvings, 
have found their way to the London curiosity shops, whence 
agents have been sent throughout the wildest parts of the dis- 
trict to buy up such rehcs at high prices ; still there are speci- 
mens left, as the observant traveller will notice. 

Of the four roads which meet here, the one on the left 
leads to Ambleside ] the one directly in front, to Troutbeck • 
that to the right, to Windermere Village. 



ELLERAY AND ST. CATHERINES. 

The public path commences nearly opposite the post- 
office. After a few minutes' walk from the gate, a cart-tract 
will be observed striking off to the right, up the hill, im- 
mediately above Christopher North's old cottage. Winding 
over the shoulder of the hill by this cart-tract, — a rough 
road at the best, and in wet weather, a decidedly moist 
one, — the stile, which opens to the common is unmistak- 
able. The top of the wall forms a most convenient seat for 
resting awhile and enjoying the amphitheatre of mountains 
hemming in the head of Winandermere, seen to perfection 
from this point, through a natural framing of the mountain 
fir. Keeping by the wall on the left for a few hundred yards 
a ' gap ' will usher the pedestrian upon a new and more ex- 
tensive scene. Not only is there a complete bird's-eye 
view of the upper reaches of Winandermere, on the left, but 
in front the eye travels up the beautiful valley of ^tflutbedt 
with its long, straggling, thorough Westmorland village on 
one side, and the steep grassy declivities of High Street and 
111 Bell on the other. 

Turning eastward, a long, bleak tract of moorland* is seen 

* This moor is intersected by several straight and level roads : these 
are in many places overgrown with turf, forming excellent ground for 
equestrian exercise. 



5 "ySfalftg at ■yM'mtiErmere* 17 

'^ Stretching away behind the hill,* dotted here and there with 
clumps of trees, — plane or fir, — in which nestle the isolated 
homesteads so characteristic of our northern scenery. These 
are the picturesque dwellings, not of the ^farmer' as the 
proprietor would be called in southern parlance, but, of the 
* statesman ' of Westmorland, — the owner of lands which 
have been inherited from a long line of ancestors, — the rep- 
resentative, perhaps, of the Thane of other days. 

Keeping to the path (scarcely visible) which tends to the 
right-hand side of the hill, another step-stile will be found 
which drops you on a plot of ground, half-heath, half bog, 
^A called j343pltt{)iBattc Common* This stile, in the broken- 
down boundar)^-wall, indicates the beginning of a track, the 
length of a field or two, "which crosses the common and 
opens upon the high road. Then turning to the left,* com- 
mences a straight and shady road, leading to the trim white 

ij^ hamlet of ©Ttosses. Here, a sharp deflection to the left, 
and a rapid descent, completes the most toilsome, but, at the 
same time, by far the finest part of the walk. At the foot of 

iK this hill we join the Troutbeck road, and on the left is a gate 
which admits to the public foot-path through the Elleray and 
St. Catherine's grounds. 

Once at this gate, the homeward line is a very direct one. 
The copse is shortly entered by a small wicket, and Winlass 
Beck is crossed by a rustic bridge. Emerging, and passing 

* If, instead of turning to the left, the right-hand road is taken, a few 
minutes' walk will bring the lover of antiquities face to face with JVear 
^% Orrest farm, a fine specimen of the dalesman's house. * Warriner's ' — as 
the place is often called — still boasts its court-yard and quaintly-cut box 
and yew trees, its fine grove of planes, well-peopled with rooks, those 
indispensable adjuncts of * auld warld ' scenes. Another picturesque 
example of this form of dwelling, called Tow7tend, is at the western ex- 
tremity of Troutbeck village. The taste of the proprietor, Mr. Browne, 
is displayed by the retention, in the most complete form, not only of the 
external, but also of the internal features of his ancestral abode, which, 
it is said, *if not haunted, ought to be so.' 



i8 "ySaTalks at "yiZSrmtiermere, 

between the grounds of Elleray Bank and the Bingle, the 
Old Cottage under the tree cannot fail to be recognised. A 
more suitable picture than this, wherewith to wind up the 
glorious series presented to the eye during the foregoing 
ramble, could scarcely be desired. Here Wilson came after 
his university career, and spent a merry life ; and here he 
brought his bride in 1811. The last of the Professor's ser- 
vants, ' old James Newby,' the gardener, held his post at this 
cottage until 1869. Billy Balmer, the favourite boatman, 
and others, had gone some years before. Observe the fine 
old sycamore, about which the enthusiastic Professor says : 
* Never in this well-wooded world, not even in the days of the 
Druids, could there have been such another tree ! It would 
be easier to imagine two Shaksperes. Yet I have heard people 
say it is far from being a large tree. A small one it cannot be, 
with a house in its shadow — an unawakened house, that looks 
as if it were dreaming. True, 'tis but a cottage, a Westmor- 
land cottage. But then it has several roofs shelving away 
there in the lustre of the loveliest lichens ; each roof with its 
own assortment of doves and pigeons preening their pinions 
in the morning pleasance. O, sweetest and shadiest of all 
sycamores, we love thee beyond all other trees.' 

ELLERAY. 
(One mile and three-quarters.) 

A great portion of these beautiful grounds has recently 
been thrown open to the public by the kindness of Mr. 
Heywood. Here, on a summer evening, the admirer of 
Wilson can enjoy an hours stroll under the shade of the 
trees whose growth the Professor himself watched with great 
solicitude. Entering by the gate nearly opposite the post- 
office, a narrow gap in the laurel fence on the right will soon 
be found. A small iron wicket gives access to the carriage-

drive which winds up the hill* Along this the tourist may- 
proceed, getting many a pretty peep and some wide views of 
the 'river-lake/ In returning, (when there is a choice of 
roads,) let him take the bend to the right, which leads to the 
pubHc footpath ( p. 13). Once here, he has only to turn to 
the left, reaching, in a few minutes, the point from which he 
set out, the whole round occupying not more than three- 
j^ quarters of an hour. 

LICKBARROW AND HEATHWAITE MEADOWS. 
(3 miles.) 

Standing before Rigg's Hotel, we see on the left, beyond 
the railway, the Pleathwaite and Lickbarrow Meadows hang- 
ing towards the lakef This ' paradise ' as Mr. Payn has it, 

* * Windermere, seen by sunset from the spot where we now stand, 
Elleray, is at this moment the most beautiful scene on this earth. The 
reasons why it must be so are multitudinous. Not only can the eye take 
in, but the imagination in its awakened power can master all the com- 
ponent elements of the spectacle — and, while it adequately discerns and 
sufficiently feels the influence of each, is alive throughout all its essence 
to the divine agency of the whole. The charm lies in its entirety — its 
unity, which is so perfect — so seemeth it to our eyes — that 'tis in itself 
a complete world — of which not a line could be altered without dis- 
turbing the spirit of beauty that lies recumbent there, wherever the 
earth meets the sky. There is nothing here fragmentary ; and had a 
poet been born, and bred here all his days, nor known aught of fair or 
grand beyond this liquid vale, yet had he sung truly and profoundly of 
the shows of nature. No rude and shapeless masses of mountains — 
such as too often in our own dear Scotland encumber the earth with 
dreary desolation — with gloom without grandeur — and magnitude 
without magnificence. But almost in orderly array, and irregular just 
up to the point of the picturesque, where poetry is not needed for the 
fancy's pleasure, stand the Race of Giants — mist-veiled transparently — 
or crowned with clouds slowly settling of their own accord into all the 
forms that Beauty loves, when with her sister-spirit Peace she descends 
at eve from highest heaven to sleep among the shades of earth. ' — Pro- 
fessor Wilson. 

t Through these fields there are several paths, and more than one 
highway, which (excepting one of the latter on the higher ground, lead- 
ing to Winster, ) all end in the main-road to Bowness.

is easily reached by the gate just beyond the first farm on 
the Kendal road. Cross two fields and the railway ; through 
Droomer Stile farmyard, and we have arrived where there 
are hundreds of spots well adapted for building sites. But 
the statesmen of Westmorland, who are not themselves re- 
markably in love with natural scenery, do not readily part 
with land bequeathed to them by their fathers : they have 
received it from a long line of ancestors, and they are deter- 
mined to ' hand it foret.' Such a failing, doubtless, does them 
honour, but it is a pity that the same pious association which 
forbids them to dispose of their property does not induce 
them to improve it. There is no actual want in this favoured 
district ; but nowhere in England are to be found so many 
neglected homesteads as within view of the Langdale Pikes. 
The roofless cottages are so numerous that the self-com- 
placent tourist may imagine that they are suffered to remain 
so for the sake of the picturesque. Unless a new dispen- 
sation has recently commenced here, we shall have many 
relics of this kind to notice on our way ; but far worthier of 
our sketch-book is the view of Windermere Village, with its 
guardian hill of Orrest Head, and the lake in front, stretch- 
ing to the fine group of hills towards its head. After ramb- 
ling on for a mile or two through fields and lanes, we join 
the main road to Bowness. 



TO BOWNESS. 

Having pointed out the short walks and chief points of 
attraction in the immediate vicinity of Windermere, we will 
now conduct the traveller to Bowness, observing that the 
walks which we have described, although nearer and more 
readily approached from the former place, can be taken from 
the latter, which is only distant from Windermere about a 



mile and a-half. On the way we pass the College on the right ; 
then Fairhaven, and, a little further on, the neat grounds 
and villa of Ellerthwaite. A mile further, we come to the 
Baths ; then, on the same side, is the entrance to the Craig, 
and the villa on the right is Craig Foot. Below this, the 
houses begin to thicken. Among them, a road to the left 
leads to one of the most charming points of view in the 
neighbourhood, — a hill named ^tecag H^^^j crested with 
rock, which aifords almost as fine a station as the summit of 
Orrest Head for a view of the lake and its shores. As you 
pass, there is probably a cluster of happy excursionists to be 

i^ seen pic-nicing about the summit, after a truly rustic fashion. 
The main-road, between the two villages, should be 
avoided by pedestrians in dry weather, — the omnibus traffic 
creating a most disagreeable amount of dust. Better far 
spend five minutes more by taking the path towards the lake 
(p. 13) by St. Mary's Church, and complete this delightful 

^^ walk by Rayrigg and Fallbarrow. 



BOWNESS 
Is the port of Windermere : and a bustling little port it is ; 
for there the steamboats put up, and thence go forth the 
large number of fishing and pleasure boats by which the 
lake is adorned. The lower parts of the village, near the 
water, are somewhat hot and steaming in summer : especially 
since the building of a new lodging-house in a space near 
the church, once called the lungs of Bowness. The great 
inns, however, are in airy situations ; the garden platform 
of the Royal Hotel (so called since the visit of Queen 
Adelaide in 1840), overlooks grounds that slope down to 
the shore ; the Crown is on a hill which commands the 
whole place ; and the gardens of the * Old England ' are by 

C3 



22 ;©i3irrnc0!3, 

the margin of the lake. These inns are well managed ; and 
it is for the traveller to say whether their charges, which he 
will find at the end of this book, justify a complaint which 
has been made (we think unreasonably as regards the Lake 
District in general), of high prices. 

The old church-yard with its dark yews, and the ©"i^utri^, 
long and low, are the most venerable objects in the place. 

* Not raised in nice proportions was the pile, 
But large and massy ; for duration built ; 
With pillars crowded, and the roof upheld 
By naked rafters intricately cross'd, 
Like leafless underboughs, 'mid some thick grove, 
All wither'd by the depth of shade above ! ' 

The chancel window of the church contains very fine painted 
glass from Furness Abbey or, as some say, Cartmel. The 
tomb of Bishop Watson will be found in the churchyard, 
near the east window. The rectory, which is hardly less 
venerable than the church, stands at a considerable distance 
from the village, and is approached through fields and a 
garden. The old-fashioned porch is there, of which this is 
said to be the last remaining instance in the whole district, — 
the roomy, substantial porch, with benches on each side, 
long enough to hold a little company of parishioners, and 
a round ivy-clad chimney immediately surmounting the porch. 
Within, there is abundant space, with little elevation ; plenty 
of room in the hall and parlours, with ceilings that one can 
touch with the hand. 

BOWNESS BAY AND THE FERRY NAB. 

(2 miles.) 

The visitor will first repair to the strand, to salute the 
waters. The approach is at the south-west comer of the 



^objness ^ag» 23 

church, through 'the lungs' before mentioned, which are 
inconveniently contracted for the accommodation of summer 
traffic. What a crowd of boatmen, boats, jetties, omni- 
buses, yelling steam yachts, and visitors of all grades, we 
suddenly come upon in that little bay ! Why not, we at once 
suggest, more room, and a promenade suitable for such a 
favoured spot ? A pier is built out into the lake ; and to the 
end of this pier the steamers come many times a day during 
summer. To the right, gardens slope down to the bay, and 
the church just peeps out behind the houses above. Look- 
ing over the lake, ^elle islanti is opposite. In May and 
early in June, the woods of that island, and all the promon- 
tories round, present a most diversified foliage, — from the 
golden tufts of the oak to the sombre hue of the pines, with 
every gradation of green between. In July and August, the 
woods are what some call too green, — massive and impene- 
trable, — casting deep shadows on the sward and waters. 
Within the shadow on the shore stands the angler, watching 
the dimpling of the surface, as the fly touches it, or the fish 
leaps from it : within the shadow on the water, the boat 
swings idly with the current, and the student, come here for 
recreation, reads or sleeps, as he reclines, waiting for the cool 
of the afternoon. Turning to the north, the highest peaks 
are not seen from this strand ; but Fairfield and Loughrigg 
close in the head of the lake. 

Some of our readers will be tempted by the gay and well- 
cushioned boats, and will launch forth on the water at once, 
while others will prefer a stroll along the margin. 

Turning southwards, and walking about a mile, through 
fields by the Rectory, the explorer reaches the point of the 
promontory, ^Kettg 3^ab, which stretches out opposite the 
Ferry house, — itself on the point of an opposite promon- 
tory. There can hardly be a more charming resting-place 



24 j©torrs* 

than a seat under the last trees of this projection. It is 
breezy here ; and the waters smack the shore cheerily. The 
Troutbeck hills come into view, and the head of the lake is 
grander. The round house on Curwen's (or Belle) Island'^ 
is seen among the trees. The Ferry-house, under its canopy 
of tall sycamores, and with its pebbly beach, is immediately 
opposite ; and behind it rises the wooded bank, which is, in 
light or shadow, one of the chief graces of the scene. If 
the sun shines upon it, it is feathered with foliage to the very 
ridge, and the bay beneath it is blue and lustrous. If the 
sun has gone down behind it, the bay is black : every dip- 
ping bird sprinkles it with silver -, and the duck that comes 
sailing out with her brood, draws behind her a pencil of 
white light. 

From this point, a view opens to the south. In the ex- 
panse of waters is another island ; and further down, on the 
eastern shore, a pier extends with a little tower at the end. 
This is Storrs : and at the pier did the guests embark, when 
Scott went to meet Canning at Mr. Bolton's, and the SUS 
regatta took place (under the direction of Christopher North) 
which is celebrated in Lockhart's Life of Scott This was 
only two years before Canning's death, and seven before that 
of Scott. Mr. and Mrs. Bolton are gone, and Christopher 
North himself has followed. 

It is probable that no stranger ever sees that pier without 
thinking of Professor Wilson ; and, indeed, there is no spot 
in tbo neighbourhood, with which his memory, and the 
gratitude of his readers, is not associated. Anywhere such 
a presence is rarely seen ; and it was especially impressive 
in the places he best loved to haunt. More than one per-

a visit. The hotel-keepers of Bowness have authority to give tickets of 
admission. 



son has said, that Wilson reminded them of the first man, 
Adam; so full was his large frame of vitality, force, and 
sentience. His tread seemed to shake the ground, and his 
glance to pierce through stone walls ; and, as for his voice, 
there was no heart that could stand before it. In his hours 
of emotion, he swept away all hearts, withersoever he would. 
Not less striking was it to see him in a mood of repose, as 
he was seen when steering the packet-boat that used to pass 
between Bowness and Ambleside, before the steamers were 
put upon the lake. Sitting motionless, with his hand upon 
the tiller, in the presence of journey-men and market-women, 
his eye apparently looking beyond everything into nothing, 
and his mouth closed above his beard, as if he meant never 
to speak again ; he was quite as impressive and immortal an 
image as he could have been to the students of his moral 
philosophy class, or the comrades of his jovial hours. He 
was known, and with reverence and affection, beside the 
trout stream and the moiintaln tarn, and amidst the deep 
gloom of Elleray, where he could not bring himself to let a 
sprig be lopped that his wife had loved. Every old boat- 
man and young angler, every hoary shepherd and primitive 
dame among the hills of the district, knew him and enjoyed 
his presence. He made others happy by being intensely 
happy himself, when his brighter moods were on him ; and, 
when he was mournful, no one desired to be gay. He has 
gone with his joy and his grief; and the region is so much 
darker in a thousand eyes. 



BISCAY HOW. 
(Half-a-mile.) 

In order to get a bird's-eye view of Bowness and its sur- 
roundings, an early visit should be made to Biscay How, 



2(> ■^JM'allts at ^otoness. 

(p. 2i). It is quite a short walk, with a scramble near the 
top, and may be done in half an hour ; but, on a calm, sunny- 
day, the visitor will linger on these rocks and enjoy the grand 
panorama spread out before him. In the foreground is the 
richly-wooded village, sloping towards the shore : next comes 
the lake with all its charming islands, and the dark Furness 
Fells beyond, while to the north-west we have the highest 
peaks of the district. 

THE RAYRIGG ROAD. 
(Round by Cook's House and Windermere, three miles and a-half.) 

This is not only a pleasant short walk, but one that should 
be particularly noticed, as an important connecting link in 
the following Excursions. The first remarkable object is 
the entrance to the new residence at Fallbarrow, the house 
itself being better seen from the lake ; then we have shady 
trees, with frequent peeps of the lake and hills; next we 
come to ^Biagttgg, — a low, rambling, grey house, standing on 
the grass near a little bay of the lake. It is a charming, old- 
fashioned place ; and its position has every advantage, ex- 
cept that it stands too low. The high wall by the road side, 
immediately before reaching the gate of Rayrigg, is an ex- 
cellent introduction to the stone fences of the region, richly 
adorned as many of them are with mosses and ferns. The 
flagstaff, on an eminence overlooking the lake just before 
reaching Millerground farm, was erected to commemorate 
the visit of Queen Adelaide to the spot. Beyond this we 
come to the path to Millerground Bay (p. 14), and the op- 
posite one through the wood to Windermere Village. The 
stranger will choose his route, and will, probably, go up 
Miller Brow and by Cook's House, round by Windermere 
Village.

STEAMBOAT TRIP. 
(24 miles, inclusive of the visit to 'The Beacon.') 

The next thing to be done is to take a survey of the whole 
lake by a steamboat trip. During the summer, the steamers 
make several trips ; so that the stranger can choose his own 
hour, and go down or up first, as he pleases. In accordance 
with the rule of lake approach, we should recommend his 
going down first. He embarks at the pier at Bowness, and 
is carried across to ^E^fje ^errg, where the boats touch. 
Passing Ramp Holm on the left, and the pretty villa of Fell- 
borough on the right-hand shore, the course is southwards 
for four miles, the lake being enclosed between hills gradu- 
ally lower and lower, until we reach the Midland Railway 
Station, called Lake Side, about which the shores are beauti- 
fully wooded and of ordinary elevation. 

The Swan Inn at ^lii^einbg ]©titrge,* is nearly a mile from 

* The best work that the whole neighbourhood could undertake would 
be the lowering of the weir which carries off the overflow. The inun- 
dations which take place on all the low-lying lands, even up to Rydal, 
from the insufficiency of the outlet, has much increased since drainage 
has been introduced. The excellent and indispensable practice of land 
drainage must be followed up by an improvement in arterial drainage, 
or floods are inevitable. The water, which formerly dribbled away in 
the course of many days, or even weeks, now gushes out from the drains 
all at once ; and, if the main outlets are not enlarged in proportion, the 
waters are thrown back upon the land. This is the case now in the 
neighbourhood of Winandermere, — the meadows and low-lying houses 
at Ambleside, a mile or two from the lake, being flooded every winter 
by the overflow of the lake first, then of the river, and then of the tribu- 
tary streams. There is a weir below Newby Bridge, to serve a Corn 
mill. Now the time of weirs and watermills is coming to an end. In 
these days of steam-engines, it is not to be endured that hundreds of 
acres should be turned into swamps, for the sake of a water-power which 
pays, perhaps, thirty or forty pounds a year. We say this of watermills 
generally ; and, in regard to the need of sufficient arterial drainage, we 
speak of the shores of Winandermere in particular. The expense of 
carrying off the utmost surplus of waters in the wettest season would be 
presently repaid, here as anywhere else, by the improved value of land 
and house property, relieved from the nuisance of floods.

the Railway Terminus at Lake Side. The stranger will 

have to come here again perhaps, when making the circuit 

of the lake by land. If he has time, he should climb to the 

summit of the Beacon, for the sake of the sea-views on the 

one hand, and of the lake on the other ; and then he is oif 

again up the lake.* After the Ferry and Bowness, several 

islands are passed, and, on the eastern bank, we have the 

charming dwellings of Fallbarrow, Rayrigg, Highfield, the 

Priory, and then Calgarth, a yellow-looking mansion, standing 

finely in its broad meadows. Ecclerigg is next, with its 

over-shadowing trees and pretty pier : then we round the 

corner and call at Lowwood Hotel, where there are sure to 

be passengers landing or embarking. This inn offers many 

inducements to the traveller to remain, and is one of the 

most favourite resting-places in the district. Just above 

Lowwood; high tip on the wooded side of Wansfell, will he 

seen Dovenest, some time the abode of Mrs. Hemans, when 

its appearance was more primitive and less pretty, than it is 

now. Next comes Wansfell Holme : this is another choice 

* ' Now we are in the lovely straits between that Island and the main- 
land of Furness Fells. The village has disappeared, but not melted 
away ; for hark ! the Church-tower tolls ten — and see the sun is high 
in heaven. High, but not hot — for the first September frosts chilled 
the rosy fingers of the morn, as she bathed them in her dews, and the air 
is cool as a cucumber. Cool but bland — and as clear and transparent 
as a fine eye lighted up by a good conscience. There were breezes in 
Bowness Bay — but here there are none — or, if there be, they but 
whisper aloft in the tree-tops, and ruffle not the water, which is calm as 
Louisa's breast. The small isles here are but few in number — yet the 
best arithmetician of the party cannot count them — in confusion so rich 
and rare do they blend their shadows with those of the groves on the 
Isle called Beautiful, and on the Furness Fells. A tide imperceptible 
to the eye drifts us on among and above those beautiful reflections — 
that downward world of hanging dreams ! and ever and anon we beckon 
unto Billy gently to dip his oar, that we may see a world destroyed and 
recreated in one moment of time. Yes, Billy ! thou art a poet — and 
canst work more wonders with thine oar, than could he with his pen, who 
painted ' heavenly Una with her milk-white lamb,' wandering by herself 
in Fairyland. ' — Professor Wilson.

situation. On the opposite shore is Wray Castle, — a most 
defensible-looking place for so peaceful a region, but an 
enviable residence, both from its interior beauty and the 
views it commands. Just above it, Pullwyke bay, where lily 
of the valley is found, runs far into the land ; and overlook- 
ing it is Pull Cottage. Next, the sweet tranquil Brathay 
valley opens, with the mansion of Brathay Hall, on a green 
slope above the lake ; and just behind, on a wooded knoll 
in the gorge of the valley, the pretty little church of Brathay, 
built by the late Mr. Redmayne. 

Two rivers fall into the lake, at this north-western comer, 
uniting just before they reach it ; — the Rothay, which comes 
down from Dunmail Raise, beyond Grasmere, and the 
Brathay, which issues from Elterwater, a group of pools, 
rather than a lake, lying at the foot of the hills near Lang- 
dale. The valleys of the Rothay and the Brathay are 
separated by Loughrigg, — the ridge of which, at its further 
end, commands Grasmere; its Winandermere end shelters 
Clappersgate and Waterhead. The steamer sweeps round to 
the pier, where there is a cluster of dwellings, the most im- 
posing of which is the large grey stone house called Wanlas 
How. The Waterhead Hotel is near the landing place. It 
is not large, but has the reputation of being clean and com- 
fortable. Omnibuses are in waiting here, from Ambleside 
and Grasmere, — the one, distant one mile ; the other, be- 
tween four and five. With a view to carrying out our plan, 
however, we suppose our tourist will complete the circuit of 
the lake, by returning to Bowness. 



SAILING MATCHES. 

The traveller will be fortunate if he should chance to be 
here at the time of the regatta, which is usually held in July. 



30 "^a^matttierntere* 

It is one of the prettiest of lake sights. There are generally- 
several sailing matches, the most important being that for 
the challenge cup. The regatta club is composed of the 
gentry of the neighbourhood. 



BOATING AND BATHING. 

There are plenty of boats to be had at Bowness, Water- 
head, and Millerground, and watermen who are practised 
and skilful. The stranger should be warned, however, 
against two dangers which it is rash to encounter. Nothing 
should induce him to sail on Winandermere, or on any other 
lake surrounded by mountains, unless with persons who 
understand the management of sailing-boats. There is no 
calculating on, or accounting for, the gusts that come down 
between the hills ; and no skill and practice obtained by- 
boating on rivers, or the waters of a flat country, are any sure 
protection here. Nothing should induce him to go out in 
one of the little skiffs which are too easily attainable, and 
too tempting, from the ease of rowing them. The surface 
may become rough at any minute, and those skiffs are unsafe 
in all states of the water but the calmest. The long list of 
deaths occasioned in this way, — deaths both of residents 
and strangers, — should have put an end to the use of these 
light skiffs long ago. The larger boats are safe enough, and 
most skilfully managed by their rowers; and the stranger 
can enjoy no better treat than gliding along, for hours of a 
summer day, peeping into the coves and bays, coasting the 
islands, and lying cool in the shadows of the woods. The 
clearness of the water is a common surprise to the visitors 
from a level country ; and it is pleasant sport to watch the 
movements of the fish, darting, basking, or leaping in the 



"yS^aUte; at Botoejss, 31 

sunshine, or quivering their fins in the reflected ray. What 
the quality of the trout and char is, the tourist will probably 
find every day, at breakfast and dinner. 

It may be thought superfluous to add a warning about the 
dangers of bathing. But the residents in the district know 
that there are deaths from this cause almost every summer. It 
is far too common a story that a man has been drowned while 
bathing. When inquiry is made how it has happened, the 
usual answer is that he could not swim, and that he got into 
a hole, and could not get out again. This is not, however, 
the only danger. Strangers see how clear and tempting the 
water looks, and are apt to forget how cold it must be, and 
venture in in a heated or exhausted condition. The result 
is that many deaths have occurred. Nothing can be more 
refreshing than bathing in the lakes or the mountain streams 
and pools ; and it may be perfectly safe, if ordinary pre- 
cautions are taken. The wonder is that they are not, while 
swimming is so easily learnt, and while every one must be 
aware of the danger of going into the water in an unfit 
condition. 



BRANTFELL, WINSTER, WHITBARROW, AND CROOK. 

There is a walk up to Brantfell, which commences by the 
National School, with a steep ascent, passes the Gas-works, 
and then reaches pleasant fields, commanding grand views 
of the lake and its shores. Paths branch ofl in various 
directions. The pleasant valley of "yZtTinster may be 
reached in a mile or two ; and the walk may be lengthened 
in that direction by going as far as ^S^f ftit^artota, (other 
four miles) where several rare ferns will be found in abun- 
dance on the limestone rocks, and a whiff of the sea air may 



32 ^flbinegg to Wxoutitt^. 

be got. Or ©Trofllt, the valley of the wild boar, is about the 
same distance from Brantfell. Here it is said that the last 
wild boar was killed by one Gilpin, and the spot is pointed 
out ; — not at all an unlikely place, one would think, with its 
numerous rocky hillocks, clad with beautiful heath and fern, 
and valleys thickly set with copse and plantations, for har- 
bouring such an animal. In this region there is also a good 
rambling ground in a northerly direction, towards the railway. 



THE TROUTBECK VALLEY. 

By the Church, Bridge, and back by Troutbeck Bridge, 8 miles. By 
the Queen's Head Inn and Lowwood, 12 miles. 

The country people will tell the traveller, as he turns up to 
Troutbeck at Cook's House, that he is going to see * the hand- 
somest views in these parts — especially at the back-end of 
the year ; * and wonderfully fine views they are. Few will 
resist the appeal of the gracious owner of Calgarth, who 
has left a depression in the fence in order that the pictures 
over his lands may be seen : — the well-known features 
about the head of Winandermere can never be seen too 
often : their beauties can never pall, for they change with 
every flitting cloud, with every gleam of sunshine. At each 
bend of the road the view changes ; and, when we come to 
the farm at the summit of a longish climb, we have there 
disclosed * a more extensive, varied, and beautiful scene than 
from any carriage-road within the four seas.' In addition to 
the whole of Winandermere, with its islands and mountains, 
the panorama is completed by the great pointed masses of 
the Kentmere range. 

The road now followed by the tourist descends into the 
valley sharply, by ^]}Z H^oto, and crosses the bridge in

full view of the church, which was consecrated in 1662, 
and thoroughly repaired in 1861.^ It is one of the small 
churches that, with their square tower and bell, look and 
sound so well in the dales. This one seats one hundred and 
sixty worshippers. On the left, high up on the hill-side,t is 
a long, straggling village, built in those days, when every 
man did what was right in his own eyes, the result in this 
case being highly satisfactory in an artistic point of view. 

After crossing the bridge, the road is to be followed up the 
valley ; and the tourist must lose none of its beauties. Be- 
hind him there are views of the receding lake, now diminished 
to the dimensions of a cabinet picture : below is the deep 
vale with its green levels : opposite, the grassy slopes ascend 
the ridges of '^^isb Sixzzi and JH !BriL Immediately 
after passing the Queen's Head Inn, a sharp turn to the left 
must be taken, which brings us to among the houses. 

This singular valley was once a wooded basin, where the 
terrified Britons took refuge from the Romans, while the 
latter were making their great road from Kendal to Penrith. 
The road actually ran along the very ridge of the Troutbeck 
hills, as anyone may see, who will climb the mountain called, 
for this reason, High Street. What a sight it must have been 

* Here it must be decided whether the route is to be 8 or 1 1 miles : 
those for the shorter must take the turn to the left, up the steep hill, and 
then again to the left, which brings them, in a mile and a-half, to familiar 
ground at Troutbeck Bridge. 

t ' Yonder is the village, straggling away up along the hill-side, till the 
farthest house seems a rock fallen with trees from the mountains. The 
cottages stand for the most part in clusters of twos or threes — with here 
and there what in Scotland we should call a clachan — many a sma' toun 
within the ae lang toun ; — but where in all braid Scotland is a mile-lang 
scattered congregation of rural dwellings, all dropt down where the 
Painter and the Poet would have wished to plant them, on knolls and in 
dells, and on banks and braes, and below tree-crested rocks, and all 
bound together in picturesque confusion by old groves of ash, oak, and 
sycamore, and by flower-gardens and fruit-orchards, rich as those of 
Hesperides?' — Professor Wilsojt.

— the pioneers felling the trees, and paving the way, and the 
soldiers following with their armour and weapons gleaming 
in the sun, while the trembling natives cowered in the forest 
below, — listening now to the blows of workmen, and now 
to the warlike music of the troops marching up from Kendal I 
After Romans and Saxons were gone, the valley was a great 
park, and the inhabitants were virtually serfs, in danger of the 
gallows, (which had a hill to itself, named after it to this day,) 
at the will and pleasure of one great man. In the course of 
time, — this is a great many centuries ago, — the valley was 
disparked and divided among the inhabitants, only one very 
large estate being left, — the new park containing 2,000 acres. 
The vale looks, from the uplands, as if it had been scooped 
out into fields, of all manners and shapes ; and the stream, 

— the beck abounding in trout ^ — winds along the bottom, 
from the foot of High Street, to its fall into the lake near 
Calgarth. 

Tradition tells of a giant, ' a man of amazing strength,' 
who lived in Troutbeck Park, in the time of Henry IV. He 
begged from house to house, till he came there, but, finding 
an empty dwelling, he took possession. This house had 
been forfeited to the Crown, and was of so little value that 
he remained for a time undisturbed. At last a tenant 
was found, and came to take possession; but the giant, who 
was * quite uncivilized, and knew no law but strength,' pre- 
vented him. Upon this he was sent for to London, where 
he so pleased the king by his feats of strength that he pro- 
mised anything he might ask for. His petition was the house 
in Troutbeck, the paddock behind it to get peat for fuel, and 
liberty to cut wood in Troutbeck Park. It is said the king 
asked him what he lived upon, and his reply was * Thick 
pottage and milk, that a mouse might walk upon dryshod, for 
breakfast ; and the sunny side of a wedder to his dinner, 



when he could get it.' His mother lived with him, and they 
toiled on these hill-sides, making a livelihood chiefly by cut- 
ting and burning the common brackens, from w^hich they 
obtained a residue which was used in the manufacture of 
soap. Their graves are said to be discernible near the old 
' hog-house.' This was the estate afterwards given by Charles 
I. to Huddlestone Phillipson, for his services in the civil wars. 
The valley now contains a string of hamlets, — Town Head, 
High Green, Crag, High Fold, and Town End ; and its farm- 
steads and outbuildings show some of the most curious speci- 
mens of ancient edifices that are to be seen in the district. 
Among the curiosities of the village is a little inn bearing the 
extraordinary sign of ' The Mortal Man.' It owes its name 
to an old sign-board of which it formerly boasted. The 
board bore the portraits of two well-known inhabitants of 
the valley with this verse between them : — 

* O ! Mortal Man that liv'st on bread, 
How comes thy nose to be so red ? ' 

* Thou silly ass that looks so pale, 

It comes of drinking Birkett's ale ! * 

This board was afterwards removed to Cartmel, and is now 
defaced by the weather. But the author of this rhyme was 
not the only poet who was a native of Troutbeck. The 
uncle of the painter Hogarth lived here, and was famous for 
his songs. They were mostly of a satirical nature, his sub- 
jects being furnished by the pecuHarities of his neighbours. 
The father of the painter also lived here, and the house is 
pointed out, being one of the group at the Crag. The vil- 
lage is almost entirely composed of old houses, most of 
which have undergone little change and few repairs, — the 
ancestral homes of the ' statesmen,' who still exist here in 
unusual force.

Josiab Brown, who lived at Orrest Head, found nearly his 
match in oddity in this vale. A strange fellow in Troutbeck 
had a prodigious bull ; and so had Josiah : and what must 
they do but meet half-way and have a fight ; the terms being 
that the winner should have the fallen animal. Josiah actu- 
ally came riding on his bull. The battle was tremendous ; 
but the Troutbeck animal fell down before Josiah's, and was 
given by him to the poor of Troutbeck. These anecdotes 
appear very strange to people who have lived in towns, or 
among the more level manners of the south; and this is 
why we relate them. They are among the curiosities of the 
district. To find any others so antique and characteristic, it 
is necessary to leave the high-road, and explore the secluded 
dales of which the summer tourist sees and hears nothing. 

We shortly reach Townend, with its sombre yew trees and 
ivied chimneys. At the junction here ^ right wheel ' towards 
Lowwood ; * the other road being to Troutbeck Bridge, and 
not so interesting. In a mile and a half from this the whole 
southern portion of Winandermere is spread out before us ;t 
and, after a bend or two in the road, the upper end of the 
lake, with its majestic surroundings are grandly and gloriously 

* There is, however, fine beck-scenery on the road between here and 
Troutbeck Bridge. ' Ben Slop ' is one of the finest ghylls in the district. 

t * Who said that Windermere was too narrow ? The same critic who 
thinks the full harvest moon too round — and despises the twinkling of 
the evening star. It is all the way down — fi-om head to foot — from the 
Brathay to the Leven — of the proper breadth precisely — to a quarter 
of an inch. Were the reeds in Pull Wyke Bay — on which the birds love 
to balance themselves — at low or high water, to be visible longer or 
shorter than what they have always been in the habit of being on such 
occasions since first we brushed them with an oar, when landing in our 
skiff from the Endeavour, the beauty of the whole of Windermere would 
be impaired — so exquisitely adapted is that pellucid gleam to the lips 
of its sylvan shores. True, there are flaws in the diamond — but only 
when the squalls come ; and as the blackness sweeps by, the diamond of 
the first water is again sky-bright and sky-blue as an angel's eyes. ' — 
Professor Wilsoft 



revealed. The descent to the turnpike is steep, with beauti- 
ful pictures and villas on either hand for nearly the whole 
way : after that, our road home is on familiar ground. But 
it passes a spot where once, in our time, stood the house of 
'butcher Longmire,' — a then conspicuous member of that 
ancient Troutbeck family. Old George had many sons, some 
of whom are now living, and no wonder when ' auld Peggy ' 
lasted until she was one-hundred-and-four, and her grandson 
was the champion wrestler of England, aye of anywhere, for 
years and years. Well, one of these sons, who was young 
and inexperienced, met his nearest neighbour, the bishop, one 
day, and, ladlike, tried to pass his lordship without observing 
due decorum, whereupon he was peremptorily instructed how 
to behave when meeting his betters. Another day, the lad, 
in the course of his duties, was struggling on the road with 
a strong and restive calf, when, to his dismay, he descried 
his lordship. Plunge goes the calf; then plunge again into the 
dreaded presence of the bishop, who was doubtless expect- 
ing the most respectful orderliness from the heated and al- 
most breathless lad. However, he proved equal to the oc- 
casion by proposing an expedient to his lordship : — * If yil 
tak hod et' helter, 77 tak me hat off.' 



THE WESTERN SHORE OF WINANDERMERE. 
(From Bowness and back, 4 miles.) 

We strongly recommend the visitor to cross the lake and 
ramble along the delightful road on the western shore north 
of the Ferry Hotel ; and this should be done early, for an 

In leaving Troutbeck, it may be as well to state, that neither in this 
nor any other valley have we been able to describe all the walks and 
drives which it offers. The summer visitor may find, in each dale, de- 
lightful occupation for days and even weeks, should he have time to linger.

acquaintance with it simplifies other Excursions which we 
have to suggest.^ He will be struck with the healthy growth 
of the ferns by the way-side. There are peeps of the lake 
and islands through the trees, and on some occasions wide 
openings which give grand pictures, but wanting the bold- 
ness of those from the opposite shore. 

In this walk, the Station ^Kouse* above the Ferry Hotel, 
which must have been seen from the opposite shore of the 
lake, peeping out of the evergreen woods, will be visited. 
There the visitor obtains fine views, up and down the lake ; 
and may mark on the way up, the largest laurels he has ever 
seen. Should it be towards evening, some resident will pro- 

* * Let us visit the fort -looking building among the cliffs, called The 
Station, and see how Windermere looks, as we front the east. Why, you 
•would not know it to be the same lake. The isle called Beautiful, which 
hithertofore had scarcely seemed an isle, appearing to belong to one or 
other shore of the mainland, from this point of view is an isle indeed, 
loading the lake with a weight of beauty, and giving it an ineffable 
character of richness which nowhere else does it possess : while the other 
lesser isles, dropt "in nature's careless haste" between it and the 
Furness Fells, connect it still with those lovely shores from which it 
floats a short way apart, without being disunited — one spirit blending 
the whole together within the compass of a fledgling's flight. Beyond 

" Sister isles, that smile 
Together like a happy family 
Of beauty and of love," 

the eye meets the Rayrigg woods, with but a gleam of water between, 
only visible in sunshine, and is gently conducted by them up the hills of 
Applethwaite, diversified with cultivated enclosures, "all green as eme- 
rald," to the very summits, with all their pastoral and arable grounds 
besprinkled with stately single trees, copses, or groves. On the nearer 
side of these hills is seen, stretching far off to other lofty regions — the 
long vale of Troutbeck, with its picturesque cottages, " in numbers with- 
out number numberless," and all its sable pines and sycamores — on the 
further side, the most sylvan of all sylvan mount ans, where lately Hemans 
warbled her native wood -notes wild in her poetic bower, fitly called 
Dove-nest, and beyond, Kirkstone Fells and Rydal Head, magnificent 
giants looking westward to the Langdale Pikes (here unseen),

bably take care that he does not cross the Ferry after dark. 
As reasons in plenty are always found for not marrying on a 
Friday, so it is said to be impossible, somehow or other, to 
get over the Ferry Nab in the ferry-boat, except by daylight. 
Thus if you should arrive at the Nab too late, you may call 
all night for a boat, and it will not come. The traveller may 
judge for himself, how much of the local tale may be true. 
He may, probably have heard of the Crier of Claife, whose 
fame has spread far beyond the district ; but if not, he should 
hear of the Crier now, while within sight of the Ferry Nab. 
If he asks who the Crier was, — that is precisely what no- 
body can tell him, though everybody would be glad to know: 
but we know all how and about it, except just what it really 
was. It gives its name to the place now called ' The Crier 
of the Claife,' — the old quarry in the wood, which no man 
will go near at midnight. It w^as about the time of the 
Reformation, when a party of travellers were making merry 
at the Ferry House, — then a humble tavern, — that a call 
for a boat was heard from the Nab. A quiet, sober boat- 
man obeyed the call, though the night was dark and fearful. 
When he ought to be returning, the tavern guests stepped 
out upon the shore, to see whom he would bring. He re- 
turned alone, ghastly and dumb v/ith horror. Next morning 
he was in a high fever ; and in a few days he died without 
having been prevailed upon to say what he had seen at the 
Nab. For weeks after, there were shouts, yells, and bowl- 
ings at the Nab on every stormy night, and no boatman 
would attend to any call after dark. The Reformation had 
not penetrated the region ; and the monk of Furness, who 
dwelt on one of the islands of the lake, was applied to to 
exorcise the Nab. On Christmas day, he assembled the in- 
habitants of Chapel Island, and performed in their presence, 
services which should for ever confine the ghost to the quarry

in the wood behind the Ferry, now called the Crier of the 
Claife. Some say that the priest conducted the people to 
the quarry, and laid the ghost, — then and there. But lain 
though it be, nobody goes there at night. It is still told how 
the foxhounds in eager chase would come to a full stop at 
that place ; and how, within the existing generation, a school- 
master from Colthouse, who left home to pass the Crier, 
was never seen more. Whatever may be said about the re- 
pute of ghosts in our day, it is certain that this particular 
story is not dead. 

Meantime, the roomy ferry-boat is ready. Two or three, 
or half-a-dozen people take advantage of the passage ; and 
the machine is presently afloat. The Ferry Hotel looks more 
tempting than ever when seen from under its own sycamores, 
— jutting out as it does between quiet bays on either hand. 
The landing takes place on the opposite promontory ; and 
the traveller is presently at his inn. 



ROUND ESTHWAITE WATER, 
(lii^ miles.) 

Esthwaite is, confessedly, of secondary rank as to size and 
the character of its scenery ; but the views round about it 
are so pleasing and attractive, and the associations connected 
with it so interesting, that we confidently recommend the 
tourist to make the circuit of the lake, and to ascend the 
fells on either side, and survey the mountain range beyond.* 

After surmounting the Ferry Hill, on nearing the village 

* Crossing Winandermere at the Ferry is the best approach to Es- 
thwaite Water ; but those whose head-quarters are at Windermere Vil- 
lage, will find the Millerground route and round Lattei-baiTow (p. 43) 
about the same distance. 



of Far Sawrey, the newly-erected church is an agreeable ob- 
ject in the valley below. The old school-house is next seen, 
standing on a rocky eminence, from which a fine view of the 
Coniston mountains is obtained. Scarcely a mile beyond, 
we come to the village of Near ^alBteg, at the end of which 
turn to the left and reach the western shore of Esthwaite 
Water. Care must be taken not to proceed too far with- 
out veering towards the right and crossing a bridge at the 
foot of the lake. The stream which it spans runs towards 
Cunsey, where it flows into Winandermere. A large pool of 
water, lying across the marsh, to the left of the bridge, goes 
by the name of Out Dubs. Soon after crossing the bridge, 
a good view is obtained of the lake and distant hills beyond. 
The road, skirted with wood, runs along the lake-side, until, 
at the third gate, it opens on to the fells.* 

Descending towards the lake, the road passes a farmhouse 
called Esthwaite Hall, the birth-place of Archbishop Sandys, 
founder of the Hawkshead Grammar School. Owing to re- 
cent alterations in the buildings, nothing indicative of an- 
tiquity or importance remains. 

About a mile short of Hawkshead is Esthwaite Lodge, 
formerly the residence of T. A. Beck, Esq., author of the ele- 
gant volume entitled ' Anna/es Furntsienses,^ The quaint 
town of ^Biab)tel)eal]( — a mile beyond — is described in the 
Coniston Section. 

To complete the circuit of the lake, cross the bridge, and 

* From this point an extension of the walk may be made by ascend- 
ing the road which runs up the fells. When the summit of the hill is 
reached, the richly-wooded valley of Dale Park lies beneath, and More- 
cambe Bay is seen glittering on the horizon. Turning to the north and 
east, a fine panoramic view presents itself, extending to the Yorkshire hills. 
As you return, some singular and very fine old yews break the sky-line 
of the fells to the left ; and, in a marshy hollow beyond, lie others of a 
remarkable and contorted growth. Ingleborough is conspicuous from 
these heights. 



42 "jLa^alfe from "^^^mbertnere^ 

leave the little hamlet of Cr0lt5iou3e to the left. The low 
building with its one window, like an eye peeping over the 
wall, is the Friends' meeting-house, and is of early date : 
facing you is their burial-ground, planted and strongly walled 
round, known locally as ^ The Sepulchre.' 

A round pond at the narrow end of the lake, connected 
with it by a narrow creek, exhibits a strange phenomenon. 
It has a floating island, — not like that on Derwentwater, 
which is a mass of mud and vegetable tangle, — but actually 
bearing trees; and this island has been carried by strong 
winds from one side to the other. A local poetess assures 
us it was a favourite resort of the faries : 

* Nor can I, Esthwaite ! say farewell, 
Ere of thy floating Isle I tell, 
Where elvish fays and faries dwell.* 

The name of the pond is Priest's Pot : a fact which some 
explain by a tradition that a priest was drowned there ; and 
another by a superstition of its holding about as much as a 
thirsty priest would like to drink, if the liquor were suffi- 
ciently good. The probability, however, is that it acquired 
the name of Priest's Spot, or Pot, from being appropriated 
as a fish preserve for the Furness monks at Hawkshead Hall, 
the picturesque and ivied archway of which, is passed on the 
road to Coniston. 

About midway along the lake is a yew tree, often mistaken 
for the tree under which Wordsworth rested and studied when 
a schoolboy at Hawkshead : the real relic was cut down 
some years since, in consequence of cattle having been poi- 
soned by eating the cuttings from it. 

Lakebank is a pretty place ; and further on Lakefield, at 
^E^car Satoreg, commands, perhaps, the best view in the val-

ley. Just beyond, the road turns to the left, through an un- 
dulating country of considerable beauty. We find a trace 
of the rebellion of 1745 in the name of a lane called ^ Scotch 
Gate ' (way). It was here that the fearful Highlanders were 
looked for, on their march to Derby ; and here they might 
have had all their own way, if they had come, for Sawrey 
had no idea of showing fight. All the inhabitants, carrying 
their valuables, hied away, and took refuge together in a soli- 
tary building which was called * Cook's hoghouse.' The 
view of Winandermere from the highest point is very fine. 



TO HAWKSHEAD AND CONISTON. 

VIA MILLERGROUND. =* 

(8 Miles.) 

The pedestrian wishing to make a short cut and a most in- 
teresting and diversified walk from Windermere to Hawkshead 
and Coniston, will find the route by Millerground Bay very 
convenient. Having been rowed across the lake, he will see 

iK a road almost close to the margin : this must be followed for 
a short distance in a northerly direction : then the first turn to 
the left must be taken, through Heald Wood, and, after a short 

s% ascent, he will be gratified by, perhaps, the second-best view 
from a carriage-road in all the Lake District. Before him is 
the lake, while ranging in majestic grandeur behind, are to 
be seen the mountain tops from 111 Bell to the Old Man. 
Such a prospect as this he will seldom behold; therefore, 
let him stay a little and enjoy it; and, while he is doing 
so we will point out the principal features of the land- 

* If to be done from Bowness, the road on the western side of the 
lake will be reached by boat at a point south of Belle Grange. An 
extra mile to the distance.

scape. To the right is Wansfell, rising immediately from 
the lake, and just over its side, sloping towards Troutbeck 
and Windermere, he will see 111 Bell and Froswick, belong- 
ing to the High Street range; next Wansfell, northw^ard, 
are the Red Screes and Kirkstone, then Rydal Head, and 
far back is Fairfield, with Ambleside in the vale beneath it. 
The nearer hill is Loughrigg : above it may be seen High 
Raise, that long flat ridge terminating in Langdale Pikes ; to 
the left, not far off, is Oxenfell, and above, W^etherlam and 
the Old Man. Wray Castle is close to us, while immedi- 
ately beneath lies the modest little tarn of Blelham, quite 
unconscious of these distant grandeurs, and reflecting only 
a green field or two. Yonder little church, in the grounds 
of Wray Castle, is a charming object. The road, on reach- 
ing High Wray, turns sharply to the left and winds round the 
end of Latterbarrow.'^ After a mile and a-half of this lane, 
a sharp and uninviting turn on the right must be looked for, 
which leads by High Loanthwaite Farm, direct to Hawks- 
head Hall ; t ^nd from there the road is over Hawkshead 
Hill, and through Mr. Marshall's estate to the Waterhead 
Hotel, Coniston. 



TO HAWKSHEAD AND CONISTON. 

BY THE FERRY. 
(The circuit, returning by Yewdale, 22 miles). 

This Excursion is the same as that to Esthwaite Water, as 
far as Near Sawrey (p 41), — viz : over the lake to the Ferry, 
and through the two villages ; from thence take the eastern 

* If the traveller proceeds on the main-road, he will shortly reach the 
eastern shore of Esthwaite Water (p. 42) and home by the Ferry ; 12 
miles.

side of Esthwaite Water (p. 42) to ^alnfesl&catr* Passing 
through the town, we soon cross a bridge, and reach Hawks- 
head Old Hall, where the turn to the left must be taken, 
up Hawkshead Hill, at the top of which we join the road 
from Ambleside. There is now a rapid descent through 
Mr. Marshall's fine wood, and Waterhead Hotel is reached 
in about a mile and a-half. The village is about another 
half-mile further on.^' 

If the traveller intends returning to Windermere he has 
choice of routes. That commonly taken is by Oxen Fell, 
Skelwith Bridge, Brathay, Waterhead, Winandermere, and 
so back by the eastern side of the lake. This may be varied 
by deviating to the left when a mile and three-quarters from 
Coniston, through the romantic and bold Tilberthwaite 
Valley, and joining the above road near Col with Force, — 
adding about two miles to the excursion. The other way 
home is back through Mr. Marshall's grounds to the top 
of Hawkshead Hill, where the turn to the left must be taken, 
and so via Borwick Ground in the direction of the head of 
Winandermere. The former round is more interesting. 

THE VALLEY OF RUSLAND. 
(17 miles). 

Perhaps no situation is so suitable as this, from which to 
make an excursion through the agreeably-varied country 
lying to the west of the southern end of Winandermere. 
Crossing the lake at the Ferry and turning southwards, we 
soon reach the foot of the steep hill to Sawrey : leaving that 
to the right, we pass through a gate to the road by the lake- 
side leading through a copse-wood district, called Water- 
barrows, and past Fellborough, a charming residence, re- 

* For details of Coniston and its surroundings, refer to that Section.

cently erected. We soon arrive at dTunseg, with its few 
houses and saw mill and hoop manufactory. Further on is 
the bridge over Cunsey Beck which flows from Esthwaite 
Water into Winandermere. The pedestrian will not fail to 
observe how luxuriantly the ferns grow here, especially at 
the side of the stream. 

The roads for some little distance are formed of clay and 
cinders from a furnace which formerly existed on the site 
of a neighbouring bobbin-mill. Vast quantities of iron ore 
were conveyed hither, where the extensive woods afforded a 
ready supply of charcoal. The road just in advance of 
the bridge is still called ' Ore Gates , ' — leading from the 
the furnace to the forge, which was placed a few hundred 
yards up the stream, and where a forge hammer was found, 
weighing 350 pounds. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the 
woods of High Furness were so much reduced by the char- 
coal burning for the blomaries, that many of them w^ere 
suppressed at the common request of the tenants of Hawks- 
head and Colton, who used the tops and croppings of these 
woods to sustain their cattle in hard seasons, the tenants 
charging themselves with the annual payment of ;^2o an- 
nually to the Queen for ever. This was called the blom- 
smith rent. These far-stretching woods are cut down every 
fifteen years, supplying material for the manufacture of hoops, 
(many for the West Indies) bobbins for our cotton manufac- 
tories, charcoal, and a kind of strong and flat basket, used 
in coal mines. Some large landholders contrive to have a 
fall every year of several hundred pounds' value. These 
woods are said to yield a return nearly equal to the same ex- 
tent of well-cultivated land. 

Passing in succession Cunsey Farm, Holme Well, and 
Hammer Hall, we ascend the hill called Bassicks Brow to 
Cat's Crag, whence a noble view of Winandermere is ob- 



tained, — so fine that it is to this day reported that the Roman 
army, struck with admiration, suddenly halted here on their 
march to their station at Ambleside. 

The entrance-gates to Graythwaite Hall soon come in sight. 
This is the property of the Sandys family, decendants of 
the Archbishop. Low Graythwaite, pleasantly-situated a- 
mong woods on the opposite side, and overlooking the lake, 
is the residence of the Rawlinsons. A very short distance 
below the entrance to Graythwaite Hall, and a turn to the 
right, over the end of Greenhaws, brings us within sight of 
the smiling meadows of Rusland : we proceed by a pleasant 
road to Thwaite Head, where it crosses the Dale Park Beck, 
and continues under hanging woods and picturesque farms, 
until the church appears on the right-hand. Rusland Hall 
is seen from the neighbouring bridge which spans the Satter- 
thwaite Beck. ' The two last-named streams, joining at a 
place called the Strands, form Rusland Pool. The tides, at 
high water, rise as far as this point. 

^JSiusIanli, or Rushland, as the vale was formerly called, 
is famous for cross roads and foot-ways ; but the traveller 
must go right on, till he arrives at the pretty neatly-kept par- 
sonage close to the road-side. He is now in the Ulverstone 
road, and a friendly guide-post at the corner will direct his 
steps. The neat white-washed buildings facing him are called 
Rook How, and include, with other tenements, the Friends* 
meeting-house, which is numerously attended on the last 
Friday in every month. During the late reconstruction of 
the church, the Friends kindly lent this chapel for the use of 
their church neighbours. 

The cheerful-looking residence seen in the Ulverstone 
direction is Whitestock Hall, the seat of the Rev. J. Rom-

4^ Excursion from yiSfmtfettnere, 

A turn to the right conducts to Force Forge^ another 
bobbin and hoop manufactory; and, a Httle further on, a 
finger-post points the way by Satterthwaite and Grizedale to 
Hawkshead, which is the most frequented road ; the other is 
straight on past Force Mill, and so by bosky dells and snugly- 
sheltered spots, till we enter, at the bridge, the narrow valley 
of Dale Park. The road here again gives evidence of ex- 
tensive blomaries. 

In the latter part of the 13th century, the abbot of Fur- 
ness obtained license to increase the number of customary 
tenants, and to enclose tracts of land : these enclosures are 
known by the name of Parks, as Abbot's Park, Stott Park, 
Oxen Park, Dale Park, &c. 

In the excursion round Esthwaite Water, we have drawn 
attention to the extensive views which open out as the hill is 
gained after quitting Dale Park, Returning to the Ferry 
again by the foot of Esthwaite, a round of seventeen miles 
will have been accomphshed. It will add between two or 
three miles, if we go round by the head of the lake. 



FURNESS ABBEY. 
(53 miles there and back : 19 by road and 34 by railway.) 

There is choice of routes, — the most favourite one being 
southward on Winandermere to Lake Side Station, and 
thence by the new line of rails to the Abbey. Another 
way is to cross the lake at the Ferry and go by road to 
Coniston, from whence there is a railway to the ruins ; but 
this is more frequently the return route of those who go via 
Newby Bridge. 

Undoubtedly, the steamer is the usual conveyance to Lake 



5E^0 JEinxmm .^hht^. 49 

Side Station, at the foot of the lake, but, as we have des- 
cribed the lake, we will conduct the traveller by the road to 
^etobg ^titJge, which passes the grounds of Storrs, and, 
over hill and dale, winds among the copses till it crosses the 
bridge opposite the inn. The copses of the district have, 
to the remotest date, been valuable for charcoal ; and they 
have become more so since the increase of manufactures has 
stimulated the demand for bobbins. ^j^arcoalAuminjj 
goes on still, we believe, with activity in these southern parts 
of the district. The spot the traveller has just passed was 
the scene of the life of two brothers whose name and fame 
will not be let die. Their name was Dodgson ; and they 
lived in Cartmel Fell above a century ago. They were so 
intent on their wood-cutting that they spent Sunday in cook- 
ing their food for the whole week. They ate little but oat- 
meal porridge, and, when that fell short, they tried Friar 
Tuck's ostensible diet of dried peas and hard beans. As 
they grew old, they began to feel the need of domestic help. 
Said one to the other, *thoomen oot en tak thisell a wife.' — 
'Eigh!' was the reply; 'if thar be a hard job, thoo oless 
sets yan tult.' The thing was accomplished, however ; and 
when the old fellows were still chopping away at upwards of 
eighty, rain or fine, ill or well, there was the wife in the dwell- 
ing, and the children to help. The brothers left considerable 
property ; but it went the way of miser's money ; and there 
are no Dodgsons now in Cartmel Fell. 

There are few objects more picturesque to this day, than 
the huts of the woodcutters, who remain on a certain spot 
till the work is done. Upon piled stems of trees heather is 
heaped to make a shaggy thatch ; and, when the smoke is 
oozing out, thin and blue, from a hole in the centre, or the 
children are about the fire in front, where the great pot is 
boiling, the sketcher cannot but stop and dash down the 

£

scene in his book. The children will say he is ' spying fan- 
cies/ — as they say of every one who sketches, botanizes, or 
in any way explores ; and, perhaps, somebody may have the 
good taste to advise him to come at night, when the glow 
from the fires make the thicket a scene of singular wildness 
and charm. A sad story about the charcoal-burners belongs 
to this neighbourhood. On two farms lived families which 
were about to be connected by marriage. The young lover 
was *a coaler,* — a charcoal-burner; and one stormy day, 
when he was watching his fire, and sitting on a stone near 
to his hut to take his dinner, he was struck dead by lightning. 
The poor crazy survivor, his Kitty Dawson, went to that hut 
after the funeral, and would never leave it again. She did 
nothing but sit on that stone, or call his name through the 
wood. She was well cared for. There was always food in 
the hut ; and some kind eye daily on the watch, — though 
with care not to intrude. One day in winter, some sports- 
men who were passing took the opportunity of leaving some 
provisions in the hut. They became silent in approaching, 
and silenced their dogs. But she could never more be dis- 
turbed. They found her dead. 

It is ten miles from Newby Bridge (Lake Side Station) to 
the cheerful town of "latlberston with which it is now con- 
nected by railway. From Ulverston to Furness Abbey it is 26 
seven more. The former portion of the journey is pretty — 
by the side of the river Leven ; and then we get a sea-view 
at the small port of Greenodd. After Ulverstone, the no- 
ticeable feature is the vast quantities of iron ore about the 
stations and the miner's shafts about the fields by the rail- 
way. 

There is a handsome and excellent hotel at Furness Abbey, 
which has many attractions, besides the first-class accommo- 
dation which it offers, in the various relics of antiquity which

adorn its rooms. Here the tourist should bespeak his bed, 
if he means to study the ruins. 

The J^\jhzig> was founded a. d. i i 2 7. Its domains ex- 
tended over the whole promontory in which it lies, and to 
the north, as far as the Shire Stones on Wrynose. They oc- 
cupied the space between Winandermere on the east and the 
Duddon on the west. The Abbot was a sort of king ; and 
his Abbey was enriched, not only by King Stephen, but by 
the gifts of neighbouring proprietors, who were glad to avail 
themselves, not only of the religious privileges, but of its 
military powers for the defence of their estates against bor- 
der foes, and the outlaws of the mountains, — the descend- 
ants of the conquered Saxons, who inherited their father's 
vengeance. The Abbey was first peopled from Normandy, 
— a sufficient number of Benedictine monks coming over 
from the monastery of Savigny to establish this house in 
honour of St. Marye of Furnesse. In a few years their pro- 
fession changed ; they followed St. Bernard, who wore the 
white cassock, caul, and scapulary, instead of the dress of 
the grey monks. It is strange now to see the railway 
traversing the woods where these grey-robed foreigners used 
to pass hither and thither, on their holy errands to the de- 
pressed and angry native Saxons dwelling round about. 
The situation of the Abbey, as is usual with religious houses, 
is fine. It stands in the depth of the glen, with a stream 
flowing by, — the sides of the glen being clothed with wood. 
A beacon once belonged to it ; a watch tower on an emi- 
nence accessible from the Abbey, whose signal-fire was 
visible all over Low Furness, when assistance was required 
or foes were expected. The building is of the pale red 
stone of the district. It must formerly have almost filled the 
glen : and the ruins give an impression to this day, of the 
establishment having been worthy of the zeal of its founder,

King Stephen, and the extent of its endowments, which were 
priricely. The boundary-wall of the precincts inclosed a 
space of sixty-five acres, over which are scattered remains 
that have, in our time, been interpreted to be those of the 
mill, the granary, the fish-ponds, the ovens and kilns, and 
other offices. As for the architecture, the heavy shaft alter- 
nates with the clustered pillar, and the round Norman with 
the Gothic arch. The masonry is so good that the remains 
are, even now, firm and massive ; and the winding staircases 
within the walls are in good condition in many places. The 
nobleness of the edifice consists in its extent and proportions ; 
for the stone would not bear the execution of any very elabo- 
rate ornament. The crowned heads of Stephen and his 
Queen Maude are to be seen outside the great western win- 
dow of the Abbey, and are now among the most interesting 
of the remains. But it is all sad and silent now. The 
chapter-house, where so many grave councils were held, is 
open to the babbling winds. Where the abbot and his train 
swept past in religious procession, over inscribed pavements 
echoing to the tread, the stranger now wades among tall 
ferns and knotted grasses, stumbling over the stones fallen 
from their place of honour. No swelling anthems are heard 
there now, or penitential psalms; but only the voices of 
birds, winds, and waters. Knowing what a territory the 
Abbots of Furness ruled over, like a kingdom, it is well to 
come hither and look how it is with the old palace and 
mitre, and to take one more warning, how Time shatters 
thrones and dominions and powers, and causes the glories 
of the world to pass away. 

The tourist should be among the ruins late by moon or 
starlight ; and again in the morning, before the dew is off, and 
when the hidden violet perfumes the area where the censer 
once was swung, and where the pillars cast long shadows on 
the sward. 



©*0nist0n. 53 

In order to obtain the best general view of the whole ruin, 
the traveller* must pass through a small gate at the southern 
end, and ascend the grassy slope before him. From the 
ridge of this field he will see not only the Abbey, but a 
great deal of the surrounding country. 

If the return be made via Coniston (a course we can recom- 
mend) an entire change of scenery will be had. On the 
route of the railway are noticeable the Ireleth Quarries, 
which yield vast quantities of dark-coloured j©late, and re- 
mind one of the immense works in Wales; then comes 
Broughton Tower, which, (and no stranger who sees it won- 
ders,) has the reputation of being haunted. We quickly glide 
along, and soon come in sight of Coniston Jkafte, for in- 
formation about which we refer the tourist to our Section on 
that part of the District. See also page 45 for the return 
drive to Windermere and Bowness. 



TO PATTERDALE AND ULLS WATER. 
(28 miles there and back. ) 

This may safely be pronounced one of the finest drives in 
the Lake Country : — all the beautiful valley of Troutbeck 
(p. 32) ; the grand pass of Kirkstone ; and the glorious Pat- 
terdale valley and lake beyond ! — we believe there is not 

* If he has time to extend his ramble, he will find it worth while to visit 
Hawcoat, a small village lying at the south-west of the Abbey, and dis- 
tinguishable from this ridge, by a square tower rising in the midst of it. 
The path lies across fields ; and the distance is about a mile. There is 
nothing of special interest in the primitive little village : and the amaze- 
ment with which the inhabitants regard a stranger shows that they are 
not much in the habit of receiving visitors. The tower is the object 
of attraction. The key is to be obtained at one of the cottages near ; 
and from the top there is a fine distant view of the sands and valley 
of the Duddon, with the mountains that close in the upper end. Or, 
if immense iron works are interesting to the stranger, he may with profit 
go to the town of Barrow, only two miles distant.

half-a-mile of the way which does not exhibit some of the 
charms of the region. After passing the Queen's Head Inn, 
Troutbeck, continue straight forward : in front, protrudes 
Troutbeck Tongue, spHtting the valley into two, and being 
itself most lovely with its farmsteads and cropped thorns 
and coppice and grey rocks; while, behind and above it, 
the vale head rises into grandeur, with its torrents leaping 
down, and its pathway winding up, indicating the pass into 
Mardale. As one bids farewell to the Tongue, he sees the 
summit of Kirkstone before him. He is passing over the 
somewhat boggy upland where the Stock takes its rise, and 
flows down to and through Ambleside, after taking the leap 
called Stockgill Force, (see page 32). 

The road now meets the one from Ambleside at a small 
public-house, (The Traveller's Rest,)* which the ordnance 
surveyors have declared the highest inhabited house in Eng- 
land : and thus it is labelled with a board over the porch. 
In clear weather the sea is seen hence, and the thread of 
smoke from its steamers. The head of Winandermere lies 
like a pond below; the little Blelham Tarn, near Wray 
Castle, glitters behind ; and range beyond range of hills re- 
cede to the horizon. Near at hand, all is very wild. The 
Ambleside road winds up steeply between grey rocks and 
moorland pasture and dashing streams ; and the Kirkstone 
mountain has, probably, mists driving about its head. There 
is something wilder to come, however, — the noted ^Klirfe- 
stone '^amt — the pass of the district. The descent begins 
about a quarter of a mile beyond the house. Down plunges 
the road, with rock and torrent on either hand, and the bold 
sweep of Coldfield and Scandale Screes shutting in the pass ; 
and the little lake of ]®rot]^cr!3* "l^STater lying below, afar 

* It is a very favourite Drive from Windermere to turn here towards 
Ambleside, and thence home on the turnpike.

off among green levels ; and, closing in the whole in front, the 
mass of Place Fell, — the other side of which goes sheer 
down into Ullswater. The stranger must not omit to ob- 
serve near the head of the pass, the fallen rock ridged like a 
roof, whose form (like that of a miniature church) has given 
its name to its precincts. All the way, as he descends to 
Brothers' Water, the openings on the Scandale side (the left) 
charm the eye, — with their fissures, precipices, green slopes 
and levels, and knolls in the midst, crowned with firs. He 
passes through ^Biattsop, and then winds on for two or three 
miles among the rich levels of ^attettale, which is guarded 
by mountains jutting forward like promontories. The Pat- 
terdale inn is another of the good hotels of the district. 
The stranger, who must have left Windermere early in the 
morning, hastens to order a car or a boat, to take him to 
©Ciililiatr0b3 ]}^ar{t, and desires that dinner may await him 
in about three hours' time. 

There is another inn, the Ullswater Hotel, about a mile 
further on, which offers the traveller a choice of going nearer 
the lake, if he wishes. He cannot go wrong in his selection. 
The Patterdale inn is an old favourite, the Ullswater is new ; 
and both are under good management. From whichever 
inn he starts, if the weather is calm and fine, the tourist must 
take a boat to the Park, to see ,.^ra ^orce* After an hour's 
row, Jkgulpj^'s 5Eob)er is reached, an ivy-covered little 
castle, built for a shooting-box by the late Duke of Norfolk ; 
but it stands on the site of a real old tower, named, it is said, 
after Ulf, or L'Ulf, the first Baron of Grey stoke, who gave 
its name to the lake. Some, however, insist that its real name 
is Wolfs Tower. The park which surrounds it, and stretches 
down to the lake, is studded with ancient trees; and the 
sides of its water-courses, and the depth of its ravine, are 
luxuriantly wooded. Vast hills, with climbing tracks, rise 



56 'M.^tnxmn from "l^BrmtJetmere 

behind, on which herds of deer are occasionally seen, like 
brown shadows from the clouds. They are safe there from 
being startled (as they are in the glades of the park) by 
strangers who come to find out Ara Force by following the 
sound of the fall. As he sits in the cool damp nook at the 
bottom of the chasm, where the echo of dashing and gurg- 
ling water never dies, and the ferns, long grasses, and ash 
sprays, wave and quiver everlastingly in the pulsing air ; and 
as, looking up, he sees the slender line of bridge spanning 
the upper fall, he ought to know of the mournful legend 
which belongs to this place, and which Wordsworth has pre- 
served : — In the olden times, a knight who loved a lady, 
and courted her in her father's tower here, at Greystoke, 
went forth to win glory. He won great glory : and at first 
his lady rejoiced in it : but he was so long in returning, and 
she heard so much of his deeds in behalf of distressed 
ladies, that doubts at length stole upon her heart as to whe- 
ther he still loved her. These doubts disturbed her mind in 
sleep, and she began to walk in her dreams, directing her 
steps towards the waterfall where she and her lover used to 
meet. Under a holly tree besides the fall, they had plighted 
their vows ; and this was the limit of her dream-walks. The 
knight at length returned to claim her. Arriving in the 
night, he went to the ravine to rest under the holly until the 
morning should permit him to knock at the gate of the 
tower : but he saw a gliding white figure among the trees : 
and this figure reached the holly before him, and plucked 
twigs from the tree, and threw them into the stream. Was 
it the ghost of his lady-love ? or was it herself? She stood 
in a dangerous position : he put out his hand to uphold her : 
the touch av/akened her. In her terror and confusion she 
fell from his grasp into the torrent, and was carried down 
the ravine. He followed and rescued her ; but she died up- 



^ 5I?o *^^ll0iBater» 57 

on the bank ; not, however, without having understood that 
her lover was true, and had come to claim her. The knight 
devoted the rest of his days to mourn her : he built himself 
a cell upon the spot, and became a hermit for her sake. Our 
tourist must take a guide to this waterfall from the tower. 
He will be led over the open grass to the ravine, and then 
along its wooded sides to the pathway above the brawling 
stream, till it comes to a bridge, which will bring him in 
full view of the fall. The visitor should ascend the steps 
and pathway from the bottom of the fall, and stand on the 
bridge that spans the leap. It is a grand thing to look down. 
He returns to Windermere by the way he came : — first to 
30K the inn : and, after dinner, up ^Eiltttstone ^ass. He will 
hear and see enough to make him wish to come again, and 
stay awhile on Ullswater. Between the church -"and the 
hotel is Grisedale, one of the grandest of the glens about 
Ullswater, in any of which a long summer may be well spent. 
Glenridding, its neighbour valley, is also fine, but deformed 
by the apparatus of lead-mining. Glencoin, a mile or two 
northwards, is the most beautiful of all. Deepdale, in the 
other direction, at the head of the lake, should also be ex- 
plored. Place Fell, above the margin of the lake, looks 
tempting. He would like to visit Angle Tarn, on the 
southern end of Place Fell; and, yet more, Hayes Water, 
the large lonely tarn above Hartsop, where the angler 
delights to seclude himself, because the trout delights in 
it too. It is a high treat to follow up the beck from the 
road, winding among the farms, and then entering the 
solitude of the pass, till the , source of the stream is found 
in this tarn, a mile and a-half from the main-road. The 
little lake is overhung by High Street, so that the Roman 
eagles, as well as the native birds of the rocks, may have cast 
their shadows upon its surface. Its rushy and rocky margin 



58 '^iZt^'alft torn TiS^Tmbertnere to c/5 



►-1 



is as wild a place as the most adventurous angler can ever ^ 
have found himself in. Our traveller must, however, come 
again to see it ; for there is no time to diverge to it to-day. 38 



ASCENT OF ILL BELL AND HIGH STREET. 

High Street and 111 Bell are more easily ascended from 
Windermere than from any other head-quarters. The best 
way of approaching the former is up the Valley of 3? tout- 
becfe, (page 32,) as far as the Queen's Head Inn. At this 
point, a lane diverges to the right, and slopes rapidly down 
into the valley. Fertile meadows are soon reached, and then 
the Park House. Horses or conveyances may be used as far 
as here, which would reduce the walking to the compass of 
most persons who come into the district. Passing in front of 
the farm, you join the well-marked track which runs along the 
side of the Troutbeck Tongue, on the traveller's right-hand ; 
follow this until you come opposite to a deeply-scarred ra- 
vine which descends from 111 BelF, on your right, just beyond 
which a grass road is seen tending up the side of Froswick. 
Cross the stream, pass through or by the sheep-fold, and 
make for this road, v/hich, as it winds up here, is called ^cots 
^Biafo* In a little while you will reach the open side of 
the mountain. The course now is plain to the first cairn, 
(Thornthwaite Crag,) which you see before you. This, 
however, is not the summit; it is a mile and a-half further 
on, at the other side of the wall, overlooking the head of 
Kentmere and Blea Tarn. 

In order to ascend both 111 Bell and High Street, we start 

* It may be worth observing that the name of this mountain is gener- 
ally wi'itten Hill Bell. This is a mistake. The old name is 111 Bell — 
i// meaning, in this connection, evil, difficult, i.e. difficult to ascend. 



-Mi^^ street anU Ml :BelL 59 

as before, — up the Valley of Troutbeck, but leave the road 
of the valley much sooner, — a few hundred yards beyond 
the farm (Low Borran«) from which there is such a glori- 
ous prospect. Here the turn on the right must be taken, then 
the second turn on the left, which leads above Longmire 
farm, and we shortly find ourselves on the open side of the 
hill, whose steepness wearies us but little, for we are enjoying 
the fresh air and the glorious views, or are gathering the fos- 
sils from the Coniston limestone which occurs here. We 
see the whole of the Vale of Troutbeck beneath us, closed 
at the head by Thornthwaite and Threshthwaite Crags, to 
the left of which are the steep Screes above Kirkstone. 
To the left again, the whole of the Scawfell range slowly 
rises above the nearer and lower hills, — Great Gable be- 
ing peculiarly conspicuous on account of its shape, — com- 
pared by the natives to a hay-cock. 

Avoiding the cart-road down the other side of the hill 
to Kentmere, our path is almost straight in front, along an al- 
most imperceptible track which keeps along the ridge. We 
soon leave stone walls behind, and climb the grassy slope of 
the ""^olfe, at the top of which a magnificent view awaits us. 
Guided by a wire fence, we descend a little into the eastern 
slope of the hill, and look down the wonderful precipices of 
^am0b0tr0bj ^rag into ^Klmtmere ^eserboir, and a- 
cross the pass of Nan Bield to the smiling plains at the foot 
of Cross Fell. We shall meet with nothing more wildly 
desolate in the whole tour, than the slopes running down 
from 111 Bell, Froswick, and High Street, into Hall Cove; 
and, in the distance, is a peaceably lovely view, in the direc- 
tion of Kendal, Lancaster, and Morecambe Bay. Returning 
to the ridge, we descend a little, and then ascend 111 Bell, 
or, if we prefer it, keep along a narrow foot-path on the 
grassy slope, running down into Troutbeck. We then repeat 



6o ^M^Qtmt from "JiZSf intiermere* ^ 

the same process on Froswick ; that is, we either go over it 
or round it, and, on the north side of it, join the old Roman 
road, just after having crossed a deep rift called Blue Gill. 
The Roman road, although unused for centuries, is clearly 
visible on the grassy slopes, and will be our guide for some 
distance ; it may, indeed, be traced nearly as far as Penrith, 
and hence the name of the mountain, — High Street. 

A well-built cairn on the summit of Thornthwaite Crag is 
a good land-mark, and its shadow forms a comfortable 
resting-place on a hot day. We have now joined the track 
from Troutbeck Park, and follow the wall in a north-westerly 
direction, and, about a quarter of a mile from the main 
angle, turn to the right, over a great deal of peaty and grassy 
ground. 

The height of High Street is 2,663 ^^^^' The summit is ^^H 
very fine. To the east, lies Blea Water, 600 feet below, and, 
in the valley beyond, the little white house is the inn at 
XlElatbale ©teen* Turning northward, Hayes Water is 
seen, and then Kidsty Pike shuts out the more distant view. 
West of Kidsty Pike, an opening over the hills allows the 
traveller a glimpse of the Scotch mountains. Then comes 
Skiddaw, peeping over the shoulder of Helvellyn. Nearer, 
Ullswater is concealed by Hallin Fell and Place Fell. The 
various summits of the Fairfield range are seen on the 
west, and between them the Langdale Pikes and ScawfelL 
Wetherlam and Coniston Old Man are more to the south, 
and Blackcombe ends the line of mountains. Close at hand 
are Froswick, 111 Bell, and Yoke. Nearly the whole length 
of Winandermere is seen and a long stretch of sea coast. 

Not many years ago, an annual fair used to be held at the 
top of High Street, at which were trials in the usual rustic 
games of wrestling, running, &c. But ^besides this, it had a 
more practical use, for the shepherds of the neighbouring 



Ktcjfj Street 6i 

vales could here recover, or hear tidings of, their missing 
sheep. 

The climber will not unlikely have the satisfaction of catch- 
ing sight of some of the ^Eieti ® eer which are still to be 
found on these hills. This ' chase ' and parts of Devonshire, 
are, we believe, the only places in England — excepting, of 
course, private parks — from which this noble animal has 
not disappeared. 

In case mist or any other cause should prevent the travel- 
ler, when he is at the high end of Troutbeck, from making 
the ascent of High Street, he may be glad to know that he 
can arrive at Ullswater by crossing the pass at the head of 
the valley. The pass is many hundred feet lower than High 
Street, and presents no difficulty of any kind; there is of 
course no path, but the traveller has only to proceed in a 
straight line ; he will find that the ground begins to fall again 
soon after he has reached the top of the pass, and by follow- 
ing the course of the stream, which flows down the hill side, 
he will eventually join the Ambleside and Patterdale road, 
near the foot of Brother's Water. For walking from the top 
of the pass to the Patterdale road an hour should be al- 
lowed : thence to Patterdale is two miles. 

The descent may be made, either to Patterdale, Mardale 
Green, or Kentmere. For the first, let the traveller follow 
the Eoman road for about a mile : he will then be guided by 
a series of juts under ^Efje Jinott, with ^ages "3^ZSf ater 
beneath, on the left; then he will find a zigzag path by 
which he will reach ^fe>;art30p, a little hamlet on the road 
from Kirkstone to Patterdale. To reach Ullswater by this 
way, would make a grand termination to a day's work. 

In the descent for Mardale Green, make for Small Water, 
taking a wide circuit of the cliffs above Blea Water. In this 



62 .Ascent from "!ESf intJ£rmete» 

way reach the path descending from Nan Bield, and you are 
soon on the farm-road of the valley. To those who are in 
a hurry, we should say : Order the inevitable eggs and bacon 
at the small inn ; and, while they are being prepared, walk 
to see the lake, as far as (MlzmmXi ; then, after being re- 
freshed, * tackle' Nan Bield Pass, and go down the Kent- 
mere valley to Staveley Station, from whence a train will 
hurry you to head-quarters. This is also a day's work to be 
remembered, of 37 miles. 

The descent may also be made to Kentmere. We turn 
our backs to the allurements spread before us, and com- 
mence our descent along the grassy slopes of ^ingmell 
E.ttti, avoiding the steep ^kati^bjaite ©'tag, which we 
leave on our right. Hence, passing a sheep-fold on the right, 
at the bottom of ^Kall ©'obe, we soon reach the ^Bieser^ 
faoir, which was formed to supply the Kendal mills and adds 
a very agreeable feature to the landscape, especially when 
seen from its southern end. Here we again join a cart-road, 
and passing at the foot of ^Eiaisborrob) ©Trag, leave be- 
hind us Lamb and Cauldron Quarries, and keep down the 
right or western side of the vale till a white church appears 
above the brow of a low hill in front. From here we have 
the choice of three ways homewards. One is by the carriage- 
road direct down the valley to Staveley ; the second leads 
us above the Hall, past Green Head, and joins our morn- 
ing's road at the top of ©arbuttt; and the third is by the 
Hall Quarries to Applethwaite Common. The first will be 
described in the next excursion ; and the second needs to 
have nothing said about it, except that there is a small pool 
of most beautiful spring water on the right-hand side going 
up. We will take the third road, and, passing close in front 
of the Hall, climb up the large blue flag-quarry. We keep 
along above the walls for about a mile, when we go through a 



gate, over a beck, and then in a south-westerly direction a- 
cross the open heaths. We soon meet with another wall, 
the corner of which we turn, and then descend to Winder- 
5 mere, by High Borrans and Bannerrigg. 

High Street is also conveniently ascended from fatter* 
Ijale* The route is fully described in that Section. 



KENTMERE, MARDALE, AND LONGSLEDDALE. 
Via Staveley. 

(i6 miles by conveyance and 24 walking). 

Few of the Westmorland vales are better worth visiting 
or as little visited as these. The traveller will find in them 
not only some of the wildest and most beautiful scenery in 
the Lake District, but also the most primitive and uncor- 
rupted form of human life. 

There are at least two ways of reaching Kentmere from 
Windermere. One is by the same mountain-road as the as- 
cent to 111 Bell (page 58, paragraph 2), in which excursion 
the deviation is pointed out. We will now describe the car- 
riage-road which goes through the village of Ings and Stave- 
ley. There is little to notice on the turnpike, excepting the 
steep cliff which rises on our left when nearing the latter 
place. 

The river Kent, which gives its name to Kentmere and 
Kendal, runs through j^tabeleg and turns several bobbin- 
mills in the vicinity. The new church is situated on the 
road towards Kentmere, and we soon pass it on our left- 
hand, having the clear river on our right for about half-a- 
mile, when a newly-built bridge leads us across, just below 
some bobbin-mills. The road continues up this side of the 



64 iEimnimn ^[iZEfalfe from '^M"mt(£rmere^ 

vale for about three miles, and, as we ride along, we are 
constantly delighted with new glimpses of wood, rock, and 
waterfall in the foreground, and long stretches of heath and 
pasture on the heights at the head of the valley. 

The tarn or mere was very imperfectly drained a few years 
ago, and its place is now occupied by swampy fields which 
are covered with water in flood-time. There are two farms 
near, and a path-way between them leads up to a wild and 
desolate tarn called j^feeggles T^^ater, lying in the direc- 
tion of Long Sleddale. It is said to afford very good perch- 
fishing, and is two miles from our track. 

At the head of the tarn-basin is the small Low Bridge 
Inn, where we have to leave our carriage, as the road higher 
up the vale is usually considered unfit for any other con- 
veyance than slate-carts. We may, before proceeding further, 
stroll through the church-yard and to Jientmere ^K^ll, the 
birthplace of Bernard Gilpin,^ one of the most able and most 
gentle of the Reformers. The Hall has gone out of the 
Gilpin family, but there are several of the name in the vale 
who boast of their relationship to Bernard. There are few 
finer specimens of the old Westmorland Hall to be seen 
than this one. Its square tower, rising out of a noble grove 
of sycamore, is a beautiful object at all times, but more 

* He was bom in 15 17, and was one of a large family. It is said 
that he showed extraordinary genius in his childhood, and an early dis- 
position to seriousness and a contemplative life ; but, as he grew older, 
he became more energetic and practical, and was none the less pious. 
In beginning his career he suffered from religious persecution, and, if 
Queen Mary had lived a little longer, there is small doubt but that he 
would have been martyred. He remained rector of Houghton-le-Spring 
during the whole of his later life, and from his gentleness and kindness 
he was greatly beloved and obtained the name of the Apostle of the 
North. He built a school, and picked up intelligent boys and educated 
them, becoming their friend and guardian in after life. He had extra- 
ordinary influence over the wild border-people, going fearlessly among 
them. 



especially when autumn has gilded the leaves of the trees, 
and it stands out with its evergreen ivy against the massive 
crags behind with their covering of newly-fallen snow. The 
old yew in the churchyard is worth visiting for the sake of 
the view down the tarn, and the inscription on the marble 
slab in the church cannot fail to interest the visitor. It 
is very curious to stand by the yew on a bright moonlit 
night, and see the hills and trees tower above the thick fog 
in the marshy meadows below, and easy to imagine the long 
vanished lake restored. We are transported back to the 
time when young Gilpin, hearing a monk (whom he had the 
night before seen drunk) discourse against intemperance, 
seriously set his face against the Romish clergy and com- 
menced that fight which, but for the death of Mary, would 
most likely have ended at the stake. We are glad to say 
that the Valley of Kentmere now enjoys a most enviable and 
exceptional reputation for sobriety ; perhaps, a trace of the 
work of this great divine. 

I The ©eologtst will find much to interest him in the boul- 
ders scattered over the low hills behind the church, near Rook 
House, and in the junction of the limestone, slate, and flags, 
by the waterfall at a little distance behind the Inn. This 
waterfall is of no great height, but it deserves a visit from 
all lovers of scenery, on account of its beautiful surrounding 
woods, which afford a delightful shelter to the tired traveller, 
who will, possibly, refresh himself with a dip in the clear 
pool at the foot of the fall while, the everlasting * ham and 

s% eggs ' are being prepared at the Inn. Strengthened with 
these, we resume our journey for Mardale, and may take 
either side of the valley we prefer at starting. If we choose 
the west, we turn to the right, just before reaching the church, 
and pass below the vicarage and above Rook House. The 
road soon descends again into the alluvial valley and runs . 

F 



66 X3Elountam ~^E5^alft from lEiS'mticrmere, 

at the foot of the hills past a farmhouse, and so on to the 
slater's cottage in the soHtudes at the foot of ^SiainsbotrotJ 
^tag. Passing in front of the cottage, we find a road 
which leads us to the weir at the lower end of the reservoir, 
by which we cross to the other side, and, climbing up the 
grassy slopes above it, we reach the path just where a small 
spring issues from the hill-side. This is Toadhowe Well, 
and is famed in the vale as being the best water in West- 
morland. Let the traveller try it for himself. 

To go by the other side of the vale we must cross the 
bridge close to the inn at ^J^mimzxt, and turn sharply to the 
left, ascending till the road takes a sharp turn back to the 
right. We avoid this turn by cutting across a small field and 
follow the road till again it bifurcates. The upper road leads 
to Longsleddale ; by it we shall return. The lower road 
is the one we have to take; and, after passing through 
several gates and the small farm of Overend, it again divides, 

— the lower one keeping in the flat valley, through several 
more gates and past a barn to the reservoir, — the upper one 
rising a very little till it reaches a small stream called Ull- 
stone Beck. All along here we have most glorious views of 
the grand hills at Kentmere head; Rainsborrow Crag, 111 
Bell, and Froswick rising up one after another on the farther 
side of the vale, while High Street and Lingmell End close 
our view on the north, and the crags on our right rise grandly, 
with their cover of graceful birch and coral-berried rowan, 
and hide the bare uninteresting slopes of Kentmere Pike 
and Brown Howe. Crossing Ullstone Beck, — so named 
from a huge boulder which may be plainly seen at its head, 

— we climb the grassy side of ^Eientmere JEongue, always 
keeping well to the left till we are on the top of the ridge. 
The path is very obscure here, but we must keep nearly on 
a level and below the rocks called Smallthwaite Knott which 



^an ^telti ';iPm&. 67 

we leave on our right and soon find the path, and Toadhowe 
Well bubbling up at our feet. 

The serious part of our journey now begins, and there is 
very little of interest to relieve the monotony of the climb 
up the zigzags of ^lHan ]]©l£ltJ, unless a strong northerly 
wind happens to be blowing, when the shrieking and howling 
it makes, as it forces its way through the cleaved rocks at 
the top of the pass, are, indeed, wonderful to hear, but por- 
tend a great struggle to the weary pedestrian who has to make 
his way through this * gate of the winds/ The road begins 
to descend again immediately after reaching the top, and 
winds in and out among huge rocks and boulders till it 
reaches j©mall TiS^ater, — one of the most beautiful of West- 
morland Tarns. But, unfortunately for it, ^lea "^^Sfater, 
— surpassing in grandeur anything in the whole Lake Dis- 
trict, — is close by, — so we move onwards, leaving the path, 
and, climbing under the crags on our left-hand, arrive very 
shortly at the end of t/ie tarn. So steeply. do the huge 
cliffs rise up from the water's edge that it is scarcely possible 
to creep round by the western shore ; and when, as is often 
the case, the clouds rest heavily on High Street, the multi- 
tude of streams which leap down the crags seem as though 
they were the overflow of some great lake above. T/im is 
the time to climb up the ridge on the north side of the water, 
and look down on to the basin below, with the mists pour- 
ing into it from High Street and whirling round and round 
like the steam issuing from some mighty cauldron, now 
opening and showing us the blackness of the waters, with a 
gleam of sunshine reflected from them, and now closing 
again and hiding all in its impenetrable covering. If we 
are rash, we climb up to the very top and look down into 
^BJages "y^ifater on the other side, and watch the clouds 
drifting across the hills from Fairfield and Helvellyn, brought 

F 2 



68 ^Eimnimn "^Sfalft from "ISM'mtiettnete* 

up, one by one, by the wild west wind in its impetuous 
course, and by degrees blotting out landmark after landmark, 
till all we can see is the trace of the Roman road at our feet. 
Glorious too is it to see the clouds suddenly burst, first over- 
head, revealing the deep blue sky above, then opening wide 
over blue Winandermere, shining in the evening sunlight, 
and away by Scawfell and Helvellyn in their new soft-fallen 
mask of snow, to Ullswater and Hayes Water, and to the 
long flat range of Cross Fell. But such pleasures as these 
are to be enjoyed only by those who know High Street well, 
for many are the tales told in the surrounding valleys of tra- 
vellers who have lost their way on the flat top of this moun- 
tain; and even shepherds, who are acquainted with every 
rock and bush on the hill-sides, have had to pass the night 
in the open air. Gladgove Gill, which runs between Gavel 
Crag and Wander Scar, in Kentmere Head, had its name 
changed to Gillespie Gill a few years ago, from the circum- 
stance of three men — two of whom were named Gillespie, — 
having died there from cold on their way from Hayes Water 
to Staveley. 

Leaving Blea Water, we will now follow the beck which 
issues from its lower end and is soon joined by the stream 
from Small Water, which forms a pretty cascade higher up. 
Crossing it, we again follow the path down the valley to 
XSlattale ©rem* 

The Dun Bull is a very comfortable and clean little inn, 
situated in the midst of fresh green fields, and surrounded 
by some of the sycamores for which Westmorland is so fam- 
ous, ^fejalnes 3^3ff atcr, however, the object of our visit, is a 
mile further on, so we recross the beck and soon reach the 
water-side. The view looking down the lake is rather tame ; 
like all the lakes, it should be seen from below, so we stroll 
along its banks as far as Measand Becks, and, looking back, 



have a glorious sight before us. The rough crags of Harter 
Fell (2532 feet) seem as though they rose up close to the 
upper end of the water, while the thickly-wooded cliffs on 
the other side contrast well with the smooth grassy slopes of 
High Street on the right. There are few more perfect pic- 
tures to be found anywhere. The lake is little more than 
three miles long, and about half-a-mile broad. One side is 
richly wooded, the other nearly bare ; and a pair of bold pro- 
montories threaten to cut it into two at this spot, where the 
passage is only two or three hundred yards wide. Near here 
is the little village of X^Eleasanb, a pleasant, quiet place where 
lodgings may be had, and whence the ascent of High Street 
may be made. Round the head of the lake cluster the great 
mountains of Harter Fell, High Street, Kidsty Pike, and 
others, leaving space among the skirts for the exquisite little 
valley of Mardale. Those who are able to obtain one of 
Lord Lonsdale's boats, for the traverse of the lake, may 
think themselves fortunate ; for this is, of course, the most 
perfect way of seeing the surroundings of so small a sheet 
of water : and all other persons are deprived, by prohibition, 
of the means of doing so. There are some good houses 
on the shore and at the further end ; but the occupants who 
live on the very brink are not allowed to keep any sort of 
boat. His Lordship's boats are said to be procurable for the 
asking ; but the preliminaries are a hindrance. The walk 
along the lake-side is, however, easy and agreeable enough. 
The road skirts the north-western bank, and the crags, which 
are sprinkled or heaped about the head of the lake, are very 
fine. They jut out from the mountain-side, or stand alone 
on the green slopes, or collect into miniature mountain-clus- 
ters, which shelter tiny dells, whence the sheep send forth 
their bleatings. 

The road past Measand Becks leads to Hampton and 



70 X^Elountain "SSTalft from I^STmbermere* ^ 

]]§^mrtt|i*, and by it Hawes Water is often visited from 
Pooley Bridge ; but if we are to be back at Windermere by 
the evening, we must not go any further, and abstain from 
visiting the beautiful ferny recesses of the Gill. Our way 
back winds through the levels, round the bases of the knolls, 
past the ruins of the old church, and among snug little farms, 
and the great pikes tower on either hand. The stream which 
gushes here and pauses there, as it passes among rough stone 
or through a green meadow, is the one before-mentioned as 
issuing from Small Water and reinforced by a brook from 
Blea Water. 

The host of the Dun Bull will, if necessary, act as a guide 23 
up the passes. This small green level, which from the moun- 
tain looks such a mere speck, is of some importance at a 
distance. It is said to send a very large quantity of butter 
weekly to Manchester : the carrier's waggons having picked 
it up at the farms and conveyed it to Shap station. 

Retracing our steps towards the pass, we soon find a bridle- 
track branching off to the left and following nearly the course 
of the beck. This is our way to Longsleddale. The only 
very noticeable thing as we climb up is the immense ruin of 
rock under the sides of Harter Fell. Arrived at the top of 
©atesgartji ^ass, we descend again rapidly into J^ong- 25 
slettiale, leaving the deep quarry of Randale Gillf on our 
right and a large fold on our left. Soon after this, we cross 
the stream which descends in a series of beautiful waterfalls to 
the green valley below, while Buzzard Crag towers up nobly 

* Penrith and its surroundings are described in the Ullswater Section. 

t A road turning off to the left here leads across into Mosedale, the 
most desolate and dreary of all the vales. Anyone wishing to reach it 
may follow the road as far as where it crosses the main beck, a mile be- 
low the cottage, and then turn to the right, up little Mosedale to Grey 
Crag Tarn, over into Longsleddale. The road goes down Wetsleddale 
to Shap. 



Jliongslebbale* 71 

on our left, well supported by Raven Crag and Goat Scar on 
our right* Above Buzzard Crag there is a small sheet of 
water called Grey Crag Tarn — it is said to be full of fish, 
and is certainly full of weeds ; the only fisherman seen there 
is a solitary grey heron from Dallam Tower. The climb to 
the tarn is very steep, and a sight of it is hardly worth the 
trouble of going up. 

The first house on the right is Sadgill* ; here we turn off 
through the farmyard and follow a good road up the side of 
the hill, which, after a few turns, leads us safely to the top 
of Stile End Grassing, and then down into Kentmere, where 
we find our conveyance at the Low Bridge Inn, from whence 
the road homewards is as at page 62, or the way we came. 



FROM WINDERMERE TO KESWICK. 
(21 miles.) 

As most of the public conveyances start from the railway, 
we shall suppose this the point of 'departure. If the vehicle 
be the Royal Mail, there will be a halt at the post-office to 
take up the letter-bags ; and then, seated in a real old four- 
horse coach, the journey is enlivened by a sharp ring of eight 
pairs of horses shoes and an occasional solo on the horn, the 
traveller rolls swiftly down the highway. This is at once 
the Cheapside and Rotten Row of the neighbourhood, — 
the principal track of those whom business or pleasure brings 
to the terminus at Windermere. 

* It is a long and not very interesting walk down Longsleddale to Ken- 
dal. Stockdale, half-a-mile below Sadgill, on the other side of the val- 
ley is better worth visiting than any other part of the vale. There is a 
pretty fall in it ; and the rocks will be found, by the geologist, to be 
particularly interesting. We need not return to Sadgill, but can cross 
Sleddale by the bridge leading to Till's Hole, just below a curious 
mound or drift surmounted by larch. 



72 "yiZtfrntiermere to ^E^^^esirrtrit* 

The first object likely to attract attention beyond the village, 
is St Mary's Church, a pretty edifice, which, with the vicar- 
age and schools, form a picturesque group. The first gate 
below the churchyard is the entrance to the Abbey, a resi- 
dence originally intended by its designer for the head-master 
of the College, and, perhaps, the most tasteful of the many 
gothic edfices for which the village is indebted to Mr. Addi- 
son. Half-a-mile further on, the site of Cook's House, — that 
noted landmark for pedestrians from Windermere, Bowness, 
Troutbeck, and Ambleside, — is reached. The road, every- 
where beautiful, is here especially so, overshadowed by the 
fine oaks and beeches of the ©^algatt]^ property. In des- 
cending towards the village of Troutbeck Bridge, — notable 
by the way for its bobbins and bobbin-turners, — there is a 
glimpse of the lake over the trees, by which the wide expanse 
of meadow in the foreground is hemmed in. This is Cal- 
garth meadow, or park, and the low ivy-covered house on 
the verge, near the lake, is Old Calgarth, the ancient man- 
sion-house of the property. It was disused as such after the 
erection of the massive block of building by Bishop Watson, 
now known, /^r excellence, as Calgarth Park: the old building 
contains an upper story, a fine room panelled with oak and 
quaintly ceiled. The kitchen is still ornamented by the arms 
of the PhilHpsons, to whom the estate once belonged, carved 
amid a profusion of intricate arabesque devices, over the 
ample fire-place. 

After crossing 5I?tOUtb£cfe, — a pretty stream, distinguished, 
unfortunately for its name, by the absence of almost every- 
tliing that could tempt the angler to its banks, — the entrances 
to Ibbotsholme on the right and of Calgarth on the left, are 
successively passed. Some three and a-half miles from the 
station, the road widens into the esplanade between Low- 
wood and the lake. Above this most popular of hotels rises 



Wansfell, a hill of no great altitude, but commanding a very- 
extensive view. The little white cottage fronting the south, 
which lies embowered amid the trees on the slope, is Dove- 
nest, where Mrs. Hemans lived for a time. Looking west- 
ward, the towers of Wray Castle stand out conspicuously, as 
though asserting a right to dominate the waters beneath. 
The view of upper "^JSS^Tmantiermere from the pier is very 
fine, especially if the traveller be fortunate enough to see it lit 
up by the glowing tints of a summer sunset. As the coach 

4 approaches the toll-bar, the group of houses about Waterhead 
is immediately in front, and Clappersgate village, on the left, 
is seen nestling under the slopes of Loughrigg. The Brathay 
valley, marked by the Italian campanile of the little grey- 
church at its entrance, opens out gradually. Among the most 
effective objects of the scene, are two bold masses of rock 
which shoot out of the water, surmounted by groups of 
mountain firs. The dark outline of these trees stands out 
in beautiful relief against a background of lighter green. 
The nearer rock marks the point where the combined streams 
of the Rothay and Brathay enter Winandermere. At the 
5E^0ll::bar the turnpike divides, one branch sweeping round 

4^ to the left by Brathay, the other leading directly into ,^LJttMz^ 
Sltie. During the short stoppage in the town, there is time 
to admire the Mechanics' Institute, — a new building of fine 
blue stone, — in the open space near the hotels. 

^i}Z ySinaW will be pointed out in the outskirts, and 
shortly the descent into Rydal Valley is re§,ched, — the nar- 
row gorge, which forms the portal to Wordsworth's Lake, ap- 
pearing to great advantage. The clump of Scotch pines on 
the rocky knoll in the foreground, by concealing the exact 
limits of the ravine beyond them, greatly enhances the per- 
spective ; indeed, few pictures of the same extent are at once 
grander and more perfect in every way than this. 



74 "yiZtf tnbetmere to ^eslwiclt* 

There is a full view or ^gtial ^all from a point a little 
further on, and a nearer peep of it just before entering 
the little village. ^gtial X^ount, the home of Words- 
worth, lies all but hidden by a mass of foliage at the summit 
of a well-shaded avenue which slopes somewhat steeply- 
down to the main-road. Another bend, and a very pretty 
picture of the mere itself is before us, the shore of which the 
road skirts for its entire length, under the bare precipices of 
^ab ^car» In a small white cottage by the road-side, 
Hartley Coleridge lived and died. The coach sweeps round 
a turn in the road, and Grasmere bursts suddenly into sight. 
The scene now presented to view is very different from the 
last. Not only is the sheet of water more regular in outline 
than Rydal, but its surroundings are widely different; in- 
stead of broken rocky declivities, imposing rather from their 
ruggedness than their height, we have a valley shut in on all 
sides by long grassy slopes, for the most part smooth and 
rounded in outline, but towering up into some of the loftiest 
mountains of the district. The isolated hill of peculiar form, 
in front, beneath which the village lies, is Helm Crag, and 
on its summit are the rocks known as the Lion and the 
Lamb. To the left is the entrance to Easedale, one of the 
loveliest of English glens. On the other side the eye travels 
along the Keswick road, stretching over Dunmail Raise, — 
a pass more than 700 feet above sea-level, flanked by Seat 
Sandal on the right and Steel Fell on the left. Both of 
these are lofty mountains, rising some 2,000 feet above the 
pass. The march between Westmorland and Cumberland 
runs along the water shed. Here, also, is the cairn beneath 
which slumber the remains of brave King Dunmail and the 
greater part of his gallant host. The Raise is immortalized, 
not only in the well-known story of the last King of Cum- 
bria, but in the local proverb, ^ Nout good iver kom ower 't 



<i>n t^z ^nxn^vkz. 75 

Raise Gap.' This, be it remembered, is, or was, used with 
infinite consistency on both sides of the Hne; a reUc, no 
doubt, of the old animosities of a race, which must often 
have found a far more than merely verbal utterance on this 
frontier. 

From the little village of "^Etf gtljburn, on the other side 
of the declivity, there is a descent towards beautiful ^SfjW^ 
mere, with its picturesque bridge, waterfall, and noble heights 
on all sides. Leaving the mysteries of the haunted house 
of Armboth to be described elsewhere, we proceed on our 
way towards the entrance of the Valley of St. John, which 
looks tempting for another day. The Castle Rock, of 
^Triermain,' must be especially noticed. After about five 
miles of less interesting scenery, the brow of Castlerigg dis- 
plays, in one grand panorama, the entire stretch of country 
between Bassenthwaite and Borrowdale, including, of course, 
Derwentwater and the town of ^Kleslxricft* 



BY LOWWOOD, THE VALLEY OF THE BRATHAY, RED 
BANK, GRASMERE, AND BACK BY RYDAL AND 
AMBLESIDE. 

(27 miles). 

This is an Excursion very frequently made from Winder- 
mere and Bowness, and is perhaps the most interesting in 
the whole District. The way, as far as Ambleside toll-bar, is 
described in the Excursion to Keswick (p. 71). At the said 
toll-bar, (p. 73,) the road by the lake must be taken, which, in 
K half-a-mile, brings us to ^citf)a2f ^ritige* 

Between Rothay Bridge and Clappersgate, is Croft Lodge, 
— the mansion and its woods being on the right of the road, 



76 "^JiSfmtJermere to ^rasmete* ^

and the gardens stretching down to the river on the left. 

Then comes the pretty hamlet of ©Tlappersgate, so conspicu- 
ous from the lake. Two roads branch off, leading along 
each bank of the river Brathay, to meet at Skelwith Bridge, 
at the other end of the valley. (If the traveller has any 
thought of ascending ^ougl^rigg some other day, he may 
now see, above Clappersgate, the path by which he may as- 
cend or descend : a zigzag path up the hill-side, leading to the 
peaks crowning the south end of Loughrigg, from between 
which the most perfect possible view of Winandermere is 
obtained : that cannot, however, be done to-day.) The left- 
hand road should now be taken, crossing ^tatljag !IBtitJcje, 5% 
and passing the lodge of Brathay Hall ; then, the road on 
the right, by the river-side must be followed.* When the 
stranger sees the churchyard-gate, he must alight, and walk 
up to the church. From the terrace there he commands 
the mountain range from Coniston Old Man to the Lang- 
dale Pikes : the Brathay flows beneath, through its quiet 
meadows ; and its dashing among the rocks, just under his 
feet, catches his ear ; Loughrigg, with its copse and crags, 
and purple heather, rises immediately before him ; and, to 
the right, he sees a part^ of Ambleside nestling between the 
hills and a stretch of the lake. This churchyard has the 
first daffodils and snowdrops on the southern side of its rock ; 
and, in its copse, the earliest wood-anemones. Throughout 
the valley, spring flowers and the yellow and white broom 
abound. 

The road ascends and descends abruptly, and winds to- 
wards and away from the right bank of the Brathay till it 
reaches Skelwith Fold. There the stranger must alight ^,^ 

* The wider road, which branches off to the left, is the one to be fol- 
lowed in going to Hawkshead or Coniston, or in making the circuit of 
Winandermere.

again, and go through a field-gate to the right, to a rocky- 
part called j©p2 KtU? where he commands the finest view of 
the valley and its environs. And again, just before he comes 
to Skelwith Bridge, he must go through the first gate on the 
right in the Coniston road, and follow the field-track until he 
comes in sight of j^feetoitji ^Kotce* He will hardly aver 
that he ever saw a more perfect picture than this, — with 
the fall in the centre, closed in by rock and wood on either 
hand, and by Langdale Pikes behind. Returning to his car, 
he will next pass over the bridge and the roaring torrent 
beneath, and the stacks of wood, — (more coppice-wood for 
another bobbin-mill), and, will find that he has headed the 
valley. As he is not going home, however, but to Gras- 
mere, he turns out of the Brathay Valley by a steep road on 
the left, which ascends again and again, leading by farm- 
steads almost as primitive as those of Troutbeck, and evi- 
dently mounting the spurs of Loughrigg, — which he is 
travelling round to-day, and which must therefore always 
be on the right-hand. After a while, he comes to a sheet of 
water so still, if the day be calm, that he might possibly 
miss it, unless the precision of its reflection should strike his 
eye. It is more likely, however, to be rippled by some 
breeze, and show how deeply blue, or darkly grey, these 
mountain tarns may be. This is ^ougj^rfgg ^axn, well- 
known to all readers of Wordsworth, and consecrated also by 
the genius of Wilson. At some little distance beyond it, the 
stranger must diverge from his road to visit ^Bitljfj ©^lose, 
and see the view which is reputed the finest in Westmorland. 
He may leave his car where the road to High Close ascends 
to' the left, and walk past the house at the top. He will find 
a bench placed so as to indicate the most favourable point, 
and there he is ! overlooking ' the finest view in Westmor- 
land.* To the extreme right, Bowfell closes in the Langdale

Valley, the head of which is enobled by the swelling masses 
of the Pikes. A dark cleft in the nearer one is the place 
where the celebrated Dungeon Gill Force is plunging and 
foaming, beyond the reach of the eye or ear. He can 
gather from this station, something of the character of ^ang^ 
bale* It has levels, here expanding, there contracting ; and 
the stream winds along them from end to end. There is no 
lake : and the mountains send out spurs, alternating or meet- 
ing, so as to make the levels sometimes circular and some- 
times winding. The dwellings are on the rising ground 
which skirt the levels ; and this, together with the paving of 
the road below, shows that the valley is subject to floods. 
The houses, of grey stone, each on its knoll, with a canopy 
of firs and sycamores- above it, and ferns scattered all a- 
round, and ewes and lambs nestling near it, — these primi- 
tive farms are cheerful and pleasant objects to look upon, 
whether from above or passing among them. Nearer at hand 
are some vast quarries of green slate. Below, among planta- 
tions, are seen the roofs of Elterwater Powder Mills ; whence 
the road winds through the village of Langdale Chapel, to 
the margin of the pools which make up the lake. From their 
opposite shore rise the hills, height above height, — range 
beyond range. To the left, almost under the spectator's eye, 
lies Loughrigg Tarn, and, in the distance, Winandermere, 
with Wray Castle prominent on its height, and the Lanca- 
shire hills closing in the view. It is a singular prospect, at 
once noble and lovely. 

The car is waiting where the traveller left it ; but he must 
detain it a little longer. There is a path to the left, just a- 
bove ^Etcti ^ank, which he must ascend. It takes him a 
short distance up the hill to a spot from which he obtains the 
view, now opening before him, in the greatest perfection. He 
had better make up his mind to walk down the steep descent 



of Red Bank, and may, therefore, direct his driver to go for- 
ward while he is making a short detour. The great moun- 
tain that swells grandly above the rest before him is Hel- 
vellyn. The lake that opens below is ©rasmere, with its one 
island of green slope, black fir clump, and grey barn. At 
the farther end lies the village, with its old square church- 
tower, beneath whose shadow Wordsworth is buried. The 
white road that winds like a ribbon up and up the gap be- 
tween Helvellyn and the opposite fells, is the mail-road to 
Keswick, and the gap is Dunmail Raise. The remarkable 
and beautiful hill behind the village is Helm Crag ; and its 
rocky crest fonns the group called * The Lion and the Lamb,' 
and, from several points, the outline is very suggestive of 
that dainty bit under the paw of the lord of the forest. 
This rock has also been named the 'Astrologer,' from a 
strong resemblance it has, when seen from the Raise, to an 
old man reading a book. The white house at the foot of 
Dunmail Raise, is the Swan Inn, where Scott, South ey, and 
Wordsworth set forth on ponies for the ascent of the moun- 
tains ; and behind it rises the path by which pedestrians 
cross from Grasmere to Patterdale, by the margin of Grise- 
dale Tarn, — the mountain-tarn of the wild boar, as the 
words properly signify. To the left of Helm Crag, a deep 
valley evidently opens; that is Easedale; and there our 
tourist is to go to-day. Meantime let him linger awhile, 
that he may learn by heart ever feature of this gay and lovely 
scene. The lane to the right conducts him to the grassy 
bridle-road called Jl^ougj^rigg 3?^trace, where the best views 
are obtained of both Grasmere and Rydal lakes, and which 
winds along the uplands, and then by Rydal Lake, back to 
the valley of the Rothay. We must leave it now, and 
plung5 down Red Bank, which has the characteristics of a 
Norwegian road. At the water-trough at the bottom, the

Stranger enters his car, and passes farms between him and 
the lake, and villas on the rocky and wooded bank on the 
left ; and, at the corner, where the road turns to the village, 
the cluster of lodging-houses, called St. Oswald's, where a 
hydropathic establishment struggled for a time, but found the 
Westmorland winter too long for invalids. 

The driver may stop at the ^Bioti^ag ^Biotel to order din- -'^'A 
ner. Whatever the dinner is to be, it must not be ready 
under two hours, — rather three hours than two. Proceed- 
ing for a mile, between fences and stone walls, the tourist 
reaches the opening to ^asetiale. The gate and shrub- 
bery to the right are the entrance to Lancrigg ; and there 
the regular road ends. The car can cross the stream and 
go about a mile further along the farm-tracks in the val- 
ley, through the meadows, which yield a coarse hay, and 
near the stream which is tufted with alders. At the farm- i2j^ 
house where the car stops, the people will shew the traveller 
the way he must go, — past the plantation, up the hill-side, 
where he will find the track that will guide him up to the 
waterfall, — the foaming cataract which is seen all over the 
valley, and is called Sour Milk Gill Force. The water and 
the track together will shew him the way to the tarn, which 
is the source of the stream. Up and on he goes, over rock 
and through wet moss, with long stretches of dry turf and 
blue heather ; and, at last, when he is heated and breath- 
less, the dark cool recess opens, in which lies Easedale Tarn. 13^ 
Perhaps there is an angler standing on the great boulder on 
the brink. Perhaps there is a shepherd lying among the 
ferns.* There is nothing in natural scenery which conveys 

* From Easedale the pedestrian may pursue his way along the ridge 
to Langdale ; or he may cross into Borrowdale ; but more will be said 
of this in the description of the Walks at Grasmere, at the end of the 
Ambleside Section, 



such an impression of stillness as tarns which lie under pre- 
cipices : and here the rocks sweep down to the brink, almost 
round the entire margin. For hours together the deep 
shadows move only like that of the gnomon of the sun-dial ; 
and, when movement occurs, it is not such as disturbs the 
sense of repose, — the dimple made by the restless fish or 
fly, or the gentle flow of water in or out, or the wild drake 
or his brood paddling so quietly as not to break up the 
mirror, or the reflection of some touch of sunlight or passing 
shadow. If there is commotion from gusts or eddies of 
wind, the effect is even more remarkable. Little white 
clouds are driven against the rocks, — the spray is spilled 
in unexpected places ; now the precipices are wholly veiled, 
and there is nothing but the ruffled water to be seen, — and 
again, in an instant, the rocks are disclosed so fearfully that 
they seem to be crowding together to crush the intruder. 
If this seems to the inexperienced like extravagance, let him 
go alone to Easedale Tarn, or to Angle Tarn, on Bowfell, 
on a gusty day, and see what he will find. 

After his return to the Roth ay Hotel, and his dinner, his 
next object is the Churchyard. In the church is a medallion 
of "y^t? orbgbJOrtfj, accompanied by an inscription adapted from 
a dedication of Mr. Keble's. The simple and modest tomb- 
stone in the churchyard will please him better. For nine 
years it only bore the name of the poet, but the grave was 
opened in 1859 to receive his widow, as the inscription now 
testifies. Besides them lies their daughter ; and next to her, 
her husband, — whose first wife is next him on the other 
side. Some other children of Wordsworth^s who died young, 
are buried near; and one grandchild. Close behind the 
family group, lies ^feiartleg ^oltritlge, at whose funeral the 
white-haired Wordsworth attended, not very long before his 
own death. This spot, under the yews, besides the gushing

Rothay, and encircled by green mountains, is a fitting rest- 
ing-place for the poet of the region. He chose it himself ; 
and everyone rejoices that he did. ^ 

Just after entering the mail-road, the driver will point out 
the cottage in which Wordsworth and his sister lived, many 
long years ago, when Scott was their guest. Several good 
houses have sprung up near it, within a few years. The pro- 
montory which here causes the lake to contract to the little 
river, (which is called the Rothay in all the intervals of the 
of lakes,) may be passed in three ways. The mail-road 
passes round its point, and therefore keeps beside the water ; 
— the Roman road, where the ~^^M'k])inQ ©ate used to be, 
crosses it by rather a steep ascent and descent; — and a 
shorter road still, steeper and boggy, cuts across its narrowest 
part, and comes out at Rydal quarries. Our traveller will 
take the mail-road, probably. It will soon bring him to 
^Elgtial J^aJte; and he cannot but think the valley very lovely 
in the summer afternoon. On the opposite side of the lake 
is ^ougfjtigg with its terrace-walk distinctly visible half-way 
up. The islands are wooded ; and one of them is a herony ; 
and the grey bird, with its long flapping wings, is perhaps 
visible, either in flight, or perched on a tree near its nest, or 
fishing in the shallows, ^ab ^car, the blunt end of Fair- 
field, which overlooks the road and the lake, is very fine, 
with its water-worn channels, its woods and grey rocks. 
Nab Cottage, the humble white house on the road-side, on 
the margin of the lake, is the place where Hartley Coleridge 
lived and died. Those who knew the lakes of old will re- 



* The village of Grasmere has become a favourite place of abode for 
summer visitors. Besides the hotels, there are several lodging-houses, 
where good accommodation may be had. The Walks and Drives are 
many of them the same as are taken from Ambleside, but there are a 
few others which will be described at the end of the Ambleside Section. 



member the peculiar form and countenance which used to 
haunt the roads between Ambleside and Grasmere, — the 
eccentric-looking being whom the drivers were wont to point 
out as the son of the great Coleridge, and himself a poet. 
He is more missed in the neighbourhood than in the literary- 
world : for he loved everybody, and had many friends. His 
mournful weakness was regarded with unusual forbearance ; 
and there was more love and pity than censure in the minds 
of those who practically found how difficult it was to help 
him. Those who knew him most loved him best ; but he 
was sufficiently known afar by his works to be an object of 
interest to strangers who passed his home. He died in 
January, 1849. In the distance, Ivy Cottage peeps out of 
the green ; and, further on, Rydal chapel rises out of the 
foliage on the verge of the park. 

When the turn to the left, which leads up to the chapel, is 
reached, the stranger must alight, and ascend it. He is 
ascending ^Et2tialX3flount; and Wordsworth's House is near 
the top of the hill, — within the. modest gate on the left. 
There, if he can obtain admission into the grounds, he may 
stand on the moss-grown eminence — (like a little Roman 
camp) in front of the house, whence he may view the whole 
valley of the Rothay to the utmost advantage. Winander- 
mere in the distance is — as Wordsworth used to say — a 
light thrown into the picture, in the winter season, and in 
summer, a beautiful feature, changing with every hue in the 
sky. The whole garden is indeed a true poet's pleasaunce ; 
its green hollows, its straight terraces, bordered with beds of 
periwinkle, and tall foxgloves, purple and white, — the white 
being the poet's favourite ; and the summer-house, lined with 
fir-cones ; and then the opening of the door, which discloses 
the other angle of the prospect, Rydal Pass, with the lake 
lying below. Every resident in the neighbourhood thinks 



84 ISSJintJermere to ^angbale* 

the situation of his own house the best ; but most agree that 
that of Wordsworth's comes next. We should say that 
Wordsworth's comes next to those at Elleray and Miller 
Brow, but for the disadvantage of a long and steep ascent to 
it. The ascent might be to some a serious last stage of a 
walk on a hot summer day ; but the privileges of the spot, 
when once reached, are almost incomparable. 

The guide to ^gtial ^allg will by this time have presented 
herself, and the tourist must visit them. They are within 
the park, and cannot be seen without a guide : but some one 
is always to be found at one of the two guides' cottages on 
the ascent of the hill. The upper fall is the finest, in the 
eyes of those who prefer the most natural accessories of a 
cascade ; but the lower is the one generally represented by 
the artist, — the window of the summer-house from which it 
is viewed forming a fine frame, and the fall, the basin of rock, 
and the bridge above, constituting in truth a very perfect 
picture. When there is a dash of sunshine on the verdure, 
behind and under the bridge, to contrast with the shadowy 
basin and pool of the fall, the subject is tempting enough to 
the artist. 

These falls seen, the tourist needs alight from his car no 
more, for he is only a mile and a-half from Ambleside, from 
whence there are four miles of familiar ground to Winder- 
mere. (See page 71). 



TO LANGDALE, BY SKELWITH, COLWITH, AND 
BLEA TARN. 

(There and back, 26 miles. 
The drive to Langdale by Blea Tarn though less interesting 
in its associations than the last, is, on account of the varied 



i 



jgftelbJtft ant (SToIbJift M^H^^ 85 



character and grandeur of the scenery passed through, no less 
enjoyable, and should on no account be omitted by the 
tourist. As far as ^{teli»it|[ ^rtbge, (See pages 71 and 75) 
the route is the same as in the last tour ; here the road to 
Coniston is to be taken, ascending the hill above the bridge 
on the right. When the traveller has surmounted the hill, the 
first turn to the right will bring him to Colwith Bridge, 
which he will have seen immediately below. 

For those who like to combine a little walking with the 
drive, it is a good plan to quit the carriage at Skelwith Bridge, 
ordering it to await your arrival at Colwith Bridge. Turning 
in at the first gate on the right on the Coniston road, a path 
will be seen tending to the left, up the hill ; the one on the 
right leads to j^feetoitfj ^Rorce, which fall can be visited on 
the way without retracing your steps, as there is a track above 
the fall bringing you out into a meadow, which must be 
crossed towards the gate in the left-side of it, and then follow 
a path through the copse and past two farms. At the latter 
farm, cross the cart-track leading up into the road, and take 
the gate into the field, where there is a glorious view of the 
mountains. The path crosses the field and descends by 
zig-zags to Colwith Bridge, where you will find the carriage 
awaiting your arrival. If the traveller wishes to have the 
best view of the fall, he should go over the stone step-stile 
on the left-hand just before crossing the bridge, and follow 
the path through the copse and then by a grassy walk to the 
right, which conducts to a rock facing the fall, where there 
is a far better view than from the opposite bank. Little has 
been said about ^cliBtt]^ ^orce, and it is overlooked by the 
majority of tourists, but, when seen from this point, its leap 
of seventy feet, with either bank covered with foliage, and 
grey rocks appearing here and there, it forms one of the 
most perfect pictures we know. It has this advantage also 

G3

over the other falls of the district, — there is nearly always 
a considerable body of water in it. 

After crossing the bridge, the road turns to the right, the 
one immediately in front would take the traveller to Elter- 
water, and thence up to Langdale by a shorter route than 
the one by which we are conducting him. Just before reach- 
ing ^jfeangbale 3?arn, we join the road from 5I3iIiJttt]^toaite, ^°^ 
The road from this point is through the valley in which ^lea 
^arn lies, — the scene of those books of Wordsworth's 
* Excursion ' which relate to the Solitary. After ascending 
some little way, we drop into the vale where the single farm- 
house is, and the tarn, and the stone, * like a ship with keel 
upturned,' which is lodged in a stream near the tarn. Some 
people have unaccountably fixed on the Bowder Stone to 
answer this description ; but, besides that the Bowder Stone 
is far away, it rests on its edge, instead of its * keel ' being ^^K 
'upturned.' 'The two huge peaks, that from some other 
vale peer into this,' are the JE^angtiale ^ito; and very fine 
is the view of them from this wild and somewhat dreary 
hollow. Since the ' Excursion ' was written, large planta- 
tions of larch have arisen ; but they do not much ameliorate 
the desolation of the place. A very rough road* descends 
by Wall End to ©teat ^atigbale, where, after passing a 
farm, we soon reach the 'Dungeon Gill Hotel.' The Dungeon ^3 
Gill JVew Hotel is nearly a mile further on, and, as it is 
nearer to the force, it affords the more convenient resting- 
place for visitors who merely wish to see it. 

Whichever hotel the traveller choose, there is one thing to 
be done without doubt, — to visit dungeon ©ill Strangers ^^^z

is preparing. There are guides at the inn to accompany the 
party ; the path is, however, well marked. After leaving the 
new Inn and ascending for a short distance, a turn to the 
right leads towards the stream. — In starting from Dungeon 
Gill Hotel, the green path on the hill-side will be pointed 
out ; and the traveller must take care not to make for the 
waterfall he sees in front. The path he wants tends to the 
left, till it reaches a fence and gate, when it turns sharply to 
the right ; after which there is no possibility of losing the 
way. It presently joins the stream from the force, which 
leads up a dark fissure, — * dungeon ' and ' gill,' both mean- 
ing a fissure. There is a well-secured ladder, by which 
ladies easily ascend to the mouth of the chasm ; and, when 
they have caught sight of the fall, they can please themselves 
about scrambling further. There is the fall in its cleft, 
tumbling and splashing, while the light ash, and the vegeta- 
tion besides, is everlastingly in motion from the stir of the 
air. Above, a bridge is made, high aloft, by the lodgment 
of two blocks of rock in the chasm. The finest season for 
visiting this force is in a summer afternoon. Then the sun 
streams in obliquely, — a narrow, radient, translucent screen ; 
itself lighting up the gorge, but half concealing the projec- 
tions and waving ferns behind it. The way in which it con- 
verts the sprays into sparks and many-coloured gems can be 
believed only by those who have seen it. 

There are two ways home from this point, — down Lang- 
dale to its junction with the Brathay Valley, or by High 
Close, to Grasmere. We have little to observe about them, 
— Langdale having been described at page 78, as seen 
from High Close, and the Grasmere route at page 79. 
Langdale chapel is a primitive hamlet, where the old charac- 
ter of the district is preserved. The little chapel was rebuilt 
in 1857-8, chiefly, we understand, by the munificence of two 



88 "E^ifintiermEre to ©Tontston 

private individuals. Some few years since, the pulpit of the 
old chapel fell, with the clergyman, Mr. Frazer, in it, just 
after he had begun his text ^ Behold I come quickly.' The 
pulpit fell upon an elderly dame who escaped, wonderfully. 
Mr. Frazer, as soon as he found his feet, congratulated her 
on surviving such an adventure : but she tartly refused his 
sympathy, saying, * If I'd been kilt, I'd been reet sarrat 
[rightly served], for yeh threeaten'd ye'd be cumin doon 
see-en.' Near this chapel is the Thrang slate-quarry, where 
the stranger should look in, and see what a mighty excavation 
has been caused by the demand for this fine slate. Just be- 
yond the chapel, the roads part, — that which ascends to 
High Close climbing the hill to the left. We will take the 
other towards Skelwith and Brathay, and so home by the 
head of Winandermere. 

TO CONISTON, 

BY HIGH CROSS, AND BACK BY TILBERTHWAITE. 

(28 miles.) 
The drive to Coniston has been already described, as 
far as the point at which it diverges from the ^ratfjag 
'y^'alleg, (pages 71 and 75). It then skirts the grounds of 
Brathay Plall, and passes near the lake at Pullwyke Bay. 
A little further on, the road turns to the right, and ascends 
a steep hill to a small public-house called Barn Gates ; here 
the traveller must not forget to notice the grand view from 
the steps outside the Inn. From this point the road is 
through a wild woodland country, until ^Kisft ^tOSS is 
reached, where the road from Hawkshead comes up and 
joins that on which we travel. After a while, we descend 
steeply towards ©Tonfeton, and get our first introduction to 
the water. The road is wire-fenced now, and signs of cul- 
tivation are all about; it winds among noble woods and 



ant» ^ilbertljbjaite. 89 

spreading meadows, whose depth of grass make a perfect 
paradise for sheep and kine. As we come down towards 
the shore, the long narrow lake stretches before us like a 
river, the part nearest us turned into frosted silver by the 
sunlight and ripple. Waterhead Hotel stands by the lake 
side as you enter Coniston. 

A question will now arise whether time can be afforded 
for an excursion on the lake, either by the steam gondola or 
by row-boat. If our tourists have started early this cer- 
tainly can be done while luncheon or dinner is prepared.' 
The lake is described in our Coniston Section ; as regards 
the luncheon we doubt not it will deserve equal praise in 
its way. It should be stated that the return journey by 
the new road over Oxenfell is considerably shorter than that 
by Tilberthwaite, but not so interesting. 

Both roads leave Coniston in the same direction, but the 
Tilberthwaite Valley diverges by a steep pitch on the left, 
just before reaching High "^^eintjale farm, and enters upon 
the wild fell-road that carries you up the right bank of the 
stream towards ^E^ilbertj^toaite, past the rubbish heap of a 
copper-mining * level ' and vast debritic accumulations from 
long abandoned slate quarries. If time did not press, it 
were worth your while to leave your carriage and clamber 
up the fell side here to examine the curious rocky chambers 
' left by the old slate workers, and, a little farther up, a 
magnificent ravine and waterfall, almost utterly unknown 
to the tourist. But here your road brings you to the 
top of the Horse Crag, with a wall of living rock on your 
left, and a sheer descent of more feet than you would like 
to fall, with the beck brawling far below on your right, and, 
directly in front, the lovely little basin-like valley of Tilber- 
thwaite — 

* Urn-like it is in shape — deep as an urn ! ' 



90 "yiK'mtiermete to CToniston 

much more so indeed than Blea Tarn, to which, as you 
know, this line was first applied. Tilberthwaite is * paled 
in by many a mountain high/ and that so effectually 
that when you are fairly in it, you begin to feel anxious about 
a practicable way out. After passing through the fell-gate, 
you find upon your left a group of old farm buildings, now 
chiefly converted into cottages for miners and their families. 
Old Lanty Slee, the famous whiskey-spinner, formerly had 
his abode here, and, for years, carried on his hazardous 
occupation in a cave formed by himself at the end of the 
old stable, which, as you see, stands with its shoulder thrust 
into the hill side. The entrance to the little cavern was 
cunningly made through the sunken gable of the building, 
beneath the manger from which his old horse fed ; and, had 
Lanty been gifted with ordinary prudence, he might still have 
been supplying his thirsty neighbours with the product of 
his nocturnal operations, — genuine fire-water. These old 
houses are the scene of two striking illustrations of the 
salubrity of the district and the longevity of its inhabitants. 
In this first cottage, some years ago, was a far from infirm 
old woman nursing her grandson's grand-child. The nurse 
and the child representing the extremes of five generations ; 
so that had the intermediate members of the line been all 
female, old Mary Tyson might have recited the well-known 
jingle, ^ Arise daughter, and go to thy daughter, for thy 
daughter's daughter hath got a daughter ! ' The other in- 
stance was, perhaps, more remarkable still. About the same 
period, one of the adjacent cottages was occupied by a 
young couple named Dawson, whose children could boast of 
fourteen living ancestors, namely, their parents, — all their 
grand-parents, and all their great-grand-parents. 

The name of Tilberthwaite, we may mention, indicates 
that it was originally a * clearing,' devoted to the cultivation 



antj ^E^iftertj^ljjaite. 91 

of barley. The second syllable, lengthened out, being an 
obsolete name for that grain, still occasionally used in Scot- 
land. The road soon leads you into the farm-yard of High 
Tilberthwaite, where you have a choice of two roads for 
continuing your journey ; and, though that to the left, leading 
over the heights, may be the shorter, the other is recom- 
mended as being the pleasanter. It meanders cheerfully 
through an irregularly wooded vale nearly a mile in length, 
connecting Tilberthwaite with Little Langdale. The enor- 
mous heaps of blue stone, and the deep excavations on 
every side of you, indicate the position of glate quattks* 
The stream which you soon approach is a branch of the 
Brathay, which, rising on Wrynose, and the other hills round 
the head of Little Langdale, flows down that valley, forming 
one of the finest * forces ' in the country at Colwith, and, 
after joining the Great Langdale stream in Elterwater, 
another of less height though of greater bulk at Skelwith, 
and ultimately becomes a principal feeder of Windermere. 
You now stand upon the verge of Lancashire, for this brook 
forms here the boundary between that county and West- 
morland. Before crossing the beck you may be tempted to 
follow its course upwards on the Lancashire side, and soon 
fall in with a primitive stone bridge, of one bold graceful 
arch, spanning the beck with as much elegance as though it 
were a segment of the rainbow instead of a mere row of 
slate flags jammed together perpendicularly in a rude but 
eflicient fashion. This bridge is one of the very few re- 
maining of the class whose rapid disappearance if so feel- 
ingly deplored in one of Wordsworth's essays on lake scenery ; 
wherein also are eulogized * the daring and graceful contempt 
of danger and accommodation with which so many of them 
are constructed, the rudeness of form of some, and their 
endless variety/ The Dalesmen, it may be observed, have 



92 "lES^Finliermete to 

no regard for the picturesque, and never hesitate to sacrifice 
it when it can be replaced by the useful. 

You then cross the beck, and, entering Westmorland, 
come upon the old road along which goods were formerly- 
carried by pack-horses between Kendal and Whitehaven. 
Now the turn is to the right ; that to the left being in the 
direction of Blea Tarn and Wrynose and Hardknot, which 
was described in the last excursion. Our road leads by Col- 
with Force, which has been described at page 85, and then, 
after a climb, we descend to Skelwith Bridge ; then by the 
Brathay Valley, and head of Winandermere. (pages 76 and 
71 in reverse). 



OTHER EXCURSIONS FROM WINDERMERE. 

Practically, there are very few of the important places of 
the Lake District which cannot be visited in one day from 
Windermere ; but some of them are more conveniently done 
from other of our centres ; and, therefore, we abstain from 
giving details here, but give a few hints which will put hardy 
travellers, such as the universities and public schools afford, 
in the right way. 

@r0ni0t0n @lti X3Elan may be ascended, by crossing 
Winandermere, as at page 43. The whole work should be 
done in nine hours, leaving abundance, in a long summer 
day, for food and rest. It is, of course, equally easy to those 
who drive to Coniston. 

"IKf astirrater. — It is also practicable to visit not-so- 
remote but difficult-to-get-at Wastwater, and return in one 
day. It can even be walked by some men we know. In 



IIDigftant ^lac00, 93 

that case, the route would be up Little Langdale, over Wry,- 
nose and Hardknot, and through by Burnmoor Tarn ; about 
25 miles each way. If attempted by equestrians; down 
Winandermere, by steam yacht, by rail round by Ulverston, 
to Ravenglass, Drigg, or Seascale, and then by horsed- 
conveyance, would probably be the best route ; but possibly 
the Railway Time Tables might show that to drive to Coni- 
ston Station would be best, and thence by rail to Seascale. 
It ought to be remarked, that it is possible to drive over 
Wrynose and Hardknot, and it is easy enough on horse- 
back. 

^cabDfeiL — By driving up Langdale to the Dungeoi) 
Gill Hotel, this mountain can easily be ascended in one day 
by good walkers. Six hours should be reckoned for the 
driving and four or five for the walking. A guide can be had 
at the hotel. 

JButtertnxre anti Crrumtn0c{t JlxaltEg. — Walkers, with 
experience of the hills, would go up Great Langdale ; pro- 
cure a guide at the Dungeon Gill Hotel ; then up Rosset 
Gill ; by Sprinkling Tarn ; and strike for Black Sail. This 
is only eight miles, as the crow flies, from Langdale Head ; 
but is at once an arduous piece of mountain work and cer- 
tainly one of the finest walks in the district. These Lakes 
can also be * done ' in a day by taking the early coach from 
Windermere to Keswick, where it arrives about nine o'clock. 
At ten or so, several of the hotel-keepers despatch waggon- 
ettes over Honister Pass to Buttermere, and home by the 
Vale of Newlands. If the driver will not undertake to be 
back at Keswick at 4 30, in time for the coach, we must 
advise a private car, by which the round can be done in good 
time. 

jSkibtiato and j^atitllebacfe. — Either, or both, of these 
can be ascended, although much more remote than others we 



have noticed. Early coach to Keswick, as in the last ex- 
cursion. After that, good walkers can ascend both moun- 
tains and be back in Keswick in time for the return coach 
at 4 45- 

^Biel&ellgn. — This, of course, is more easily done than 
Skiddaw. The mail coach which leaves Windermere at 
6 a.m., arrives at Wythburn Inn between 7 and 8 ; therefore 
there is a long day before the pedestrian, which will enable 
him to take ^aitfieltK on his way back, and catch the coach 
at Grasmere or Ambleside on its return journey. 

The Details for these Excursions will be readily found by 
using the Index at the end of this book.

..^tnblesitie is a pretty picturesque town, (of some 1500 
inhabitants,) seated at the head of Winandermere, in a soft 
green valley with the grim mountain tops looking down upon 
it from their stations in the sky. The remains of a ^Bifltttan 
©'amp near the lake testify to its antiquity, while its name 
— said to be a corruption of Amahilis situs — still bears the 
impress of our former conquerors. The town has lost 
much of its former quaintness within the last few years, for 
the old houses are fast giving place to modern structures, 
w^hich, though doubtless more useful, are less picturesque. 
The new ^^urc]^, so conspicuous from all parts, is more of 

H 2 



loo .^mhlm^t. 

a blemish than an ornament, unhappily from its size and 
clumsiness, and the bad taste of its architecture. Though 
placed in a valley, it has a spire, — the appropriate form of 
churches in a level country; and the spire is a different 
colour from the rest of the building ; the east window is also 
remarkably ugly. There have been various reductions of 
the beauty of the valley within twenty years or so ; but this 
is the worst, because the most conspicuous. The old church 
is suitable to the position, and venerable by its ancient aspect. 
The site of the churchyard, and the health of the people 
who lived near it, was such as to make the opening of a new 
burial-ground a pressing matter ; and hence, no doubt, arose 
the new church, though a larger and more beautiful cemetery 
might easily have been found in the neighbourhood. 

In the space dignified with the name of market-place, a 
handsome mechanics' institute has been erected by the 
munificence of a gentleman in the neighbourhood. The 
shops in the town are in or about the market-place, and the 
Salutation, Queen's, and White Lion, the three principal 
Hotels, are all conspicuous in it. The traveller can hardly 
be wrong in his choice of one of these, as they all three 
comfortable and well-served. At present there are no baths 
in the place ; — a singular deficiency where there is so much 
company on the one hand, and of water on the other. The 
inconvenience is, however, a subject of serious complaint : 
and it is to be hoped that this needful refreshment for the 
dusty and tired traveller will be provided, — to say nothing 
of the residents, who much desire it for purposes of health 
as well as enjoyment. 

Ambleside and Grasmere still keep up the old custom of 
Rushbearing. It is a memorial of the time when churches 
were regularly strewn with rushes. At each of these places, 
— in Ambleside, on the Saturday preceeding the last Sunday 



i 



~533al{ts at Jimblesfte* loi 



in July, and at Grasmere, on the previous Saturday, — the 
children of the place go in procession to the church, each 
carrying a garland, or other device, made of rushes. They 
leave them there for the Sunday, and the next day the child- 
ren go and remove them. 



TO STOCKGILL FORCE. 
(One mile.) 

The stranger is guided through the stable-yard of the 
Salutation Hotel, when he passes under a tall grove of old 
trees on the right-hand, the stream being on the left. On 
the opposite bank is the bobbin-mill, one of the few industrial 
establishments of Ambleside, placed there on account of the 
abundant supply of coppice-wood obtainable in the neigh- 
bourhood. The stacks of wood are seen, high on the bank ; 
and the dwelling of the proprietor ; and then the great water- 
wheel, with its attendant spouts and weir, and the sounds of 
gushing and falling water. The ugly, tall chimney behind is 
a memorial of the drought of 1859. The proprietor of the 
mill suffered so severely from want of water to carry on his 
trade, that he determined no other summer should find him 
unprepared with a more reliable power. Where the path 
forks towards and away from the stream, the visitor must 
take the left-hand one: The other is the way up '^^Sl'am^ 
felL His path leads him under trees, and up through a 
charming wood, with the water dashing and brawling further 
and further below, till the ear catches the sound of the fall : 
and presendy after the track turns to the left and brings 
him to a rocky station whence he has a full view of the force. 
It is the fashion to speak lighdy of this fall, — it being with- 
in half-a-mile of the inn, and so easily reached ; but it is, in 
our opinion, a very remarkable fall, (from the symmetry of 

H3 



I02 "^SSfallts at ^^mblesibe* 

its parts,) and one of the most graceful that can be seen. 
Its leap of about seventy feet, is split by a rocky protrusion, 
and intercepted by a ledge running across ; so that there are 
four falls, — two smaller ones above, answering precisely to 
each other, the two larger leaps below no less exactly resem- 
bling. The rock which parts them is feathered with foliage, 
and so are the sides of the ravine. Below, the waters unite 
in a basin, whence they flow down to the mill, and on in a 
most picturesque torrent, through a part of Ambleside, and 
into the meadows, where they make their last spring down a 
rock near Millar Bridge, and join the Rothay about a mile 
from the lake. 



THE BRATHAY VALLEY. 
(7 miles.) 
The way to the Brathay Valley is to take the road lead- 
ing to JSldtljag ^ritJ^e (see plan), then through ©Tlappers^ 
gate, across ^Etatljagi ® ritJge, and the first turn to the right ; 
this will introduce him into the valley, the leading features 
of which are delineated in one of the drives at page 76. 
The round, by Spy Hill and Skelwith Bridge, forms a 
charming walk of seven miles. It is the place for the earliest 
flowers of the spring, and distinguished by the broom grow- 
ing thickly on the bank of the river, and yellow globe- 
ranunculus flourishing on the rocks at the brink, or in the 
midst of the stream. In the autumn, the side of Loughrigg, 
which overhangs that valley, is splendid with flowering heather. 
The opposite character of this and the sister valley is strik- 
ing, and led to the remark of a resident of Ambleside that 
if one wants a meditative walk in mid-winter, one goes round 
the Brathay valley, — sure to meet nobody but the postman ; 
whereas, if one needs recreation after a morning of study. 



"ys^alfes at ,^mblE3ttJe. 103 

the walk should be round the Rothay valley, where one is 
sure to meet all one's aquaintances. The finest view in this 
valley, and, indeed, one of the finest in the whole district, is 
from j^feetoit]^ !Kflltr, mentioned at page 76. 



THE ROTHAY VALLEY. 
(3 miles.) 

There is no missing the way round the ^Eioti^ag yi allege 
The circuit, from bridge to bridge at each end, is about three 
miles ; but there is a path through the middle which divides 
it into two short walks, — the northern occupying about three- 
quarters, and the southern about half-an-hour. This path 
begins with a lane nicknamed Stony Lane, which opens just 
opposite the foot of the old church hill, and leads to the 
meadows, through which there is a path which ends at Millar 
Bridge, the small high arch which spans the Rothay in the 
midst of the valley. Here the walker can take his choice of 
the northern or southern end of the valley. Going south- 
wards, he comes to Rothay Bridge, described on the road to 
Clappersgate, and can take any one of the three roads which 
meet at the bridge, — the one to Clappersgate to the right, 
the one to Waterhead or that which turns to Ambleside. 

If the northern half of the valley is preferred, the first 
object of interest is Fox How, the residence of the late Dr. 
Arnold. The road passes behind the gardens and opens 
upon a fine view of Fairfield commanded by the house. It 
then sweeps past Foxghyll, and other pleasant abodes, and 
follows the windings of the little river till, at '^ditt ^StibjDfe, 
it joins the main-road from Ambleside to Rydal, at a mile 
and a quarter from Ambleside. The rest of the way is des- 
cribed in the return from Grasmere at page 114. 



I04 TS^allts at M^mhh&itit. 

Thus much for the level of the valley. If the stranger 
desires to look down from the heights, there are some delight- 
ful walks within feasible distance. 



LOUGHRIGG FELL. 

In the first place there is Jlhon^xiQQ, which occupies the 
longest line, though of inferior elevation. The paths up it 
show themselves ; but there is one so much the best to 
descend by, that it is well to point it out. From whatever 
quarter the stranger mounts, throughout the whole range of 
the hill, he should come down by the zigzag behind Clappers- 
gate. At Millar Bridge, just mentioned, there is a good road 
up, past the back of Loughri gg Brow, and by a farm called 
Brow Head, visible from all parts of the valley. There are 
other tempting paths at the Foxghyll corner : and there are 
few parts where an active walker cannot mount with ease, 
excepting for the impediment of high walls, which render it 
necessary to keep to the frequented tracks, avoiding the 
fences. The whole ridge, from above Grasmere, at one end, 
to above Winandermere at the other, offers the most charm- 
ing views of the surrounding heights and vales, lakes and 
tarns. The final survey should be taken from the southern 
extremity, where, from two peaks, or from a seat between 
them, the most perfect possible view of Winandermere and 
its environs is obtained. By looking about a little, just below 
the more southern of the two peaks, the beginning of a zig- 
zag path will be found ; and there the traveller must come 
down upon ©TlapperSjpfate, enjoying, as he descends, the 
distant view of the Langdale group of mountains, and the 
picture of the valley of the Brathay at his feet. Another 
delightful walk over Loughrigg is found by crossing it from 



"ys^alte at M^rvMm^z. 105 

west to east There is a way up between walls, from a point 
not far above Red Bank. The highest point of the ridge is 
marked by a pile of stones, and is near the northern end. 
From this point, and it is the only one, the two lakes, Gras- 
mere and Winandermere, may both be seen. The pedes- 
trian may descend either upon Loughrigg Terrace, or near 
Rydal, or by the farmhouse at Brow Head. The only 
obstacles are the boggy parts, which render this walk difficult 
after rain ; and the stone walls. A careful survey from one 
of the highest points will show the stranger a series of gates 
in more than one direction, and by following the line he may 
descend without difficulty to almost any point he may have 
chosen. 



TO SCANDALE AND SWEDEN BRIDGE. 

(Three miles and a-half there and back. ) 

If he desires to ascend the opposite heights, nothing is 
easier, and there are few walks more charming than the one 
to ^inetJm ^rtlige, which spans the Scandale Beck at no 
great distance from its source. Three of these becks or 
brooks come down into the ^Eiotfjag " yi alleg from the 
eastern heights ; — the Stock, which is described in the ac- 
count of Stockgill, and which flows along Stony Lane, falling 
into the Rothay at Millar Bridge ; the Scandale Beck, which 
descends from the cul-de-sac between the Kirkstone road and 
the Rydal heights, passing under the main-road between 
Ambleside and Rydal : and the Rydal Beck, rising from the 
cul-de-sac of Fairfield, and taking its way down through the 
park to join the Rothay near Pelter Bridge. It is the second 
of these streams which is spanned by the little old-fashioned 
picturesque arch of Sweden Bridge, placed in the midst of 
the wilds. 



io6 "yztfalfes at M^vMz^itiz. 

Going up the Kirkstone road, there is a turn to the left, 
just before the old Ambleside church (see plan). This is the 
road to be pursued. It leads past the new hamlet of Eller- 
rigg, and on through fences for a considerable way, — the 
occasional gates affording glimpses of a further view. JJtgtial 
)]^ark and the lake are. fairly commanded, and the valley 
of the Rothay lies below, under the slopes of Loughrigg. 
By the time the road issues from the fences, the scene is en- 
tirely changed, for the stranger's face is turned towards the 
recesses of the hills. The path here is exceedingly rough. 
The Scandale slopes sweep upward to the right, partly bare, 
and partly scrubby with bushes which afford some shelter to 
sheep ; and down below, on the left-hand, the stream gushes 
along, making music in its rocky bed. Its channel, partly 
overhung with trees, is in some places so crowded with rocks 
as to split the brook into a multitude of little waterfalls, while 
elsewhere it leaves room for pools tempting to the bather. 
The first green path which tends towards the stream, leads 
to the bridge ; — it is a wild walk up the cul-de-sac^ where 
nobody ever seems to go, except the shepherds after their 
flocks. A fold in ruins is seen just above the bridge ; and 
beyond it all is wild rock and stream and scanty herbage, as 
far as the ridges. The regular mode of return is by the way 
one came : but some who do not mind a scramble, and an 
occasional bog, with some difficulty in finding the path, re- 
turn by the other side of the stream. It is a delightful walk, 
and particularly when the open down is reached which com- 
mands another view of the valley and its southern opening, 
as well as the Rydal Pass. The path crosses a little bridge 
at the farmhouse called The Nook, (where the stream is as 
beautiful as anywhere), and passes between fences all the rest 
of the way, coming out upon the church hill at Ambleside. 



'^^M'alk^ at ^^mblesfte* 107 



WANSFELL. 
(4 miles of hill work.) 

The ascent by the other two becks need no detailed des- 
cription. Stockgill has already been noticed. To ascend 
the heights, the stranger has only to follow the lane by which 
he arrived at the wood containing the waterfall, and he will 
find himself high up on the side of "JiM'ansfell when the 
fences come to an end. The rest of the ascent is merely a 
steep grassy slope, by which he will attain the rocky crest of 
the mountain. There is no difficulty, and no great fatigue in 
the walk, providing it be taken in dry weather. After rains, 
there is a good deal of boggy ground. 



As for the ^EistJal ^©ecfe, it is well known by its falls, 
(page 84). Above the park, the stream is still beautiful, pre- 
senting a succession of little falls, and leading up into the 
heart of the recess of Fairfield. 



The streams, levels, and heights of Ambleside Valley being 
thus disposed of, it only remains to notice two or three walks 
within reach at either extremity, besides those which merely 
follow the high-road ; — as up towards Kirkstone, over to- 
wards Coniston, down towards Winandermere, and onwards 
towards Grasmere. 



GRASMERE TERRACE. 
(8 miles.) 

One lovely walk is along the face of Nab Scar, from 
^gtJal to ©tasmere. At the summit of Rydal Mount, 



io8 "53S"alb0 at ,^mblesitie» 

a path leads to the left, immediately behind Wordsworth's 
house. It proceeds, in the form of a terrace, all the way to 
Grasmere. The further gate of Wordsworth's garden opens 
upon this green terrace ; and it is truly a poet's walk. It 
commands first the whole length of the Rothay Valley, with 
Winandermere in the distance ; then the turn of the pass, 
with the bold slope of Loughrigg opposite ; then the pass 
itself with Rydal Lake sleeping below ; and, finally Gras- 
mere, where it brings the stranger into the main-road. 



LOUGHRIGG TERRACE. 
(9 miles.) 

Finer still is the opposite terrace-road. Some visitors have 
considered the ^0U(j]^ri(J54Errace walk the finest in the 
district. It is a long stretch from Ambleside, — the circuit 
being not less than nine miles : but of these four or five can 
be taken in a carriage, or the whole on horseback. There 
is a bridle-path all the way. The point of departure from 
the turnpike is belter ^rtb^e, a mile and a quarter from 
Ambleside. After crossing the bridge, the rough road on the 
right must be taken. This path leads behind a farm-house, 
and above the stream, till it descends to the margin of 
^^Bigtial J^afee, which it skirts, through some rather boggy 
ground, which indicates the dryest weather for this walk. 
From the lake the path ascends, winding among the lower 
slopes of Loughrigg, till a considerable height is attained, 
where it makes a bold sweep, in the form of a grassy terrace, 
up the side of Loughrigg, commanding nearly the same view 
which is described (p. 79) as so glorious from Red Bank. 
From the middle of the terrace a mountain is seen in the 
far distance over Dunmail Raise. This is Saddlebaak. The 
terrace-walk ends at the top of Red Bank, whence the descent 



I 



■32E"alfe0 at M^mhlt^itiz. 109 



upon Grasmere is the same as that followed at p. 79. By 
taking a car, in the first instance, to Pelter Bridge, and then 
again from Grasmere to Ambleside, the walk is reduced to 
one of four or five miles. 

^Biis^ ©"lose, — If, instead of descending Red Bank, 
the traveller turns in the opposite direction, — away from 
Grasmere instead of towards it, — he will find himself near 
High Close (p. 77), and can refresh himself with the ^finest 
view in Westmorland,' as that panorama is reputed. From 
the foot of the ascent to High Close, the road is the same 
(reversed) as that detailed at p. 78. 



I ROADS TO GRASMERE. 

Before leaving the description of the north end of the 
Rothay Valley, it may be worth pointing out that there are 
three roads to Grasmere from Rydal, for the horse or foot 
traveller. The mail-road is by far the longest, as it sweeps 
round the base of the promontory which separates the two 
vales. The shortest of the three cuts is over the promontory 
at its highest part, — the path turning off steeply at the 
Rydal quarries, among the debris. There is a good deal of 
boggy ground that way ; but it lessens the distance consider- 
ably, and comes down finely upon Grasmere. The inter- 
mediate line is the celebrated Roman road, by which the 
"JKfisl^mg ©ate is passed, just above Grasmere. It parts 
off from the mail-road behind a wall, just on the Rydal side 
of the promontory. On the whole, it may be said that if the 
stranger desires an easy walk, he will follow the longest road ; 
if he wishes to save time, or for the finest views and the 
greatest wildness, he will take the shortest ; if he prefers 
traditional and romantic associations, he will choose the 
Roman road and the Wishing Gate. 



T^STalfes at M^vxblm^z. 



SKELGILL AND WANSFELL. 
(7 miles. ) 

In the immediate environs of Ambleside, the paths speak 
for themselves. For instance, every walker will explore the 
meadows between the town and the river, and cannot fail to 
notice the well-kept Nursery Gardens of Mr. Grier, where 
all the ferns of the region, and an unusually good show of 
flowers, are exhibited. But the stranger may possibly miss 
a beautiful walk through the woods on Wansfell, command- 
ing the finest views of the head of Winandermere, and of 
the mountain groups beyond. Almost every path leading 
up from the left of the old road between Ambleside and 
Waterhead leads into the woods : but the best is that which 
turns off, and upwards, just opposite a group of houses, in 
one of which lives Dove, the fishmonger. All such paths 
are rough and wet ; but this one is full of charms when once 
it enters the wood. The earliest anemones abound there, 
and many other wild flowers ; the brooks are clear and spark- 
ling; the rocky masses which crop out above, tufted with 
mosses and ferns, are an endless treat to the eye ; while the 
scene below and above is surprisingly fine ; — the views up 
both valleys, and along the lake, and into its bays and coves, 
all alive with boats ; or, in some seasons, as still as a mirror, 
reflecting even the distant mountain tops ; and far away the 
clustering peaks and graduated ridges of a little world of 
mountains. Step by step the scene varies, as the path follows 
the prominences or recesses of the hill side. It runs above 
^©obettest, and then strikes back from above the road, pass- 
ing through some fields, and issuing in the lane which leads 
down from Troutbeck to the mail-road at Lowwood. This 
j^ftelrjill walk is a great favourite with residents ; and it would 



"SZtTalfes at M^rrMz^itsz. m 

be a great pity that strangers should not enjoy it It can be 
well combined with the ascent of Wansfell from Lowwood. 

The best way of ascending ~32t? ansfell is from Skelgill. 
Having pursued the path described in the preceding para- 
graph, the stranger must turn to the left, in the field before 
he reaches jSkelgtU ^arm. He will pass an old hme- 
kiln,* and almost immediately above it he will find traces of 
a road. This he must follow through two or three enclosures 
and he will thus find gates or stiles all the way to the top. 
Wansfell is less steep on this side, and the ascent much less 
fatiguing than that described as above Stockgill. There can 
be no difficulty in finding the way, if the stranger will bear 
in mind that he need climb no walls. The walls are very 
high and very perplexing, and many persons have lost their 
way, and even been benighted, having got into a hopeless 
complication of fences. 



DOVE CRAGS, 
(lo miles.) 

The walk to Dove Crags, and the next we shall describe, 
is longer and more fatiguing than those hitherto mentioned ; 
but in neither of them is there any difficulty which need 
alarm a good walker. The time each occupies is from four 
to five hours. 

The way to Dove Crags is perfectly easy to find in clear 
weather, but a fog not only spoils the pleasure of the expe- 
dition, but renders the route difficult and even dangerous ; 
and, in bad weather, fogs are very apt to hang over the ridge 
of which Dove Crags form the centre. The tourist starts 

* As will be seen on reference to a Geological Map, there is a vein of 
Lime running through here. 



112 'jLSS'alkg; at .^mblesitie. 

by the road which takes him to ^toctim ^ritJ^e (p. 105). 
After leaving the bridge on the left, he pursues his way along 
an uneven grassy road, which is crossed by many streams, 
till, after a walk of a mile, he arrives at a gate. The road 
is plainly marked a little further on, but ceases at a large 
sheep-fold which he will see for sometime before he reaches 
it. After passing the fold, he must proceed in a north-east- 
erly direction, and make his way towards a crag which appears 
over the centre of the ridge which closes in the valley. The 
ascent looks easy enough, but lengthens out as he attempts 
it, and he is often tempted to believe that his guiding crag 
must belong to some range still further off. It is, however, 
one of the Dove Crags, and when he has passed a small tarn, 
half an hour after he left the fold, he finds himself not far 
from the foot of it. He must climb to the top, and then 
what a view opens all around him ! Below him he sees 
Brothers' Water, with Hartsop lying behind it ; then his eye 
travels over Place Fell and the whole of the Ullswater range, 
and he catches glimpses of the lake at Pooley Bridge end. 
Turning a little to the right, he perceives Kidsty Pike, High 
Street, and 111 Bell, the latter over the shoulder of the Red 
Screes. Looking back the way he came, he sees both ends 
of Winandermere, Blelham Tarn, Esthwaite, Coniston, and 
the sea at Lancaster and Duddon sands ; while, by turning 
more to the west, he catches many fine points of the Fairfield 
ridge, and one peep of Helvellyn. There are many direc- 
tions in which it would well repay him to explore. Perhaps 
the most tempting is the dropping down upon Brothers' 
Water, to which he will see a path far below him in a valley 
at his feet. He might ascend the Red Screes from this point ; 
or he might turn towards Fairfield, and, after walking along 
the ridge, regain the Scandale Valley at the sheep-fold, which 
all the time serves him as a valuable landmark. 



""S^tfalfeg at ,^mbl£2iti0. 113 



SCANDALE OR RED SCREES. 
(Six miles of hill-work). 

. Very few tourists ascend the Scandale or Red Screes, and 
yet it is an expedition well worth a great deal more exertion 
than is necessary to accomplish it. The traveller must pursue 
the road up the Kirkstone Pass till he has left the row of 
houses on the right, which are the last dwellings on the 
Ambleside side. Not long after, he sees a gate (the third on 
his left) through which he must pass. He immediately be- 
gins to ascend a steep, winding, grassy road, between stone 
walls. He gets fine views of Rydal and Grasmere as he 
proceeds, and more and more of the landscape opens around 
him. His road is clear enough. He has only to keep be- 
tween the walls so long as they run parallel : where they end 
he finds a stile which he must climb. He then keeps a wall 
on his left for some distance, and crosses a steep and rocky 
piece of ground, at the end of which he comes to what was 
formerly a gate, but which has been built up, and is now 
covered with stones on both sides. The wall must be climbed 
at this point. This built-up gate is in a line south-west of 
the cairn near the top, and it is important not to miss it, or 
the traveller may get entangled in walls. Once over the wall 
his way lies across the open fells to the ridge, in a direct line 
before him. From this point the way is easy, for the ground 
is smooth and gently sloping, and the top is in full view. 
There is a fine view from every part of the ridge, but it is 
from the summit (marked by a pile of stones) that the whole 
panorama opens before him. Below, lies Brothers' Water, 
with ridge after ridge branching off in all directions. Further 
off, Ullswater comes into view : while, by turning round, the 
stranger sees various peaks he has left behind, with patches 
of lake and sea visible between them. The view in this 

I 



114 Excursiong from 

direction is similar to what is described as seen from Dove 
Crags, but more extended, as this is a higher point. These 
Crags are visible from this summit, and an easy way of 
descent is found by making for the valley between them. 
The sheep-fold in Scandale soon comes into sight, and will 
again serve as a landmark. 



BY THE BRATHAY VALLEY TO HIGH CLOSE AND 

GRASMERE, AND BACK BY RYDAL. 

(17 miles). 

The stranger had better take an entire day for this Drive, 
if he can spare the time, and means to see Easedale at his 
ease; and there are other things to see which deserve a 
pause. 

The road to the right, after leaving the market-place, 
towards the Lake, is the one to be taken. Between Rothay 
Cottage and Rothay Bank, the road turns upon Rothay 
Bridge, whence there is a fine view or the valley, with the 
cul-de-sac of Fairfield closing it in to the north. Whether 
the vapours are gathering and tumbling in this basin, — 
the recess of Fairfield, — or whether every projection, streak, 
slide, and mossy tract, is clearly visible, that northern barrier 
is very imposing ; and perhaps more so to those who are 
most familiar with it, and can read its manifold weather 
signs and tokens. 

From ^Ettitj^ag ^rttige, this Excursion is fully described 
at 75 and following pages, to which the traveller is referred. 

After seeing the ^Kallg at ^gtJal (page 84) )g>elter 
Utilise, which spans the Rothay, is presently passed. 
That is the way to Fox How, — the grey house embosomed 
in trees, — at the foot of Loughrigg. He must not mistake 



,^mWEg;itie. 115 

for it the gem of a house that he sees, — the cream-coloured 
one, veiled in roses, with the conservatories beside it, just 
under the wooded precipice : that is Fox Ghyll. To the 
left there are good views of Rydal Park. Approaching 
Ambleside, the first house on the left is Lesketh How : the 
white house to the right is Meadow Bank : and the house 
on the rising ground behind the chapel is The Knoll. The 
gates on the left are those of Scale How : and the pretty- 
cottage next reached on the same side is called Low Nook. 
The stream to the right is the Stock, making its way to the 
river : and the old grey dwelling built above it is the ancient 
house which is considered the most curious relic in Amble- 
side of the olden time. The view of the mill, and the rocky 
channel of the Stock, on the left of the bridge, is one which 
every artist sketches as he passes by ; and if there is in the 
exhibition in London, in any year, a view at Ambleside, it is 
probably this. The Kirkstone road now joins the mail-road 
and the tourist finds himself on old ground, — in the market- 
place. 



TO THE LANGDALE VALLEYS, BY THE SKELWITH AND 
COLWITH FALLS, BLEA TARN, AND DUNGEON GILL. 
(17 miles). 
This Drive, which is one of the great favourites at Amble- 
side, commences with the Brathay Valley, which we have 
described at page 76, — past the new Church, and very soon 
coming to the familiar land-mark of [Etotjiag ^tibge^ to 
which we have had to allude many times. Now we are under 
the southern end of Loughrigg Fell, with Winandermere on our 
left, and the pretty gardened-cottages of Clappersgate on the 
right. On Brathay Bridge we have most beautiful river- 
scenery up and down, especially the former, with the grand 

1 2 



ii6 '^xtnxmm from 

old trees on either hand, and the tower of the church peering 
up prettily in the middle distance. The first turn on the right 
is towards the church, which is described at page 76. This 
road, on the south side of the river, is followed for a mile 
and a-half, when Spy Hill, with its commanding prospect is 
reached; then there is a descent to and over ^Jteltoit]^ 
^titJ^E. From this point the route is precisely similar to 
that described at 85 and following pages. 

As the return route joins the Brathay Valley about half-a- 
mile west of Skelwith Bridge, it is agreeably varied by 
travelling on the other side of the river. 



TO CONISTON, BY HIGH CROSS, AND BACK BY 

TILBERTIIWAITE. 

(19 miles.) 

This Excursion having been fully described in the Winder- 
mere Section, little remains to be said here. Our old ac- 
quaintance, ^Biotjiag Brtbije, is again to be found, as on the 
way to Langdale, page 76 but, instead of turning towards 
Brathay Church just after crossing the bridge, the main-road 
is pursued by Pull Wyke, after which there is a steep ascent 
westwards and away from the lake to Barngates. At page 
SS, the route from this point is described. 

Both Colwith and Skelwith Forces can be visited on re- 
turning. After the latter, the Brathay Valley is our home- 
ward route. 



TO THE FERRY AND HAWKSHEAD. 
(15 miles.) 
This circuit embraces some of the finest scenery in the 
district, and is everywhere interesting. We proceed as in the 



M^vxUz^itiz. 117 

last tour as far as the point where the roads to Coniston and 
Hawkshead diverge (p 116); here the latter should be 
followed for a short distance and then the first turn to the 
left is to be taken, this brings us to the lodge of Wray Castle, 
just beyond which is a gate, passing through which we soon 
come to the margin of the lake (p. 37). The course to the 
Ferry is now plain, by the water's edge. At the Ferry we 
hold to the right, taking the steep road up to Sawrey and 
then along the eastern shore of Esthwaite Water to Hawks- 
head. The particulars of this route from the Ferry to 
Hawkshead are given, in a reverse manner, at page 42. 
From Hawkshead the way home will be on the main-road. 



HIGH WRAY AND IRON KELD. 
(13 miles there and back,) 

The last route is be followed until we come to the lake 
under Wray Castle. After skirting its shore for a mile and 
a-half, nearly to Belle Grange, a road to the right will be 
seen, which will take the traveller through a wood, (the view 
from which is described at page 43 as being very fine), to 
High Wray ; . then under Latterbarrow. The Hawkshead 
road must then be followed for a little way, and then 
a turn to the left (by Outgate) will bring him to Sunny 
Brow. From here the lane pointing northward is to be 
taken, under the long rocky hill locally called Iron Keld. 
In two miles and a-half, this brings us to the beautiful 
view at Spy Hill, described at page 77, and the descent 
upon Skelwith Bridge, from whence our route home is by 
Brathay and Clappersgate. 

The very interesting and easy ascent of Iron Keld is 
described in the Coniston Section.

Excuteiione; from 



VALLEY OF THE STOCK, KIRKSTONE PASS, AND 
TROUTBECK. 
(II miles via Low Wood ; 14 via Cook's House.) 
The road to Kirkstone — a very steep one — issues out 
of Ambleside by the old church. Though pretty enough in 
its way, it is nothing to the magnificent scenery that stretches 
out beneath. You look back, and white singular Ambleside 
comes into view; higher up, the head of Winandermere ; 
higher still, you catch little Blelham Tarn, sparkling like a 
jewel dropt among the waste hills; higher still, Coniston 
Old Man and the wild western hills ; higher yet, Morecambe 
Bay : — Stockdale is some three or four miles in length, — 
and, before you descry the sea, with the vapoury track of a 
steamer perhaps stretching across it, you are on Kirkstone, 
and then your attention is taken captive by the immediate 
beauties of the scene ; Red Screes on the left, Caudale 
Moor on the right, and the wild mountain road that, with 
torrents for its companions, hurries down into Patterdale. 
At the inn, known as the highest inhabited house in Eng- 
land, we 'right about face'; and then take the road on the 
left, soon finding ourselves descending rapidly into the 
Troutbeck Valley, the chief beauties of which we have al- 
ready pointed out at p. 32. For his way home the tourist 
may either follow the road which skirts under Wansfell and 
joins the main-road at Towwood Hotel, or, crossing the 
valley to the church, he may follow that which will bring him 
to Cook's House, close to Windermere, a spot with which 
he will now be well acquainted. In both routes the views 
of Winandermere are equally fine. 



^^mWesitie. 119 



TO PATTERDALE. 
(9 miles). 
The route last described should be taken as far as Kirk- 
stone, here the road, (p. 54,) which is very steep, descends 
through wild scenery to Brothers' Water ; passing this, and 
entering the comparatively rich and fertile Patterdale, we 
cannot help lingering to admire the magnificent opening in 
the mountains behind, particularly to the left. The road is 
now easy and level, and in due time the tourist arrives at 
the Patterdale Inn. 



TO KESWICK. 

(16 miles direct ; or, via western side of Thirlmere, 20.) 
The main-road has already fallen under our observation 
at page 7 1 ; but, as the drive is not so long from Ambleside, 
there may be time to survey ^{jirlmere, and so make a 
satisfactory day's work. We accordingly, pass Rydal, Gras- 
mere, over Dunmail Raise, and arrive at the Horse Head, 
the little inn opposite Wythburn Chapel (p. 75,) which is 
about a mile further on. Here the traveller must decide on 
one of three courses, — as politicians are wont to do. He 
may go up Helvellyn ; or bowl along the high-road, straight 
through Legberthwaite, and immediately under Helvellyn ; 
or he may go on foot, or on pony, round the western side of 
the lake, which is known by the various names of Wythburn 
Water, Leathes Water, and Thirlmere. It is a choice of 
pleasures ; and he will ascend Helvellyn hereafter, if he does 
not now. Of the two lake roads, the rude western one is 
unquestionably the finest. The woods, which were once so 
thick that the squirrel is said to have gone from Wythburn 
to Keswick without touching the ground, are cleared away 



I20 Excursions torn 

now ; and the gloom in the scene is from the mass of Hel- 
vellyn. The stranger leaves the mail-road within a mile of 
the Horse Head, passes by the cottages called by the boast- 
ful name of the City of Wythburn, and a few farm-houses, 
and, soon emerging from the fences, finds himself on a 
grassy level under the Armboth Fells, within an amphitheatre 
of rocks, with the lake before, and Helvellyn beyond, over- 
shadowing it. The rocks behind are feathered with wood, 
except where a bold crag here, and a cataract there intro- 
duces a variety. 

^ The best wooded ravine and one of the finest in the Lake 
Country is Lancey Gill ; the first stream you arrive at comes 
down from it. Although we have travelled up it a long 
distance in the fairest company, it is not easy climbing for 
ladies. But it well repays a little toil. Nowhere, not even 
at Lodore, are rocks more picturesquely scattered, more 
beautifully mossed, more drooped over by greenest foliage 
than here : very soon you come to what appears to be a 
complete cul-de-sac^ — a wall of rock, not only rendering pro- 
gress impossible, but setting you wondering where the stream 
can possibly come from ; the tourist here has to take a 
perfect right angle, and proceeds through a deep and narrow 
chasm which ladies had better not strive to pass ; there is a 
circuitous route up the cliff on the left-hand, by which the 
ravine can be again reached and the expedition resumed. 
The whole of the way is beautiful : the beck looks like some 
gallery of Creswick's pictures, with nook and fall, and bower 
and rock-work, endlessly diversified. At last the rocky 
summit of a deep pool is reached, which has been the 
watery home, for several minutes, of more than one over- 
active young gentlemen of our acquaintance, who slipped in 
during their perilous passage over the left-hand ledge yonder. 
No sane person, with life uninsured, would venture upon it ; 



M^vMz^itit. 121 

the cliff, no easy matter, must now be climbed, and the head 
of the ravine arrived at by the left bank ; there is a water- 
fall both above and beneath the tourist, and a view of King 
Helvellyn and the nobles of his court at Thirlmere, which 
will well repay him for his trouble. Upon his return, he 
should visit the Rocking Stone upon the right, from whence 
is a still more splendid prospect/ 

Arriving again at the bottom of the Gill, we find a clear 
pool in the midst of the grass, where, if the approaching 
tread be light, the heron may be seen fishing, or faithfully 
reflected in the mirror. The track leads by the margin of 
the lake, and through a shady lane and a farm-yard, to the 
bridge by which the lake is crossed. The water is shallow 
there, between two promontories; so that piers are easily 
built, with two wooden bridges at intervals ; and thus is 
solved what is to novices a great mystery, — how there can 
be a bridge over a lake. There is another mystery just be- 
hind, under Armboth Fells, — a haunted house. Lights are 
seen there at night, the people say ; and the bells ring ; 
and just as the bells are set off ringing, a large dog is seen 
swimming across the lake. The plates and dishes clatter ; 
and the table is spread by unseen hands. That is the pre- 
paration for the ghostly wedding feast of a murdered bride, 
who comes up to keep her terrible nuptials. There is really 
something remarkable, and like witchery about the house. 
On a bright moonlight night, the spectator who looks towards 
it from a distance of two or three miles, sees the light re- 
flected from its windows into the lake ; and, when a slight 
fog gives a reddish hue to the light, the whole might be 
easily taken for an illumination of a great mansion. And 
this mansion seems to vanish as you approach, — being no 
mansion, but a small house lying in a nook, and overshadow- 
ed by a hill. The bridge being crossed, another bit of lane 



122 Excursions from 

leads out upon the high-road near the clean little inn, the 
King's Head, and within view of the Vale of St. John. 

One would hke to know how often the * Bridal of Trier- 
main ' has been read within that vale. The Castle Rock, 
in its disenchanted condition, is a prominent object in 
approaching the vale from Legberthwaite, or by the road just 
described; and there are lights and gloomy moments, in 
which it looks as like as may be to a scene of witchery, — 
now lit with sunshine when the range to which it belongs 
is all in shadow; and now perversely gloomy, because 
there is a single cloud in the sky. The narrow vale is full 
of character and charm, from end to end ; and at its northern 
extremity it comes out upon a spot of strong historical in- 
terest. The village of Threlkeld will, by its name, remind 
one of the good Lord Clifford, the story of whose boyhood 
is familiar to all readers of Wordsworth. That place is, 
indeed, the refuge where there is a local tradition that, though 
he never learned to read or write, during the twenty-four 
years he spent in keeping sheep, his astronomical knowledge 
was considerable, and so interesting to him that he improved 
it by study after he came to his estates. The road through 
St. John's Vale and Threlkeld will, however, be followed by 
the traveller on another occasion : to-day we must not miss 
that view from Castlerigg, which made the poet Gray long 
to go back again to Keswick. 

From the entrance to the Vale of St. John at Legber- 
thwaite it is five miles to where the view opens, which pre- 
sently comprehends the whole extent from Bassenthwaite 
Lake to the entrance of Borrowdale, — the plain between 
the two lakes of Bassenthwaite and Derwent Water present- 
ing one of the richest scenes in England, — with the town 
of Keswick, and many a hamlet and farmstead besides ; and 
the two churches, — the long, white, old-fashioned Cros- 



M^mhlmtit. 123 

thwaite Church, in which Southey was buried, and the new 
red-stone church of St. John, with its spire, and the school- 
house and pretty parsonage at hand. These were built by 
the late John Marshall, of Hallsteads, — a name which is 
more spoiled than dignified by any conventional addition. 
The church and parsonage were occupied by the husband of 
one of his daughters ; and now he and his son-in-law lie 
buried there together. Skiddaw is here the monarch of the 
scene. That mountain mass occupies the north of the view. 
Bassenthwaite Lake peeps from behind it : then the plain of 
Derwentwater stretches out to the lake of that name ; and, 
at the southern end, the Borrowdale mountains are grouped 
with wonderful effect, Castle Crag occupying the most con- 
spicuous place. On the eastern side, to the left of the spec- 
tator, Wallabarrow Cragg rears its crest, and unfolds woods 
below ; while the opposite side of the mountain is guarded 
by Cat Bells and other mountains, bare and pointed, and 
possessing a character of their own. A steep winding road 
descends into the valley; and at the foot of the hill lies 
Keswick. 

ASCENT OF FAIRFIELD. 

(12 miles of mountain work.) 

The tourist, during his sojourn at Ambleside, should make 
a point of ascending some of the neighbouring mountains. 
The ascents of Loughrigg and Wansfell, being within a short 
distance and easy access, have been already noticed in the 
Walks, but we wish now to conduct the traveller to some of 
the higher mountain tops. And here we would offer a few 
general remarks on mountaineering which may prove useful 
to the stranger in the expeditions he is about to make. 

In all mountain expeditions let him go forth early, es- 
pecially in hot weather, as he will thus get over his first 



124 J3Lsc£nt at ^airSelti, 

climb in the cool of the morning ; he should have a stout 
stick in his hand, or, better still, one of the mountain-poles, 
which he will find of great service in helping him over the 
rough places ; provision for the day in his knapsack or his 
pocket, is indispensable. 

The mountain up which we proprose to take the traveller 
first, is the one which he will often have noticed rising 
grandly above Ambleside, and the ascent of which it is best 
to commence with as the excursion is safe, not over-fatiguing, 
practical for a summer-day, and presenting scenery as charac- 
teristic as can be found. The whole of this great horse-shoe 
of mountain is called Fairfield, — is in fact the Fairfield 
Range, but each summit has a distinctive name. Let us be- 
gin with Nab Scar, the end which overlooks Rydal Lake : 
the next summit is Harron Crag, ; then Green or Great 
Riggs ; then Fairfield proper (the summit) ; and, last of all, 
Rydal Head. The top of Fairfield is 2,950 feet above the 
sea level, and Rydal head 2,910. The name Rydal' Head 
originally belonged to the valley shut in by the summits, but 
has lately been used for the height above it. 

The stranger should ascend to the ridge, either through 
Rydal Forest, (for which leave is requisite, and not always 
easily obtained,) or by the Nook, the road to which is at the 
back of Scale How, (see plan,) which anybody will show 
him. The Nook is a farmhouse in a glorious situation, as 
he will see when he gets there and steps into the field on the 
left to look abroad from the brow. He then passes under 
its old trees, to where the voice of falling waters call him 
onward. Scandale Beck comes down its rocky channel, 
close at hand. He must cross the bridge and follow the 
cart-road, which brings him out at once upon the fells. 
What he has to aim at is the ridge above Rydal Forest or 
Park, from whence his way is plain, — round the whole cu/- 



from JSLmblesibe* 125 

de-sac of Fairfield, to Nab Scar. He sees it all ; and the 
only thing is to do it : and we know no obstacle to his doing 
it, unless it be the stone wall which divides the Scandale 
from the Rydal side of the ridge. These stone walls are an 
inconvenience to pedestrians, and a great blemish in the eyes 
of the stranger. In the first place, however, it is to be said 
that an open place is almost invariably left, up every moun- 
tain, the rover can but find it : in the next place, the ugliness 
of these climbing fences disappears marvelously when the 
stranger learns how they came there. In the olden times, 
when there were wolves, and when the abbots of the sur- 
rounding Norman monasteries encouraged their tenants to 
approach nearer and nearer to the Saxon fastnesses, the shep- 
herds were allowed to enclose crofts about their upland huts, 
for the sake of browsing their flocks on the sprouts of the 
ash and the holly, with which the uplands were then wooded, 
and of protecting the sheep from the wolves which haunted 
the thickets. The inclosures certainly spread up the moun- 
tain-sides, at this day, to a height where they would not be 
seen if ancient customs had not drawn the lines which are 
thus preserved ; and it appears, from historical testimony, that 
these fences existed before the fertile valleys were portioned 
out among many holders. Higher and higher ran these in- 
closures, — threading the woods, and joining on upon the 
rocks. Now, the woods are for the most part gone ; and 
the walls oifend and perplex the stranger's eye and mind, 
by their unsightliness and apparent uselessness ; but it is a 
question whether, their origin once known, they would be 
willingly parted with, — reminding us as they do of the times 
when the tenants of the abbots or of the mihtary nobles, 
formed a link between the new race of inhabitants and the 
Saxon remnant of the old. One of these walls it is which 
runs along the ridge which bounds Rydal Park. There may 



126 ..Ascent of ^atrfielti 

be a gate in it ; if not, he must get over it ; and if he does 
so, high enough up, it may save another dimb. The nearer 
the ridge, the fewer the remaining walls between him and 
liberty. Once in the forest, Christopher North's advice 
comes into his mind, — unspoiled by the fear — only too 
reasonable in the lower part of the park — of being turned 
out of the paradise very summarily. * The sylvan or rather, 
the forest scenery of Rydal Park,' says Professor Wilson, 
* was, in the memory of living man, magnificent ; and it 
still contains a treasure of old trees. By all means wander 
away into these old woods, and lose yourself for an hour 
or two among the cooing of cushats and the shrill shriek of 
startled blackbirds, and the rustle of the harmless slow-worm 
among last years' beech leaves. No great harm should you 
even fall asleep under the shadow of an oak, whilst the 
magpie chatters at safe distance, and the more innocent 
squirrel peeps dow upon you from a bough of the canopy, 
and then, hoisting his tail, glides into the obscurity of the 
loftiest umbrage.' Ascending from these shades, through 
a more straggling woodland, the stranger arrives at a clump 
on the ridge, — the last clump, and thenceforth feels himself 
wholly free. His foot is on the springy mountain-moss : 
and many a cushion of heather tempts him to sit down 
and look abroad. There may be a frightened cow or two, 
wheeling away, with tail aloft, as he comes onwards; and 
a few sheep are still crouching in the shadows of the rocks, 
or staring at him from the knolls. If he plays the child 
and bleats, he will soon see how many there are. It is 
one of the amusements of a good mimic in such places to 
bring about him all the animals there are, by imitating 
their cries. One may assemble a flock of sheep, and lead 
them far out of bounds in this way ; and bewildered enough 
they look when the bleat ceases, and they are left to find 



from M^mhlmitit. 127 

their way back again. It is in such a place as this that the 
truth of some of Wordsworth's touches may be recognised, 
which are most amusing to Cockney readers. Perhaps no 
passage has been more ridiculed than that which tells of the 
* solemn bleat ' of 

* a lamb left somewhere to itself, 
The plaintive spirit of the solitude.' 

The laughers are thinking of a cattle-market, or a flock of 
sheep on a dusty road ; and they know nothing of the effect 
of a solitary bleat of a stray lamb up on the mountains. If 
they had ever felt the profound stillness of the higher fells, 
or heard it broken by the plaintive cry, repeated and not 
answered, they would be aware that there is true solemnity 
in the sound. 

Still further on, when the sheep are all left behind, the 
stranger may see a hawk perched upon a great boulder. He 
will see it take flight when he comes near, and cleave the 
air below him, and hang above him, — to the infinite terror, 
as he knows, of many a small creature there, — and then 
whirl away to some distant part of the park. Perhaps a 
heavy buzzard may rise, flapping from her nest on the moor, 
or pounce from a crag in the direction of any water-birds 
that may be about the springs and pools in the hills. There 
is no sound, unless it be the hum of the gnats in the hot sun- 
shine. There is an aged man in the district, however, who 
hears more than this, and sees more than people would, per- 
haps, imagine. An old shepherd has the charge of four 
water-gauges which are set up on four ridges, — desolate, 
misty spots, sometimes below but often above the clouds. 
He visits each once a month, and notes down what the gauges 
record ; and when the tall old man, with his stafl", passes out 



128 jgLscent of ^atrficlti 

of sight into the cloud, or among the cresting rocks, it is a 
striking thought that science has set up a tabernacle in these 
wildernesses, and formed a priest among the shepherds. 
That old man has seen and heard wonderful things ; has trod 
upon rainbows, and been waited upon by a dim retinue of 
spectral mists. He has seen the hail and the lightnings go 
forth as from under his hand ; and has stood in the sunshine 
listening to the thunder growling and the tempest bursting 
beneath his feet. He well knows the silence of the hills, 
and all the solemn ways in which that silence is broken. 
The stranger, however, coming hither on a calm summer-day, 
may well fancy that a silence like this can never be broken. 
Looking abroad, what does he see ? The first impression 
probably is the billowy character of the mountain groups 
around and below him. This is perhaps the most striking 
scene to a novice ; and the next is, the flitting character of 
the mists. One ghostly peak after another seems to rise out 
of its shroud; and then the shroud winds itself round 
another. Here the mist floats over the valley ; there it reeks 
out of a chasm ; here it rests upon a green slope ; there it 
curls up a black precipice. The sunny vales below look 
like a paradise, with their bright meadows and waters, and 
shadowy woods and little knots of villages. To the south 
there is the glittering sea ; and the estuaries of the Leven 
and the Duddon, with their stretches of yellow sands. To 
the east, there is a sea of hill-tops. On the north, Ullswater 
appears, grey and calm at the foot of the black precipices ', 
and nearer may be traced the whole pass from Patterdale, 
where Brothers' Water lies invisible from hence. The finest 
point of the whole excursion is about the middle of the cul- 
de-sac, where, on the northern side, there are tremendous 
precipices overlooking Deepdale and other sweet recesses 
far below. Here, within hearing of the torrents which 



torn M^mhlm'tit. 129 

tumble from those precipices, the rover should rest He 
will see nothing so fine as the contrast of this northern view 
with the long green slope on the other side, down to the 
source of Rydal Beck, and then down to Rydal Woods and 
Mount ; but, the further he goes, the more amazed he will be 
at the extent of the walk, which looked such a trifle from 
below. He is now 2,745 feet above the sea-level; and he 
has surely earned his meal. If the wind troubles him, he 
can doubtless find a sheltered place under a rock. If he 
can sit on the bare ridge, he is the more fortunate. 

Waking out of a reverie, an hour after dinner, he sees that 
the sun is some way down the western sky. He hastens on, 
not heeding the boggy spaces, and springing along the pathless 
heather and moss, seeing more and more lakes and tarns 
every quarter of an hour. In the course of an hour he sees 
ten. Winandermere, and little Blelham Tarn beyond, he 
saw first. Ullswater was below him to the north when he 
dined; and, presently after, a tempting path guided his eye 
to Grisedale Tarn, lying in a pass from Patterdale to Gras- 
mere. Here are four. Next come Grasmere, Easedale tarn 
above it, in its mountain hollow ; then Rydal, of course, at 
his feet; and Elterwater beyond the western ridges, and 
finally, to the south-west, Esthwaite Water and Coniston. 
There are ten. Eight of these may be seen at once from at 
least one point — ^ab j©car, whence he must take his last 
complete survey ; for from hence he must plunge down the 
steep slope, and bid farewell to all that hes behind the ridge. 
The day has gone like an hour. The sunshine is leaving 
the surface of the nearer lakes, and the purple bloom of the 
evening is on the farther mountains ; and the gushes of the 
yellow light between the western passes show that sunset is 
near. He must hasten down, — mindful of the opening be- 
tween the fences, which he remarked from above, and which, 

K 



130 X^ountain ,^^ccniQ 

if he finds, he cannot lose his way. Pie does not seriously 
lose his way, though crag and bog make him diverge now 
and then. Descending between the inclosures, he sits down 
once or twice to relieve the fatigue to the ancle and instep 
of so continuous a descent, and to linger a little over the 
beauty of the evening scene. As he comes down into the 
basin where Rydal Beck makes its last gambols and leaps 
before entering the Park, he is sensible of the approach of 
night. Loughrigg seems to rise : the hills seem to close him 
in, and the twilight to settle down. He comes to a gate and 
finds himself in the civilised world again. He descends the 
green land at the top of ^Eistnal ^Eionni; comes out just above 
Wordsworth's gate; finds his car at the bottom of the hill, — 
(the driver beginning to speculate as to whether any accident 
has befallen the gentleman on the hills) ; — is driven home ; 
and is amazed, on getting out, to find how stiif and tired he 
is. He would not, however, but have spent such a day for 
ten times the fatigue. He will now certainly ascend Hel- 
vellyn, and every other mountain that comes in his way. 

Those travellers who cannot achieve the whole of this 
excursion should at least ascend ^J^ah J^car. After passing 
Rydal Mount and the farmhouse above it, the road leads 
through a gate. There is then a barn to be passed, and, 
immediately afterwards, a turn to the left must be taken. 
This leads up a steep grassy road between two walls. On 
arriving at the top of this path the way is clear of fences, 
and there is no difficulty in reaching the summit. It may, 
however, be as well to mention that the easiest ascent is made 
by following a narrow path in an easterly direction till two 
scraggy ashes, the only trees on this part of the fell, have 
been passed, and then turning towards the summit. In this 
way the steepest part is avoided. This is about 6 miles.* 



from .Ambles toe* 131 



ASCENT OF HELVELLYN. 

Approaching the mountain from Ambleside, there are 
two ways to climb Helvellyn ; — the one by Grisedale 
Tarn ; the other from Wythburn. That from Wythburn is the 
shorter, but it is steeper than the first — the track beginning 
at once to climb the hill opposite the Horse's Head. 
The gushing stream which crosses the mail-road near 
the Horse's Head, comes down from Brownrigg's Well, 
— the spring which refreshes the traveller on his way up or 
down, — bursting from the mountain-side within 300 yards 
from the summit. There is no difficulty in this route, be- 
yond the steepness, as the track, — used by ponies, — is well- 
marked all the way up. To do this from Ambleside and 
Grasmere the carriage-road is to be taken as far as \JW - gtJj^ 
burn, which is described at page 119. 

For the ascent by Grisedale Tarn, take the road to Kes- 
wick as far as the fifth milestone, which is at the foot of Dun- 
mail Raise, Grasmere; a little beyond the milestone is a 
house, on the right, covered with ivy. Turn through a gate 
into a lane on the side of the house nearest Keswick. You 
soon emerge by the side of a stream,^ though at some height 
above it ; after crossing this at some distance up, the path 
ascends steeply the grassy slopes of jSeat j^antiaL This 

* There is a pretty waterfall just below here called Tongue Gill Force, 
and more * material ' for good pictures may be found further up the stream. 

The tourist will find it a good plan in making the ascent of Helvellyn 
to go up by way of Grisedale Tarn and descend by Wythburn, where he 
can order a carriage to meet him. The descent into Patterdale should 
be made by Swirrel Edge, (see plan,) at the foot of which the piece of 
boggy ground between the two ' Edges ' has to be crossed until the path 
from Striding Edge is joined ; from this point there is no further difficulty. 

K 2 



132 J^scent oi ^elbellgn i 

path is well marked all the way to a wall which runs along 
the ridge of the hill ; in this wall there is a gate, after passing 
through which you descend to ©risetiak Jl^atm The ascent 
of ^Bielbellgn is continued from this point by the steep zig- 
zags above the foot of the Tarn. When at the top of these 
the traveller must follow the ridge of the mountain and he 
will soon make out the summit. 

There are precipices on the east of the summit ; but its 
mossy plain slopes gently towards the west. No mountain 
is, we believe, so often climbed. Its central situation ren- 
ders the view attractive on every account ; it is very con- 
spicuous ; and it is not difficult of ascent. According to the 
Ordnance Surveyors, its height is 3,118 feet above the level 
of the sea ; that is, 5 7 feet higher than Skiddaw, and rather 
more than 100 feet lower than Scawfell Pike. There are 
two cairns on two summits, not far apart, from between 
which, in an angle in the hill, the best view of the north is 
obtained. The men, (as such piles of stones are called) 
mark the line between Cumberland and Westmorland. 
Northwards the view is bounded by the Scotch mountains, 
with the Solway at their feet. Nearer stands Saddleback, 
with Skiddaw a little to the left. Kepplecove Tarn lies 
below, with Catchedecam on the right. Eastwards, Red 
Tarn lies immediately below, between its two solemn preci- 
pices. Ullswater shines beyond, its nearer bank fringed by 
Gowbarrow Park; and Crossfell closes in the view afar. 
The Troutbeck mountains here peep over Striding Edge. 
Kirkstone and Fairfield rise to the south; and, over the 
latter, there is a peep of Winandermere ; and sometimes, in 
clear weather, a glimpse of Lancaster Castle. Esthwaite 
Water and the sea in Morecambe Bay are seen at the same 
time. Blackcombe is caught sight of through Wrynose Gap ; 
and the Coniston range and Langdale Pikes lead the eye 



from .M^mblz^itiz. 133 

round to the superior summits at the head of Wastdale and 
Buttermere. Even Honister Crag is seen, in a hollow to the 
left of Catbells. In clear weather the Isle of Man can be 
distinctly made out. Derwentwater is not seen ; nor from 
the higher ' man/ either Thirlmere or Bassenthwaite ; though 
the two last are visible from the lower Man. Six lakes are 
seen besides many tarns : — Ullswater, Winandermere, Esth- 
waite Water, Coniston, Bassenthwaite, and Thirlmere. 
Angle Tarn is particularly conspicuous, while its neighbour, 
Hays Water, is hidden in its hollow under High Street ; the 
streams it sends down to Brothers' Water are however very 
conspicuous when the sun is upon them. 

There are several ways of descending Helvellyn. The 
traveller who has come up from Wythburn, if he is going 
home to Ambleside the same day, may go down by Grise- 
dale Tarn and Grasmere ; or, if he has ascended by the 
latter route, he may drop down upon Wythburn and take 
the coach homewards. 

If the walk is to be extended to [j^attettnale and Ulls- 
water there are three ways to be recommended : ^rsf, to 
©risebale ^^xn, as before, where the turn is to the left, and 
thence by the distinct path down the valley. (Ambleside to 
Patterdale, 15 miles). Second; very near the summit, a 
path will be seen which, on the slope of ©Tatstge ^ant, 
aims for ^EtetJ JUarn; from whence, a common being traversed 
for a quarter of a mile in a southerly direction, we take to 
the slopes of the ©tisetiale "^alleg, and eventually join the 
Tarn route. (Ambleside to Patterdale, 13^^ miles). The 
t/iird route aims almost due north along the ridge for about 
a mile, and then turns sharply round upon ^K.epel iSTobe 
51? am which is seen the whole way. Then, there is a horse- 
track down the ©lentilitimg "yFalleg to Patterdale. (Amble- 
side to Patterdale, 12^ miles). 



134 X3Elotintam .^scents 

If Jv.eslxiicfe be the object of the walker who is now on 
the summit of Helvellyn, he has choice of routes ; first, the 
one to Wythburn, as before described, by which the walk 
from Ambleside to Keswick would be 21 miles; second, 
there is a track on the slope of the hill which leads in a 
north-westerly direction to the inn at 5I^{)irl0|JOt, where the 
coaches for Keswick call, making altogether about 19 miles. 
Those who want to shorten the walk will of course take 
the latter route. 



ASCENT OF LANGDALE PIKES. 
(23 miles, including 6 of mountain work). 

This is a very enjoyable excursion from Ambleside or 
Grasmere, and, as the ascent of the Pikes is not arduous, 
most people may undertake it with little or no fatigue. 

From Ambleside, the road through Clappersgate, and by 
the Brathay Valley (which has already been described several 
times) should be taken. The valley must be left half a mile 
before reaching ^©ketoit]^ ^rflige, proceeding in the direction 
of Loughrigg Tarn and ^E^lterixrater, and then forward up the 
valley of @teat J^angtiale until Dungeon Gill New Hotel 
is reached. Thus far the excursion may be done with car- 
riage and horse. 

From the Hotel the path to Dungeon Gill Force is taken 
as far as the turn to the fall ; just above this, some grass zig- 
zags may be seen ascending the hill ; if these are followed, 
the way to jSticWe 5I?am is plain. On arriving there, go round 
the eastern end, from whence there is an easy climb to 
the higher summit — ^attistin Stickle (2401 feet); and 
when on this the pedestrian has only to cross the depression 
to ^ifte 0* ^ticMe, the lower point, (2323 feet). The 
view is not extensive, but it is interesting, and the tourist 



^* from M^mhlzmtit. 135 

will find himself well repaid for his trouble. The precipitous 
rock, overshadowing Stickle Tarn, stretching in a crescent 
form between the two Pikes is called ^abeg .^^tk. 

Another mode of ascent is to cross the stream just above 
the Dungeon Gill, and then ascend the grassy slope on the 
other side until almost under the rock of Harrison Stickle ; 
here a path tending to the right may be easily made out, 
and following this the summit can be reached without fur- 
ther trouble. 

The homeward journey from the inn, might very well be 
by Blea Tarn and Jl^tttle Jl^angtiale. This journey is 
23 described — the reverse way — at pages 85 and 86. 



ASCENT OF SCAFELL. 
(29 miles, including lo of mountain work). 

The ascent of j^cafell is sometimes made from the Sty 
Head Pass; sometimes from Lingmell ; and sometimes from 
Langdale, whence the path meets that from Sty Head on 
Esk Hause. 

For the ascent from Langdale, which can be accomplished 
in about seven hours, up and down, the tourist should drive 
to Dungeon Gill Hotel, as in the excursion to Langdale 
Pikes on the preceding page. From thence he will follow 
the cart-tract to J^angtialc ^eati, where there is a rough path 
on the left up ^ossett ©ill, the Stake road being on 
the right. It at once catches the eye ; and the invariable 
question of the stranger is which of the two is the Stake. 
Care should be taken in ascending by Rossett Gill to keep on 
the left side of the stream. Those who wish to avoid this 
scramble — for scramble it is — or who are making the ascent 
on ponies, will find another path higher up the hill-side, join- 



136 j3-scent of j^raWL 

ing the other at the top of the Gill. The track, which can easily 
be made out by observing the piles of stones which are placed 
at intervals to mark the way, then leads by „^ngle 5Barn to 
Ssk JK:ause. The point at which the path from Langdale, 
and that from Sty Head join Esk Hause* is called Fudder's 
Brow. It is a well-known place of meeting for all the guides 
and shepherds in the district. This is truly a glorious moun- 
tain-walk. From Esk Hause, there is a singular view, com- 
posed of three lines of landscape. One begins with Borrow- 
dale, lying immediately below, and extends to Derwentwater 
and Bassenthwaite, past Skiddaw, in full glory, and over the 
whole intervening plain to the Solway and the Scotch moun- 
tains. This is the north-western view. The opposite, or 
south-eastern one begins with Langdale, and proceeds with 
the opening of the Brathay valley and Winandermere, till 
it is closed in by Ingleborough, in Yorkshire. The third,' 
and intermediate view, is down Eskdale, past its verdure and 
its cataracts, past the sands, past lonely Black Combe, to the 
broad sea. When we were on Esk Hause, the spectacle of 
these three lines of landscape was remarkable. Towards 
Keswick, the atmosphere was thick, just to the degree that 
gave a visionary character to the long perspective. The 
lake of Derwentwater was hardly distinguishable from its 
shores, so that the wooded islands and the town of Keswick 
lay as if in air, still and unsubstantial. In the direction of 
Easedale, all was bright and glittering ; while from Langdale 
and the head of Borrowdale the white mists came tumbling 
out towards us, as if to stifle us ; and nothing could be seen, 
except at intervals, when a whiff of wind disclosed long 
sweeps of the sides of the valleys, and stretches of the streams 
and fields below. It is these changes that give a singular 
charm to this mountain district. The residents of the valleys, 
in their occasional ascents to these heights, never see the 



from .^mWesttie. 137 

scene twice alike, — the great landmarks themselves being 
scarcely recognisable unless it be by certain incidents of 
their forms. 

At Esk Hause, the traveller will determine which of the 
summits composing the great mass of Scafell he will ascend. 
There are four of them which collectively go under that 
name ; — the most southerly is called simply Scafell ; Sca- 
fell ^ikz, which is sixty feet higher, and the highest moun- 
tain in England (3,208 feet) ; and the lower hills, Lingmell 
and Great End, — the last being the northernmost, fronting 
Borrowdale. Aiming for the Pike, the route is now almost 
due west, holding a little to the left towards the foot of the 
great mass of ©teat ^ nil, on reaching which there is a faint- 
ly-marked path and guiding stones in a south-westerly direc- 
tion. The way now roughens, the passage being over a field 
of massive stones and debris. The Ordnance Surveyors have 
set up a staff on a pile of stones on the highest peak ; so that 
there need be no mistake about that for the future. The two 
summits, Scafell and Scafell Pikes, are about three-quarters of 
a mile apart, in a straight line ; but the great chasm between 
them, called XSicfeleticire, renders a wide circuit necessary. 
There have been foolhardy persons who have passed Mickle- 
dore, without losing their lives ; and there are strangers, almost 
every season, who attempt the ascent without a guide. These 
last usually pay the penalty of their rashness by hours of un- 
easy wandering and excessive fatigue. When they think they 
see their way clearly enough, they are pretty sure to find them- 
selves brought up on the verge of a chasm, and compelled 
to ' try round ' many times before they succeed. If darkness 
comes on, there is nothing -to be done but wait for daylight 
where they are. Another reason for having a guide is that 
the mountains around are not recognisable by their forms, 
— so great is the change caused by the aspect they present 



13^ j^scmt of jScafell 

from above. With map and compass they may be made out ; 
but the summit being greatly exposed to the wind, it is diffi- 
cult to make use of these — and much time and trouble will 
be saved by having the necessary information ready at hand. 

The summit is bare of everything that grows, except moss. 
Not a blade of grass is to be seen : and it follows that the 
herdsmen and shepherds never have to come here after their 
charge. Blocks and inclined planes of slate-rock, cushioned 
and draped with mosses, compose the peak. As to what is 
seen from it, — the best thing a stranger can do is still to copy 
portions of that ^ Letter to a Friend ' which Mr. Wordsworth 
published many years ago, and which is the best account of 
the greatest mountain-excursion in England. The weather 
was, however, unusual. The guide said, when on the summit, 
* I do not know that in my whole life, I was ever, at any 
season of the year, so high upon the mountains on so calm 
a day.' It was the seventh of October. 

* On the summit of the Pike,' says the letter, * which we 
gained after much difficulty, there was not a breath of air to 
stir even the papers containing our refreshment, as they lay 
spread out upon a rock. The stillness seemed to be not of 
this world. We paused, and kept silence to listen, and no 
sound could be heard. The Scafell cataracts were voiceless 
to us ; and there was not an insect to hum the air. The 
vales which we had seen from Esk Hause lay yet in view • 
and, side by side with Eskdale, we now saw the sister-vale 
of Donnerdale terminated by the Duddon Sands. But the 
majesty of the mountains below and close to us is not to be 
conceived. We now beheld the whole mass of Great Gable 
from its base — the den of Wastdale at our feet — a gulf 
immeasurable ; Grasmoor, and the other mountains of Crum- 
mock ; Ennerdale and its mountains ; and the sea beyond ! 
While we were gazing around, " Look," I 



from J^lmblesibe, 139 

exclaimed, " at yon ship upon the glittering sea ! '' " Is it a 
ship?" repHed our shepherd-guide. "It can be nothing 
else," interposed my companion. " I cannot be mistaken ; 
I am so accustomed to the appearance of ships at sea." 
The guide dropped the argument ; but before a minute was 
gone, he quietly said, " now look at your ship — it is changed 
into a horse.'' So it was ; a horse with a gallant neck and 
head. We laughed heartily ; and I hope, when again inclined 
to be positive, I may remember the ship and the horse upon 
the glittering sea ; and the calm confidence yet submissive- 
ness of our wise man of the mountains, who certainly had 
more knowledge of the clouds than we, whatever might be 
our knowledge of ships. 

* I know not how long we might have remained on the 
summit of the Pike, without a thought of moving, had not 
our guide warned us that we must not linger, for a storm 
was coming. We looked in vain to espy the signs of it. 
Mountains, vales, and sea were touched with the clear light 
of the sun. " It is there ! " said he, pointing to the sea 
beyond Whitehaven, and there we perceived a light vapour, 
unnoticeable but by a shepherd accustomed to watch all 
mountain-bodings. We gazed around again, and yet again, 
unwilling to lose the remembrance of what lay before us in 
that mountain solitude ; and then prepared to depart. 
Meanwhile the air changed to cold, and we saw that tiny 
vapour swelled into masses of cloud, which came boiling 
over the mountains. Great Gable, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw 
were wrapped in storm ; yet Langdale and the mountains in 
that quarter remained all bright in sunshine. Soon the 
storm reached us ; we sheltered under a crag; and almost 
as rapidly as it had come, it passed away, and left us free to 
observe the struggles of gloom and sunshine in other quar- 
ters. Langdale had now its share ; and the Pikes of Lang- 



I40 ^cafell 

dale were decorated by two splendid rainbows. Before we 
again reached Esk Hause, every cloud had vanished from 
every summit.' 

We cannot do better than stop with these auspicious words. 
May the tourist who reads this on the Pike see every cloud 
vanish from every summit 1 



A gentleman who ascended Scafell Pike on the 9th of 
July, 1857, set out from John Gillbanks' homestead, (now 
the New Hotel), at the foot of the Langdale Pikes, and 
something short of a mile off the head of that magnificent 
mountain-valley. He accomplished the ascent, with no great 
expenditure of muscular effort, in less than three hours and a 
half, by a line of route leading up Rosset Gill, at the head 
of Langdale, and thence past Angle Tarn to Esk Hause. 
The adventure, he says, presented no special difficulty, 
* though,' he adds, * it proved a lost one as regards my main 
object : for, on planting myself on the culminating point 
which was to unfold to me such a vision of majesty and 
beauty, I found myself standing on a speck of rock amid 
an ocean of cloud and mist. There was nothing for the eye 
to see, — nothing for the memory to retain, — nothing above, 
around, beneath me (for aught my closed sealed up senses 
revealed to me, or aught perhaps that the dulled drenched 
fancy and feeling of the moment suggested) nothing but 
mist, mist, illimitable mist, through which *^ even a hawk's 
keen eye " might not pierce a score of yards. Our lo triumphe 
was a poor affair indeed, and of briefest duration. But the 
descent proved a more serious matter, and had more of the 
excitement of incident about it ; for my guide — though he 
had been thirty-four times on the summit of Scafell — got 
puzzled and perturbed amid the surging vapours, and my 
allowance of mind and muscle was approaching exhaustion 



before we had fairly resolved our perplexities, and got once 
more upon the rough but welcome descent into Langdale by 
Rosset Gill.' 



AMBLESIDE TO STRANDS AND WASTWATER, BY 
WRYNOSE AND HARDKNOTT. 
(25 miles). 
There are three routes from Ambleside to j^trattbs. First, 
by the steamer to Lake Side Station, thence by the rail- 
way through Ulverston to Drigg or Seascale, at which 
places carriages may be obtained to take travellers on to 
Strands. Secondly, by Coniston and Broughton and Esk- 
dale ; visiting on the way Stanley Gill, — the grand waterfall 
of the district ; — a distance of thirty-two miles. Thirdly, 
the shortest, (that which we are about to describe,) by Cockley 
Beck ; but it is fit only for good walkers, in fair weather. 
There is no reason, however, why ladies should not achieve 
it by taking ponies or a car, which they will quit in the steeper 
and rugged parts. ^ 

* It is a great pity the road over Wrynose Gap is not made more 
passable for conveyances, as it is by far the shortest route to Eskdale, 
Wastwater, and indeed all the north-western part of the district, from 
Ambleside and Windermere ; the materials are all at hand, and a very 
little expense would render what is at present, and what in other districts 
would be intolerable for any use, into a good carriage-road equal to that 
over Kirkstone Pass. The people of the district are, however, so wedded 
to old crags and so loath to spend their money, even in what would so 
obviously improve their property, that we suppose it will be for the 
strangers to teach them what is the law and their duty. One of the best 
things that could come to the Lake District would be the formation of a 
society for the purpose of insisting on the proper management of ancient 
roads like this. There can be no doubt the magistrates would heartily 
co-operate with hotel-keepers and others who might take this work in 
hand. This road over Wrynose and Hardknott is perhaps the oldest in 
the district ; and, within the memory of living man was the highv/ay 
from London to Whitehaven ; and, when we look at the map, it is ob- 
vious that a good road in that direction might still be of great value ;

Our route has been described in the Langdale excursion 
as far as the turn to the right which leads to Blea Tarn, 
— viz., the road by Clappersgate and the Brathay Valley, in the 
latter of which, however, the traveller must keep the right- 
hand road. Passing Skelwith Bridge, he will follow the new 
road, which turns off to the right almost immediately after 
crossing the bridge. Then there is a climb of about a mile, 
and a short descent before turning steeply to the right towards 
Colwith Bridge. <Srotoit5i ZRotce, a little further on, will 
make itself heard and seen. It tumbles from a height of seven- 
ty feet, and the adjuncts are beautiful. One mile further along 
the winding road or lane, ^angtiale )^ike0 comes into view, 
with '^^S^dlizxlum swelling up grandly to the south of it. 
About a mile further, there is a gate where the road divides into 
two ; — the straight-forward one leading to Blea Tarn and 
Great Langdale ; and the left-hand one, which our traveller 
must follow, leading to 'JEitll ^oot, and the old road from 
London to Whitehaven, which was the only route before car- 
riers' carts found their way into the region. Fell Foot was the 
house of entertainment whence the pack-horse cavalcade 
began the ascent, or where they stopped to congratulate 
themselves on having accomplished the descent. The ascent 
of "y^Sffrgnose from this point is long and rather steep : but 
the views behind become grander with every step. The 
travellers are now in Westmorland ; but at the three ^i^ixt 

indeed, one might probably say with safety that there is no tract of 
country in England so broad as that between the highway to Whitehaven 
via Keswick, and to the same place via Broughton, without an inter- 
mediate thoroughfare. The Wastwater district, which contains some of 
the grandest scenery in the country, is now almost virtually closed to the 
strangers who have not time or inclination for a long railway journey, 
owing to the want of a good road to it ; from the Winandermere side of 
Bowfell, were the facility offered, we are sure the hundreds who pass 
from Ambleside to Keswick would only be too glad to turn aside and 
behold this the grandest part of the district.

Stones at the top, where three counties meet, they will step 
into Lancashire, in order to leave it for Cumberland at 
Cockley Beck Bridge, within three miles further on. We are 
glad that a spirited citizen of Ambleside, to whom his neigh- 
bours are under great obligations, has erected a stone pillar 
at the spot where the shire stones are, that the junction of 
counties may not be overlooked — as it easily might be before 
— by the unobservant traveller. Young tourists, who happen 
to have long limbs, may enjoy the privilege of being in three 
counties at once, by setting their feet on two of the three 
stones, and resting their hands on the third The stream 
which is now on the right, divides Lancashire from Cumber- 
land ; and Westmorland is left behind. 

We know nothing wilder in the district than the next two 
miles. These are the desolate hills in which the ^^utitJon 
and the ^E.&k take their rise ; and ©'oritleg ^eck is the spot 
where the Duddon must be left, to cross over to the Esk. 
There is a farm-house near the bridge at the bottom, where 
horses can be refreshed, while travellers sit down by the 
stream to dinner. 

A melancholy and harassed traveller once took this way, 
whose adventure is still talked over in Eskdale and Borrow- 
dale. A party of tourists, among whom were two sisters, 
were on the heights, intending to cross Esk Hause into 
Borrowdale, and to spend the night at Seathwaite, — the 
first settlement there. Now there is, as we have seen, another 
Seathwaite on the Duddon; and mistakes frequently arise 
between them. On Esk Hause, one of the ladies lost sight 
of her party behind some of the rocks scattered among the 
tarns there, and took a turn to the right instead of the left. 
A shepherd of whom she enquired her way to Seathwaite 
pointed down the Duddon Valley ; and that way she went 
till she found herself at Cockley Beck, when the old shep- 



144 Kt0m ^^mblestoe o'bzx "SM^tgnose 

herd-farmer who Hved there was getting his supper in the 
dusk of the autumn evening. He used his best courtesy to 
induce her to stay till daylight ; but she was bent on going 
at once, — so great would be her sister's, terror. As she 
would not be persuaded, the old man went with her, putting 
his crust into his pocket. It was dark, and the lady was 
weary ; and she was not aware what she was undertaking. 
After a long struggle, she fainted. The old man was afraid 
to leave her, lest he should not find her again : he succeeded 
in reaching water without losing sight of her white dress. 
He dipped his crust and brought water in his hat to bathe 
her face. She revived, ate the crust, and strove onwards, — 
persevering on her weary way till between one and two in 
the morning, when she met her sister and party coming from 
Seathwaite in Borrowdale, with a dozen lanterns to search 
for her. She gave her guide ' a one pound note ' (it was so 
long ago as that) ; and afterwards sent him two more. The 
whole family connection of that lady will remember for ever 
that there is a Seathwaite on each side of Esk Hause. 

From Cockley Beck, the road climbs the side of ^Katti^ 
fenott, and from the highest point commands a view of the 
sea. The descent into PS.e;fet(ale.is charming, — the ravine to 
the left, through which the infant river flows, being beautifully 
wooded, and the whole valley, with its few hamlets and many 
sheep, lying open as far as the sea. In three miles from 
Cockley Beck, the bridge over the Esk is passed; and 
Stanley Gill is less than three miles further. Scafell and 
all that group of summits, are in view to the right, during 
the descent : and to the left, ^trfter Korce is seen dashing 
over the rocks. Boot comes next, and then Dalegarth and 
^tanleg ©tlL^ After crossing the Esk, and passing the little 
inn at Boot, the road runs above the river till at the King

of Prussia inn, it turns out of Eskdale, and crosses into 
X^Eitterbale* Then there is a descent to cross the Mite ; and 
another ascent ; and a descent again to pretty Santon Bridge 
on the winding Irt. Instead of passing over the bridge, how- 
ever, the road to the right must be taken, which leads, in 
two miles, to Strands village, a mile and a half from Wast- 
water. 



MOUNTATN PATH TO WASTDALE HEAD. 

There is a beautiful walk of six miles across the fells from 
Boot to Wastdale Head. The track passes ^urnttt0or ^arn 
flowing out of which is a stream, which finds its course down 
to Boot. This stream may serve as a guide to the traveller 
but he will save himself much distance and a good deal 
of bog, if he can find the landmarks, which the country 
people use for pointing out the way. He crosses a stream 
at a picturesque watermill soon after leaving ^oflt, and 
follows the path through one or two gates. When he finds 
himself on the fells, he will look out for an old thorn tree. 
There are three, and he must pass them all, leaving them 
on his right-hand. After he has left the third behind, 
he will, if he continues to walk in the same direction, 
soon come in sight of the tarn. It would be well if some 
more lasting landmarks were substituted for these old 
trees, two of which are already dead, and the third does 
not look as if it would long survive its fellows. The chief 
interest of this walk is in the latter portion. The road crosses 
the stream as it issues from the tarn, on the eastern side, and 
then the way lies between ^^cafcll and the jSctees, Wast- 
dale Head and Wastwater come into sight during the descent, 
which is made by a path used by peat-cutters whose huts 
are passed by the roadside.

CONLSTON OLD MAN. 

(l2 miles to summit from Ambleside). 

The ascent of Coniston Old Man can be made from 

Ambleside by driving to Coniston, (page ii6,) from whence 

the route is the same as that given in the Coniston Section, 

to which the traveller must refer. 



AMBLESIDE OR GRASMERE TO KESWICK, BY THIRL- 
MERE AND WATENDLATH. 

(lyi miles, including 6 of hill-work.) 

There is another way to Keswick besides that of the 
carriage-road, which the pedestrian might like to follow. 
Just before reaching "V^^'gtljburn, the traveller will trace 
a mountain path wmding up the hill on the western side of 
the valley. It leads to ^H^arrap ^nxn, from which point he 
may make his way across the fells to Blea Tarn and thence to 
Watendlath and Borrowdale. It is a beautiful walk of five 
miles from Wythburn to Rosthwaite, but it must only be 
attempted in fine weather, as there is much bog to be crossed. 
Harrop Tarn is small, and only interesting from the fine rock, 
Tarn Crag, which overhangs it. There is no trace of a path 
from Harrop to Blea Tarn, but the way is easily found with 
the help of a compass. The traveller must keep in a north- 
westerly direction. There is a stream which serves as a guide 
for part of Jhe way, but which disappears before the ridge is 
reached. He must then keep a bold crag, which is a conspicu- 
ous object from the first, on his left He will also see some 
piles of stones set up by the Ordnance Surveyors ; and the 
ridge must be crossed between the crags and one of these piles. 



from .^mlilesitre, 147 

pQIea ^^xn, which is only about a mile and-a-half distant 
from Harrop Tarn, soon comes in sight. From the high ground 
on the west there is a fine view of the Borrowdale mountains, 
of Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite, of Skiddaw, and the 
whole of the Helvellyn range. A stream issues from the 
narrrow end of the tarn and serves as a guide to Watend- 
lath. The valley and tarn of ""JiS^Tatctttilatlj will be described 
later on, but there is no point from which they appear to 
greater advantage than from that at which they first come 
into sight by this route. The stream becomes rocky as it 
approaches the tarn, and it is well to leave the bank and 
look out for gates in the fences. There is one a little to the 
left of the stream, and the traveller can find his way thence 
through fields and a lane to the farmhouse. From that point 
there is a road to Keswick by Barrow (5 miles), and to Ros- 
thwaite (2 miles). 



ARM BOTH TO WATENDLATH. 
(3 miles of hill work.) 
Behind the hamlet of Watendlath a path ascends the fells. 
This leads to Armboth and may as well be described here. 
It is well-marked at each end, but there is a part of the 
ridge too boggy to retain any trace of the road. The 
direction to be taken is nearly due east, — or west, if starting 
from the Thirlmere side. In our own attempt to find this 
path from Watendlath to Arm'both, we were directed by a 
gamekeeper, who was well acquainted with the fells, to keep 
our eyes fixed on a ' larch planting ' on the side of Helvellyn, 
and to walk steadily in that direction. We did so, and had 
no difficulty in regaining the path as soon as we had left the 
boggy upland. But, after all, in this, as well as when the 
opposite direction is pursued the compass is the safest guide.

WALKS AT GRASMERE. 
As the visitor will at once see, there must be many tempt- 
ing Walks about the lanes, fields, and copses of ©^rasmere 
which cannot be conveniently embraced in tours from Amble- 
side. Indeed the valley has, within the last few years, become 
such an important resort that, were it not so near to Amble- 
side, we should have been tempted to make it a centre from 
which to make excursions ; but, we think all purposes will 
be served by here indicating the Walks which seem to be 
the special property of those sojourning at Grasmere. 

I. The Walk round by the conspicuous white inn, the 
Swan, will often be taken. That inn had the honour of 
providing Scott with a daily draught of something good, 
when he was, in his early days, the guest of Wordsworth and 
his sister at Grasmere, whose board was conscientiously 
humble to a degree, which, as they used to tell, did not suit 
the taste of their guest. By some device or another, Scott 
managed to pay a daily visit to the Swan without the know- 
ledge of his friends. But, when he, Wordsworth, and Southey, 
were one day mounting their ponies at the Swan, with the in- 
tention of ascending Helvellyn, the host cried out to Scott, 
'Why, sir, yev come see-en for yer glass teh-day.' It was a 
complete escape of the cat out of the bag ; but Words- 
worth was not one to be troubled by such a discovery. No 
doubt he took the unlucky speech more serenely than his 
guest. 

The tourist must not, however, take it for granted that the 
natives here are constantly guilty of making mistakes of that 
kind ; well-considered plans which might astonish our great 
folks, being sometimes matured in these vales. 



~^M^n\H at ©rasmere. 149 

A landlord at this present Swan was in difficulties ; and 
had occasion to study the law of bankruptcy, cautiously 
making observations how the ^ process ' operated in other 
cases. At length his scheme was complete, — he judged by 
previous examples that a satisfactory result might be realized 
by what is called * going through the court' He now called 
in a reliable friend to a private conference, and solemnly 
communicated what he intended to do : — * Al tell the what,* 
says he, * as gane teh Cook it [do as Cook did] : ^ as gane 
teh pay seben-en-six-pence it' pund, en weear a white wesket 
en a gold chain.' 

II. Another favourite walk is up the side of ^T^^ab j^cat, 
further north than the descent from the Roman road, which 
is described in the Walks from Ambleside. The path may be 
seen from below, and traced to a considerable height, winding 
among rocks and trees. 

III. There are also some charming walks about jSilbet 
]]fe^0bJ and the western side of the lake. The finest of these 
is found by following the ridge from Easedale Tarn, instead 
of descending by the regular path. There is no difficulty 
about finding the way, as the lake is in sight the whole time. 

IV. ^Bielm ^rag should be ascended if the stranger has 
leisure for a climb. The view from the top is fine, though 
not so commanding as from higher summits. The Grasmere 
lake and valley, the Easedale valley, and the surrounding 
heights, seen from the Crag, are well worth some exertion ; 
but the chief interest of the expedition is in the remarkable 
structure of the summit. The traveller will find something 
very like a small crater there, and in it are caverns that will 
hold seven or eight persons. There are hollows from these 



150^ "iLia^alfts at ©ragmcre* 

caves into which, it is said, persons have been lowered with 
ropes, without touching the bottom. The easiest ascent is 
made by following the road towards ^j^asetiale and turning 
off to the right at a point where a zig-zag track, between 
walls, up the side of the Crag, comes down into the valley. 

V. There is a mountain-road striking out to the left, be- 
tween Helm Crag and Steel Fell. The eye may follow it up for 
a considerable distance. It leads to ©teenup E^Jge, and 
thence into Borrowdale, but is seldom traversed by any but 
natives as it does not offer any peculiar attractions. 

VI. Besides Mmx (Mlilk ©ill, in Easedale, there are at 
least two pretty "^^^atetfalls at Grasmere, one of which — 
I^OVLQUZ ©til force — we mentioned in the ascent of H el vellyn, 
as approached from the path to Grisedale Tarn. The pretty 
ivy-covered cottage about a mile towards Raise Gap, on the 
right-hand of the mail road, must be looked out for. The 
path is just beyond and behind the house, and descends 
towards the stream, and the waterfall. — The other Fall is 
reached by the lane immediately opposite the said ivy-covered 
cottage. The traveller must proceed down till the bridge is 
crossed, and then turn to the right. In about half a mile 
another bridge is reached, and the fall will be found a few 
hundred yards further on up the left fork of the beck, under 
the grounds of the villa, called Helm Side. 

VII. There are several X3Elountain=patIjs to the west of 
Grasmere, the easiest and most commonly-used being that 
which leaves the main-road at the Wyke and ascends the hill 
by the margin of a wood. It then passes the rifle-butts and 
goes over the shoulder of the hill, where the ridge is shortly 
reached, and you drop down upon Chapel Stile, in J^antjtiale, 



"^^Itfalte at ©rasmere. 151 

There are some grand views in the former part of this walk. 

VIII. Another path, running between that last mentioned 
and the Red Bank road, diverges just before reaching Dale 
End. This leads over less elevated ground into Langdale at 
Chapel Stile and is generally taken by persons ascending 
^angtiale iJP^tfees from Grasmere. — After reaching Chapel 
Stile, the high-road up the valley must be followed until Dun- 
geon Gill New Hotel is reached (p. 134). There the traveller 
must take the peat-road, which will be pointed out to him, to 
^ticfele 5E^am, — famous for its trout, and therefore in great 
favour with anglers. Its circular basin, brimming with clear 
water, lies finely under the steep rocks of yPdHsti^ ,.^tft» 
There is nothing amidst this mountain scenery more inter- 
esting than these tarns. Their very use, — namely, to cause 
such a distribution of waters as may fertilize, without inun- 
dating, the lands below, -is one which enhances the 
sense of their beauty, by suggesting the admirable provision 
of nature which they are intended to serve. After rain, if 
the waters came down all at once, the vales would be flooded 
— as we see, very inconveniently, by the consequences of im- 
proved agricultural drainage. The tarns are a security, as far 
as they go ; and at present the only one. The lower brooks 
swell after rain, and pour themselves into the rivers, while the 
mountain-brooks are busy in the same way, emptying them- 
selves into the tarns. By the time the streams in the valley are 
subsiding, the upper tarns are full, and begin to overflow ; 
and now the overflow can be received in the valley with- 
out injury. As for their aspects, under all lights, and in all 
weathers, they must be studied on the spot, for no description 
can afford any impression of the truth to those who merely 
see them on a passing tour. 

^arrijson j^tickle (the higher of the Langdale Pikes), 



152 '^^M'a\k& at ©ra^mere, 

is seen from this point. The summit of the Pike is 2,401 
feet above the level of the sea. The height is not very great ; 
but the view is interesting, because it is unlike most others 
that can be obtained, — extending as it does, over the level 
country to the south and south-east, while it commands in 
other directions the loftiest peaks in the district. Passing the 
way up the Pike, the moorland path leads over into 'J^mt^ 
bale, and down upon Easedale Tarn. There is also a way 
down into Borrowdale, by crossing Codale Fell, and getting 
into the Stake road. 

IX. The ascent of ^^fe^elbellgn is not so often made from 
Grasmere as from Wythburn, which is nearly four miles 
further on. From Grasmere it is much longer; but still 
some persons well acquainted with the locality prefer this 
way, because the views are fine, and the ascent is more 
gradual. The high-road is left about half a mile north of 
the Swan inn, just after crossing the bridge, (p. 131).

Since the opening of the Railway to Coniston, tourists 
have sometimes begun their circuit of the Lake District from 
this point. Local authorities differ as to the relative advant- 
age of beginning here or at Windermere. The question 
may well be left open, and we will only state that the chief 
recommendation in favour of the Coniston route is that 
Furness Abbey may be visited by the way. 

The Kumess ^Eiaitoag from the Camforth Junction 
passes along the Duddon sands to Foxfield, where the Conis- 
ton line branches off, while the Whitehaven line skirts the coast. 
This latter railway offers facilities for visiting the numerous 
Small bathing places along the coast, and is also an easy mode 
of approach to the more distant lakes, Ennerdale and Wast- 
water. It is left at Seascale and Drigg, as before noticed, 
to convey travellers to the latter ; and St. Bees is only eight 
miles from Ennerdale. 



15^ ©Tonfetom 

The Lake of Coniston, commonly called ^onfeton 
"^ZE ater, is in the district lying between Winandermere and 
the Duddon, which has already been mentioned as formerly 
belonging to Furness Abbey. Several fine views of it may be 
obtained as the traveller approaches by the railway. At the 
southern end, almost before the line approaches the lake, and 
lying between it and the shore, is the picturesque little 
Beacon Tarn. It is so small and overgrown with trees as to 
be easily missed, but is worth looking out for. The Station 
stands high above the little town of Church Coniston, 
through which the traveller must pass to get to the Water- 
head Hotel, which will be found near the lake. This inn, 
built under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. Marshall, is most 
comfortable. 

Coniston Lake, like Winandermere, is flanked by low hills 
at the south end, but is enclosed by magnificent mountains at 
its head. Situated near the latter, the house and grounds of 
Mr. Marshall enjoy a position unrivalled in the district. 



WATERHEAD. 

(4 Miles round). 

The lanes and field-paths at the north-east end of the head 
of the lake are very charming and afford grand views of the 
bold hills and crags on the opposite shore. Tent Lodge 
and its associations are noticed in our description of the 
drive round the lake. The sketcher should enquire for 
Rawlinson Ground, where he will find a good example of 
of an old farm-cottage which he may think worthy of a 
comer in his book. 

YEWDALE. 

(To the Yew Tree and back, 5 Miles). 
This Valley, with its grey rocks cushioned with heather up 



'^^M'alk& at ©Txintston. 157 

to their summits, stretches away northwards from the head of 
the lake, into a gorge where the mountains overlap. One 
of the crags there is called Raven Crag : and it is said that 
a pair of ravens live now, there or somewhere near. It 
is to be hoped that, now the eagles are gone, the last 
ravens will not be destroyed or scared away by the shot of 
the miners, or of rash sportsmen, who are too apt to try 
and bring down every bird they see. 

There is a pleasant walk through the meadows which may 
be taken on the outward journey. ^Sii^ '^t'mti^lt 
Farm, with its long row of clipped yews, must be passed, 
and at the next farm, just beyond, a foot-bridge will be 
found which leads into the field where stands the aged tree 
which gives its name to the vale, and which some un- 
scrupulous local chronologist stoutly maintains to have been 
coeval with the deluge. It must, in any case, be of vast 
antiquity, for the girth of its huge trunk at five feet from the 
ground is 25 feet. 

Those who can manage a stiff but short climb should re- 
turn by 3? am ^Ifeiolxr, which is approached from the other 
side of the main road. On the summit there is a grand view 
of the valley and lake. The descent is gradual towards 
Waterhead. The whole detour would add about a mile to the 
length of the walk. 



THE COPPER MINES. 
(4 miles, and the underground work. ) 
The Old Man, eleventh in height of the mountains of the 
district (2,633), famous for its Copper Mine, towers above 
the little town of Church Coniston. To this mine will 
probably be one of the first walks of the sojourner at 
Coniston. It is about two miles up a steep cart-road,

commencing at the Black Bull Inn. After passing the 
pretty villa of Hollywath, the ground rises more rapidly, and 
you soon reach the fell gate, through which you may pass, 
taking the road to the left, which lies between a steep, 
rocky fell-side and a high and dry stone wall, the gateways in 
which aiford delightful glimpses of the many beauties of the 
vale and village. At the point where the wall ends, you 
have in its place a deep rugged ravine, fenced by a row of 
large boulders, along the left side of the narrow road, while 
the beck with its hue of soap suds brawls and foams along 
its jagged course at the bottom. About half way up the 
Gill, you find a respectable cascade of about forty feet in 
height, where the water, much broken by the irregularities 
above, and by the ledge from which it falls, spreads itself 
out like a large white apron ^gathered' a little at the 
waist. A hundred yards higher is another force, and, higher 
still, is a third, where the stream is split into three by two 
sharp projecting rocks, and which, about half way down, 
falls upon a sort of slanting shelf, whence, white as butter-milk, 
it makes a second fall at right angles with the first, and alto- 
gether, although it is of no great altitude, forms a very 
interesting object of contemplation. 

' And now, occupying the upper end of an oblong basin, 
which you have entered by a gap in the southern end, you 
see ' a little town ' of sheds, offices, workshops, and water- 
wheels, presenting, with the clatter of machinery issuing con- 
tinuously therefrom, a most astounding contrast to the silence 
and solitude of the surrounding wilderness. These are the 
works belonging to the extensive ©'opper X^tttes of Conis^ 
ton. The mines themselves are of great antiquity, having 
been worked by the Romans during their earliest occupation 
of this country. There is good reason, therefore, to believe 
they have been in operation, with greater or less success, for 



'^Mulk^ at ^oni&ion. 159 

something like two thousand years. Nor need we suppose 
any intermission throughout this long period — unless it be 
one at the time of Oliver Cromwell, when Sir Daniel Flem- 
ing, the proprietor, becoming mixed up with the troubles of 
the age, caused the mines to be closed for a few years. After 
the restoration, however, operations were resumed and con- 
tinued with varying energy and profit, until the advent of the 
present management. At that period, the number of miners 
had dwindled down to two or three men working on their 
own account ; but, since then, matters have been very differ- 
ent. For upwards of twenty years the mines have kept several 
hundreds of people in constant employment, and have made 
very large returns to the present enterprising company. 

^ Formerly, most of the operations were carried out by what 
are called * tribute-workers,' the workmen giving a certain 
portion of what they raised to the proprietary. Under this 
system some of them realized large sums. But, for 
several years, nearly all the underground work has been 
done by bargain, a party of men undertaking to excavate a 
given number of fathoms in a certain locality, and in an 
assigned direction, at so much per fathom, and the results of 
their labours being brought out by waggons along the levels, 
or horizontal workings, and by * kibbles' — a kind of large 
strong bucket — up the shafts. 

* High up the mountain side, you may notice a solitary 
water-wheel, which, from having nothing visible from below 
near to it, appears to be spinning away like a child's toy 
mill, without aim or object. It is at the top of the main 
shaft, and is employed in hoisting those kibbles to horse- 
level — a part of the mine so called because the ore is there 
drawn out by horses. That wheel was, some years ago, the 
scene of a terrible casualty. It was noticed that the man in 
charge of it — a respectable old man named Millican — was 



i6o "JiSJ'aHtg; at ®rontst0n» 

not at his post ; and, on examining the wheel, it was found 
he had fallen into its hollow interior, and was literally torn 
to shreds by its rapid revolution. It is to be hoped that the 
wheel is now so well fenced as to render a similar horror 
impossible. 

' Having arrived at the works, if you wish to explore the 
subterranean operations of the mines, I * believe you may ob- 
tain permission, and a suit of proper clothing, by making 
application at the office. Like a presentation at court, a 
descent into a mine requires a special dress for the occasion. 

* The most frequented entrance to the most extensive part 
of the mines is by the horse-level already named, where, 
with candles and a guide, you make your way beneath an 
arch of living rock, so low as to compel you to move along 
with lowered crest until you arrive at the * Cobbler's Hole,' 
a tremendous chasm, from which a vein of copper has been 
wrought, extending to a point above the high water-wheel 
you saw on the hill-side. When you have advanced about 
a quarter of a mile into the level, you find the shaft, which 
reaches from the said water-wheel through all the workings 
down even to the lowest part of the mine, and by which the 
kibbles containing the ore are hoisted to a few fathoms over 
your head, and emptied into a large hopper, under which the 
waggons are run to be loaded. 

* The shaft is descended by a series of ladders, with wooden 
sides and iron steps, and a platform, or landing, is reached 
at every few fathoms. Diverging occasionally from, but 
generally following the line of the shaft, you continue, some- 
times crawhng down ladders, sometimes stepping cautiously 
across the landings, and passing several levels in your des- 
cent — as, for example, one at a depth of twenty fathoms, one 
at thirty-five, one at fifty, one at seventy, and, if you choose 
* A. Craig Gibson, author of 'Ravings and Ramblings round Coniston.' 



-y^^alfts at CTonfotom i6i 

deeper still, you may find other workings at ninety, one 
hundred and twenty, and one hundred and fifty fathoms — 
giving a depth of nine hundred feet from the place where 
you entered the mine, or something over eleven hundred 
from the top of the shaft. In most of these levels you may 
find men at work, generally elevated upon a platform called 
by the miners a ' bunning,' — probably hound in, — the little 
stage being supported by strong beams jammed between the 
walls of rock. The men have a somewhat wierd appear- 
ance — the darkness in which they pursue their daily toil 
being made barely visible by two twinkling candles plastered, 
with a dab of clay, against the rock, or, occasionally, in front 
of the workman's hat, and frequently burning very badly 
for lack of a sufficient supply of oxygen. The attitudes of 
the men as they ply their melancholy toil are rather pictur- 
esque, holding up and turning the jumper with the left hand, 
whilst they keep driving it into the flinty rock with a hammer 
held in the right. Having bored the holes to a sufficient 
depth — say about eighteen or twenty inches — they clear 
out the borings or fragments, proceed to charge with gun- 
powder, and then, having uttered one or two warning shouts, 
the precise sound of which it is impossible to realize, but 
which consists of the simple monosyllable * fire,' they light 
the match and retire to await the result of the ^ shots.' The 
ever-recurring thunder of these blasting reports reverberating 
along the dismal levels — the pauses between them being 
filled up by the rattling of the kibbles and chains in the 
shafts — renders these mines by no means the peaceful place 
that the denizens of upper air may suppose them to be, and 
to visitors of ordinary nervous organization, has a bewilder- 
ing, not to say an astounding effect. After the explosion the 
men return to their working, and note carefully the effects of 
the shots, breaking up the larger fragments, and carefully 

M 



1 62 ©Toniston '^^M'aizx. 

beating down any loose pieces lodged about the sides. They 
then select the most suitable * lofe,' and recommence boring. 
Three of these borings and blasts are considered a fair day's 
work in this hard rock, the men working in * shifts ' of eight 
hours each. 

And now, having visited the depths of the mines, and 
witnessed the mostimportant and most common underground 
operations ; and, moreover, being nearly stifled with powder 
smoke, you are ready to return to the blessed light of day, 
and * heaven's untainted breath,' and may clamber up the 
long ladders by which you descended. And, though you 
will have seen nothing sufficient to convey an adequate idea 
of the extent of these mines, for the hills around are almost 
honey-combed by their works, yet you will know enough to 
understand the nature of copper mining. 

It is but justice to the management, more especially to 
those who have the direction of the underground operations 
of these mines, to call attention to the fact that, considering 
the number of people employed, and the very dangerous 
character of the employment, there are remarkably few 
fatal accidents amongst them, and of those few the greater 
proportion is occasioned by carelessness, and sometimes by 
disregard of well-known regulations on the part of the suf- 
ferers themselves. 



THE LAKE, 
(lo miles.) 

Coniston Water now boasts of its steamer ; and instead, 
as of old, taking a small boat and tugging at the oars, you 
can go to the very water-foot at the cost of no muscle but 
that of the iron one of a steam engine. 

Having embarked on board the ©ontiola (as the steam- 



©'onfeton "ySEater* 163 

yacht is called), you proceed with all comfort and all 
despatch on your voyage down the lake. Leaving the bay 
in which stands the handsome steep-roofed edifice which 
serves as a boat and summer house to the hotel, you round 
the low gravelly point covered with native shrubs ; and then, 
after noting at the back of it the enormous banks of fine 
blue sand brought down by the beck from the copper mines, 
deposited in the still waters of the lake, and afterwards 
thrown up, by the storms of winter, in high ridges along 
the low-lying shore ; — you turn your eyes northward to the 
head of the lake, while fresh beauties come to view in con- 
stant succession. Beyond, or above the "^\]Sf aterfjeatr, 
stands the residence of Mr. Victor Marshall, a member 
of the family of princely manufacturers of that name in 
Leeds. It is surrounded by perhaps the finest demesne 
in the lake district, if the most beautiful combination of 
many of the elements of both natural and artificial loveliness 
can establish its superiority ; for nowhere else will you have 
seen wood and water, hill and valley, green sward and purple 
heather, rugged crag and velvet-lawn, grey rock and bright 
blossoming shrub, waving forest and spreading coppice, 
brought under the eye at once in such magnificent proportion 
and in such bewildering contrast. Over the western side of 
these fair grounds of Monk Coniston Park you may note 
the picturesquely rugged and broken summits of Holme 
Fell and Raven Crag at the head of Yewdale — and, nearer 
to you, but still more to the west, the wild, precipitous and 
lofty range of Yewdale Crags ; over them the long ridge of 
Henn Crag ; higher still the broad summit of Wetherlam ; 
and, as you wind your way down the lake, the lofty undu- 
lating chain of heights which connect this last with the Old 
Man, now plainly visible in all his hoary grandeur and 
magnificence. The eye turns next to the romantically-situated 

M 2 



164 ^onfeton TiSfattr* 

village, one part of which is scattered over the face of the 
declivity, while another nestles at the feet of the steep, 
craggy hills, wonderfully dispersed, as you see, — ^ here 
a scattering and there a clustering, as in the starry heavens,' 
— each separate detachment, whether consisting of one or 
many houses, having its separate designation, but the whole, 
taken together constituting the village of Church Coniston. 

On the Monk Coniston, or eastern shore, you may note 
^ent J^dbge, where the laureate hved, How Head, Lane 
Head, Bank Ground, where one of the monks of Furness 
found a home, before the ' thing called the Reformation ' 
occurred, the farm of Townend, once occupied by the eldest 
daughter of Wonderful Walker, the low-roofed dwelling 
called Coniston Bank, and, finally the appropriately so- 
called villa of ^tanttOiOCiti, formerly the residence of the 
foremost hand in England in the beautiful art of wood 
engraving, then of Gerald Massey, the poet, and now of 
John Ruskin. 

Reverting to the western, or Church Coniston shore, 
nearly opposite to Brantwood, in the apex or, to speak 
nautically, the bight of its own noble bay, between a row of 
lofty sycamores and the wide spread woods of the old park, 
stands ©^ciniston ^Kall? for a long time the seat of the 
ancient family of Le Fleming. It is now, a farm-house, with 
a considerable portion of the old house removed — the ban- 
queting hall, in which, of old, knightly revellers swallowed 
* potations pottle deep ' in honour of high-born ladies, being 
converted into a barn, and a very commodious barn too. 
The most striking feature of the hall now is its massive ivy- 
clad chimneys. 

Meanwhile the Gondola glides onward, and carries you 
rapidly down the ever-narrowing lake. On the eastern, or 
left side, the natural wood, namely hazel copse studded with 



Cr0mst0n '^Maitx. 165 

oaks, hollies, yews and birches, comes down to the very 
water-edge with here and there a bright green thwaite 
surrounded by dry stone walls heavy with the lichens of 
centuries. High on the brown moor above the line of cop- 
pice-wood, you descry the fields and houses of two ancient 
farms, the first called Lawson Park, the other Park-a-moor. 
In the survey of the ancient possessions of Furness Abbey, 
we find these two little high-lying holdings classed under the 
head of ^ Granges in Furness Fells,' the annual value of each 
being given at one pound ten. It is said that the fires 
in these old farm houses have not been extinguished for 
some hundreds of years, probably not since the farm-houses 
were erected. The peat, used as fuel, was easily kept 
alight, and the distance of the farmer from any neighbours 
and the non-existence of lucifer matches rendered it highly 
desirable that their hearths should never be cold. The ^tr 
3EslantJ forms a conspicuous object on this side of the lake. 
On the western side, as you look back over the hall and 
village, you observe how boldly the Old Man seems to detach 
himself from his neighbours and how he stands forth self- 
asserting and independent, only stretching out an arm, on 
the one side, to Wetherlam and, on the other, to Dow Crags, 
the latter of which presents a wild and rifted aspect ap- 
parent even at this distance, and both are seen more and 
more at large as your southerly course removes the 
vast bulk of the Old Man from the line of view. The 
Old Man subsides on the west into Gait's Hause — Gait's 
Hause rises into Dow Crags, — these again subside into 
Brown Pike — Brown Pike into Walna Scar — Walna Scar 
into White Maidens, the last completing the range in that 
direction, and abruptly sinking into Broughton Moor. On 
the same side you will have passed the old wood-covered deer- 
park extending from the lake-side a mile and more over the 



1 66 ©^onfeton ~yiZ£rater» 

summit of Bleathwaite. Below the park lies the farm of 
Hawthwaite. This farm, as we read in the old archives, 
was given to the Priory of Conishead by Roger of 
Brackenbergh. The place from which this old family 
(one member of which, I have heard, was Brackenbury, 
King Dick's lieutenant of the tower) derived their pat- 
ronymic, is now called Brackenbarrow and lies imme- 
diately behind Hawthwaite, or rather, between it and the 
bold heights of Torver Common, the steep gorse-clad side 
of which, coming sheer down to the water-edge, you pass 
ere you reach the point where ' the black beck of Torver,' 
flows into the lake. In the opening made by Torver beck in 
the heights, you will have noted the pretty farm-house of 
Sunny Bank, with the ancient Baptist chapel behind, and the 
bobbin mill before it, where Professor Holloway has his 
pill-boxes made. The rocky island, called the Gridiron, lies 
immediately off this point and, on the lower side of the 
beck, lies the old grey farm of Oxness, finely backed up by 
the verdant eminence called Stable Harvey. The scenery 
now becomes broken up into craggy, heathy knolls, rising 
into hills of the same kind, pre-eminent amongst which 
towers the beacon-hill of Blawith. Close to the lake-side 
stands the handsome Elizabethan villa called Brown How, 
commanding a splendid view of the lake, even up to the 
Waterhead, and the noble hill-country beyond. The eastern 
shore rises woody and wild, with little variety after Brant- 
w^ood is passed, until, rounding the timber-clad promontory, 
on which you see the fair residence of Waterpark, you come 
to the end of your outward voyage, with the village of 
Nibthwaite on your left, and that of Wateryeat on your 
right, while the quaint little church and new parsonage of 
Blawith and the rich valley of the Crake are directly in front. 
You wall probably find, or at least hear of, the floating 



©0nieit0n "^^tTatet. 167 

island hereabout. It changes its locality but no doubt it still 
exists. 

The lower part of Coniston Water is said to be tame. 
James Payn says, in his own facetious manner, that ^ like 
most of her sisters she is plain about the feet,' and indeed 
many of the most faithful admirers of the lake have ceased to 
dispute this, which is a generally acknowledged fact. There 
is now a very comfortable little inn on the Blawith side of 
the Waterfoot, where you may get every refreshment which 
a man can reasonably desire. It stands among scenery 
highly picturesque, consisting of successive but irregular and 
precipitous ranges of grey rock, — in some parts bare and in 
others clad with a heavy drapery of glittering ivy, — separated 
by intervals of purple heath, or green brackens and greener 
pasturage. 

The trip, down and up the lake, occupies about two hours. 
Although the Gondola is advertized to sail only twice a-day, 
arrangements may be made for special excursions at exceed- 
ingly moderate terms. 



CIRCUIT OF CONISTON WATER. 

(14 miles). 

The traveller must begin with the western side, as by so 

doing he will face the finest views on his return. A little 

more than a mile from Coniston he will notice the divergence 

on the left to Coniston Hall. The road turns from the lake 

^K till it reaches ^E^otbet, and then follows Torver Beck to the 

4 shore again. At the lower end of the lake, the river Crake 

6% is crossed by a bridge, at a village called Wateryeat. The 

traveller then takes the turn to the north and sees the whole 

length of the lake before him, enclosed at a distance of six 



1 68 ©Tircutt of 

miles by the rising grounds and woods of Mr. Marshall's 
estate, — the eminences themselves forming a lovely screen to 
the skirts of the mountains which tower behind. Wordsworth 
exhorted strangers to enter the district by this approach, as one 
of the very finest. He said, ' The stranger, from the moment 
he puts his foot upon Lancaster sands, seems to leave the tur- 
moil and traffic of the world behind him : and, crossing the 
majestic plain when the sea has retired, he beholds, rising 
apparently from its base, the cluster of mountains among 
which he is going to wander ; and towards whose recesses, 
by the vale of Coniston, he is gradually and peacefully led.' 
The road ascends and descends along the whole distance, — 
the hills becoming higher and steeper as the plain is left 
behind. The old village of ^Ei ibtfjbiatte is first passed, 
and the well-wooded grounds of '^J^S^'aterparfe, Then 
appear the islands, the ©rttJtron and ^ir ^EslantJ, near 
the eastern shore ; and next, ^tantinooli, where the artist 
did not need to look beyond his own grounds for wild 
flowers to suggest arabesques, and where views of exceed- 
ding splendour and beauty are commanded, in all lights, 
without passing the gate. It is the very home for artist or 
poet, with its craggy heights behind, its luxuriant woods 
around, and the vale of water below, enclosed with mountains 
of which the Old Man is the crown. A seat in these grounds 
is named after Wordsworth, from the fact of his recom- 
mending it as the best point of view for Coniston. Others 
prefer the view from above Coniston Bank, a mile further 
on. It is, however, best from a field, the last before reaching 
the new house on OTonfeton ^ank Some people think this 
the finest view in the whole district. And truly, the frequent 
visitor pronounces it more beautiful every time he comes ; 
and the passing tourist feels that, though only once seen, it 
can never be forgotten. Nowhere else, perhaps, is the 



^oniston "yZE'ater. 169 

grouping of the mountain peaks, and the indication of their 
recesses, so striking ; and as to the foreground, with its glit- 
tering waterfall, its green undulations, its diversified woods, 
its bright dwellings, and its clear lake, — it conveys the 
strongest impression of joyful charm, of fertility, prosperity, 
and comfort, — nestling in the bosom of the rarest beauty. 

A little further on, stands the house in which Elizabeth 
Smith lived and died ; and, on the opposite side of the road, 
a house, built on a spot where a tent was pitched, that 
she might draw her dying breath with greater ease, and enjoy, 
as long as possible, the incomparable landscape there stretched 
before her. The boat-house is at the bottom of the slope, 
down which she used to take her mother's guests ; and she and 
her sister were so well practised at the oar that they could show 
the beauties of the scene from any point of the lake. 

The road then descends and, sweeping round the head of 
the lake, passes the site of the former Waterhead Inn, now 
covered by a young plantation of Mr. Marshall's. 



TO LANGDALE, BY YEWDALE AND TILBERTHWAITE, 

AND BACK BY COLWITH. 

(17 miles). 

The excursion into Langdale by Blea Tarn, is one of the 
finest in the region, and can be taken from Coniston as well 
as from Ambleside or Grasmere, — the view of the slate- 
quarries in the Coniston route being fair compensation for 
the Skelwith valley in that from Ambleside or Windermere. 

The road is through Yewdale, and Tilberthwaite, and is 
reached by crossing the bridge near the church and then 
turning to the right. After two miles and a-half, the 
traveller sees another road parting off to the right, over a 



170 PBTrom ^oni^ion 

bridge. That is the Oxenfell road, by which he may return. 
The direction now is almost straight forward, passing by a 
farm-yard, into 5E^ilbert!)ixraite, — the dell which lies between 
Wetherlam and Oxenfell. A stream dashes among rocks 
below, while a road mounts the banks on either hand, pass- 
ing through a wild scene, partially softened by plantations. 
Vast heaps of blue stone show the extent to which slate^ 
quatrgmg goes on : and if the traveller cares to see for him- 
self what the works are like, he will not repent the enterprise. 
There are chasms by the road-side near here which excite a 
very uncommon sensation, when seen from the car or saddle : 
— vast depths, with archways, and blue ledges where the 
birds' nests show that the works are deserted. These quarries, 
now empty, were once wrought in the old-fashioned ways. 
It is worth while to see the modern appliances by which slate 
is obtained and sent forth to supply the increasing demand. 
Subteranean passages, vast domes, echoing recesses in the 
blue rock, drips of water, sprouts of vegetation, the din of 
men's mallets and cleavers, and the sight of their sinewy 
forms, as they work, some in sunshine, some in shade, and 
some in the yellow gleam of candles in the caverns, afford 
a spectacle worth a traveller's notice. 

The rough road descends at last, through plantations and 
over some boggy ground, to a stream which is one of the 
feeders of the Brathay. This stream being forded, the road 
ascends sharply for a short distance when the turn is 
to the left, climbing the hill-side above Langdale Tarn, 
and on to the high-lying valley which is the scene of the 
Solitary's residence in Wordsworth's * Excursion.' In that 
valley is ^lea W-^^^ with its one farm-house, — the deso- 
lation described in the poem being still there. The road now 
makes a steep and rough descent into J^itangtiale at Wall End. 
Few things in the region are finer than the head of Lang- 



t0 ^angMe, 171 

dale, as seen from this height. (See pages 86 and 87). The 
traveller can issue from it in various directions but must 
not forget to pay a visit to Dungeon Gill before leaving. 
If he is merely making an Excursion from Coniston, he 
will travel down the valley as far as Elterwater, where the 
turn is to the right towards Colwith Force, then on the other 
side of Holmefell to that which he skirted on his way forth, 
coming out into Yewdale. The whole circuit is about seven- 
teen miles. 



TO AMBLESIDE, BY HOLMEFELL AND SKELWITH 
BRIDGE, AND BACK BY SUNNY BROW. 
(18 Miles). 
This road has been greatly improved within the last few 
years. It is now quite equal to the old route, indeed in 
some respects it is even superior, the steep hill just after you 
leave Coniston being avoided, and the views being even 
more varied. The coach from Ambleside to Coniston 
generally goes by one road and returns by the other. On 
quitting Coniston, the road through "^eintJale already de- 
scribed, is followed as far as the farm ; the traveller then 
turns to the right and passes through what is known as the 
gorge ; having on his left Holmefell, and on his right Arn- 
side. Should he have time to clamber up to the two farm- 
houses which he will notice on the hill-side far above the road, 
he will get a fine view looking back through the gorge towards 
Coniston. At the top of the hill there is a rough country 
road crossing from Tilberthwaite towards Skelwith Bridge, 
to the left of the turn to Cclixritji Brftge, which may 
be seen in the valley below. The views in the descent are 
very fine. Besides the Wetherlam, which he will have be- 



172 J^rom ©onfeton 

hind him, he will see most of the mountains from Langdale 
Pikes to High Street, while just at the entrance of the Lang- 
dale valley is the pretty little lake of Elterwater, which 
perhaps is seen to greater advantage from this point than 
from any other. From Skelwith Bridge the road passes 
through Clappersgate to Ambleside. 

The return journey by the old Coniston road, is des- 
cribed at page 1 1 6. 

If the traveller does not wish to go as far as Amble- 
side, let him take the turn to the right just before crossing 
Skelwith Bridge. This will lead him under jEtonJK^elt into the 
old Coniston road by the ^uttng ^rabJ (p. 117) Should he 
return this way it would be worth his while to turn aside to 
see the view from .^©pg l^Hl, close to Skelwith Fold, (p. 77). 



TO GRASMERE. BY REDBANK, AND BACK BY 

AMBLESIDE. 

(23 Miles). 

The road to Ambleside (p. 171), should be followed as 
far as ^ftehnttfj fridge* After crossing the bridge it as- 
cends almost immediately by what is known in this country 
as a ^ foul step,' that is, a very rough and steep ascent : — and 
very rough and steep the traveller will find it, but it does 
not last long, as it soon joins the road coming from Amble- 
side. There are not many ' foul steps' left in the country. 
Formerly there were two on the road between Skelwith and 
Colwith Bridges, but thanks to modern improvements, they 
have both been done away with, much to the comfort of the 
traveller and the benefit of the horses. After joining the 
Ambleside road, ^ougi^rtgg 3?arn, over-shadowed by the 



t0 ©ragmere. 173 

very beautiful hill of the same name, is passed on the right 
(p. 77). At the guide-post the right-hand road should be 
taken, which conducts the traveller to the top of ^Eieti ^anfe, 
from whence he commences his descent into ©tasmere. Be- 
fore doing so, however, he must not omit seeing the view from 
High Close, a little off the road to the left-hand. At Gras- 
mere, the churchyard must be visited, and, if the tourist has 
time, a walk up to 3E.asetiale will well repay him. His road 
home may be along the eastern margins of Grasmere and 
Rydal lakes, through Ambleside and Clappersgate, then by 
Hawkshead or High Cross to Coniston. 

There is a way of varying the drive, by taking the lane 
under Iron Keld, mentioned at p. 172, the distance being a 
little less, perhaps. 



TO BOWNESS, BY HAWKSHEAD AND THE FERRY, 

AND BACK BY WRAY CASTLE, 

(20 Miles). 

If the traveller has been unable to see the view from 
^'onfeton ^attk, described at p. 168, he may do so in an 
excursion to Bowness, by ordering his car to meet him in an 
hour at the junction of the two lake roads, and walking for- 
ward round the head of the lake. To meet it, he follows 
the road, already described, past Tent Lodge, and arrives 
at Coniston Bank, after a walk of a mile from the inn. 

Retracing his steps for some way, and passing the turn 
which would lead him down to Tent Lodge, the stranger 
has rather a steep ascent before him, following which he 
finds at various points, looking back, new views of the lake 
appearing, while the magnitude of the Old Man becomes 
more apparent the farther he recedes from it. By the road- 



174 ^^rom ©Toniston 

post, which indicates the two ways to the two sides of the 
lake, he will find his car ; and he then proceeds through a wild 
country — moorland, sprinkled with grey rock, — in the 
direction of Hawkshead, which is three miles and a-half 
from Waterhead. 

The group of houses which is passed before descending a 
steep hill to Hawkshead goes by the name of ^Bi;ailikg]^£at< 
^jgtiU* One of these houses, hardly seen from the road, is 
the Baptist Chapel, believed to be one of the oldest dissent- 
ing places of worship in the kingdom. At the bottom of the 
hill the tourist passes an old farmhouse on the left. The mul- 
lioned window which now belongs to its barn formerly lighted 
an apartment where the Abbots of Furness held their courts ; 
and in this house a few of the monks from the Abbey lived, 
in order to perform spiritual rites for the people of this dis- 
trict. 

At this house the road takes a turn to the right ; and the 
traveller soon finds himself in ^B>;atofesIjeati, The parish 
church is ancient, and its appearance venerable, standing 
as a church should do, in full view of the country round, — 
that is of the valley in which Esthwaite Water lies. Elizabeth 
Smith lies buried here ; and there is a tablet to her memory 
in the churchyard. At the ancient Grammar School of 
Hawkshead, Wordsworth and his brother were educated. 
In the school library there are some interesting books, 
amongst others the family bible of Archbishop Sandys, the 
founder of the School. Passing through the quaint little town, 
the road turns to the left to reach the northern end of Es- 
thwaite Water, which is two miles long, and half a mile broad. 
This is a quiet sheet of water, with two promontories 
stretching into it, which look like islands, nearly dividing 
it into a chain of ponds (p. 42). 

Those who do not care to go over the lake to Bowness 



t0 ^olnness, 175 

can vary this route by taking the road which turns north- 
wards at the Ferry House, sometimes rising through woods 
and sometimes skirting the lake. These woods abound in 
splendid ferns, rare orchises, and rich and various wild- 
flowers. When the road turns down to the beach the whole 
scenery of the opposite side, and of the head of the lake, 
is spread out to view (see pages 37-40). At the distance 
of three miles, the road passes the gate of "ySS'rap ©Tastle 
and continues round Pullwyke Bay to Clappersgate and 
Ambleside. 

If travellers make this circuit (p. 44), signs of good work 
will meet their eyes. Two large proprietors in the neighbour- 
hood are t<raintn(J the land extensively, and thus preparing 
a healthy soil and atmosphere for a generation of residents 
yet to come. The unheal thiness of many settlements is no 
less a shame than a curse ; for the fault is in Man and not 
in Nature. Nature has fully done her part in providing rock 
for foundations, as well as the purest air, and ample supplies 
of running water. But the people live as the poor of the 
metropolis are too apt to be obliged to live — in bad smells 
and huddled together in cabins without any sufficient supply of 
water. This state of things shows a wilful neglect of oppor- 
tunities which is almost incredible. There are several 
causes for it, all of which admit of remedy. The great 
landed proprietors are, in two many cases, utterly careless 
about the way in which their humble neighbours live ; 
and those humble neighbours need enlightenment about 
sanitary matters. They are also too often at the mercy 
of the rich, who may interest themselves about the build- 
ing of handsome houses for opulent persons, but will 
never raise a cottage, or dispose of their lands for sites. 
The labouring class, therefore, suffer in health and morals 
as much as the poor in great towns. In places where the 



i7<^ ^rom CToniston 

fresh mountain winds are always passing hither and thither, 
and the purest streams are for ever heard gushing down from 
the heights, and the whole area is made up of slopes and 
natural channels, there are fever nests, equal to those found 
in the dampest levels of low-lying cities. The general 
absence of poverty makes the way to amendment open and 
clear. There can hardly be a safer or a more profitable in- 
vestment than C0ttage=butlbin2 in these districts, for a good 
dwelling is as easy to turn into money as a banknote. The 
railroads, which some have so much feared, will be no 
small blessing if they bring strangers from a more enlightened 
region to abolish the town-evils which harbour in the heart 
of the mountains. Meanwhile every systematic scheme of 
drainage is a promise of better things to come. 



TO BROUGHTON, BLACK COMBE, VALLEY OF THE 
DUDDON, ESKDALE, STANLEY GILL, AND WASTWATER. 
(23 Miles). . 

The road to be followed after leaving Coniston, passes 
through Torver, and diverges from the lake, overlooking 
a region in which the hills sink into heathery undulations, 
which again subside into a wild alluvion which stretches td 
the estuary. There is, as was before mentioned, a railway 
from Coniston to Broughton, but this description is given 
as it originally stood for the sake of what follows. The 
travellers must see the Duddon, and, in order to get to it, 
they and their carriage must go to Broughton. When it is 
high water, the scene is fine : but the vast reaches of sand 
at low water are dreary. The coast-railway is seen crossing 
the estuary, — its cobweb tracery showing well against the 
sand or the water. Near at hand Broughton Tower rises 



to ®utJbou "^alleg* 177 

from the woods above the little town : but there is nothing 
else to detain the eye. Tourists who desire to ascend ^lack 
<§r0mlje, should do it from hence, — the summit being only 
six miles from Broughton and guides easily procured. 
Wordsworth says of this mountain that *its base covers 
a much greater extent of ground than any other moun- 
tain in these parts; and, from its situation, the summit 
commands a more extensive view than any other point in 
Britain.* One would think that this testimony, and Col. 
Mudges' information that, when residing on Black Combe 
for surveying purposes, he more than once saw Ireland be- 
fore sunrise, would bring strangers to try their luck in seeing 
Scotland, Staffordshire, and Ireland from the same point. 
The mountain, however, lies out of the ordinary track of 
tourists, and very few visit it 

The next part of the drive is charming ; — up the \]^ alleg 
of the ^utibon. The series of sonnets that Wordsworth 
has given us may have led strangers to expect too much : 
but to the unprepossessed eye the valley must appear lovely. 
Leaving the Bootle road and the bridge to the left, the road 
ascends so steeply that the travellers will get out and walk ; 
and many a time will they turn to look at the sea-view, and the 
wooded slopes on the way to Bootle, and the rocks, dressed 
with wild flowers, that enclose the road. Then comes a 
common covered with fern, on which the greenest of paths 
form a net-work, while far below dashes the brown river be- 
tween rocky banks, Duddon Grove, with its conservatories 
and beautiful grounds and green clearings, being seen in 
the hollow of the vale. Four miles from Broughton, the 
bridge at *l^lp{|a]K.irfe spans the river, and discloses a beau- 
tiful view, up and down. The traveller must remark the 
strange holes (called J^ofs) worn by the water in the rocks, 
and the rounding of the edges of the boulders and shelves 

N 



17^ ;Krom ©onfetan 

in the channel. XsClpj^a ]B51irfe is a mere hamlet ; but there 
is a little inn at which the horses can rest if the party is 
disposed for a walk in order to see the scene of Robert 
Walker's life and labours. Ulpha Kirk itself is one of the 
primitive places where the old manners of the district may 
yet be traced more clearly than in most road-side settlements. 
The people still think it no sin to do their farm-work on 
Sundays, when the weather, — so precarious in that dis- 
trict, — is favourable ; and the familiar style of ' t' priest,' in 
these parts, makes the transition from work to worship very 
natural. Some time since there was a blind * priest ' settled 
here. One Sunday morning, service began before the people 
were all ready. Among them was the stoutest farmer in the 
neighbourhood, who, detained by some cow, pig, or sheep, 
entered the church last of all, * thunnerin' doon f aisle.' 
'Wha's comin, noo?' asked the blind priest. Being in- 
formed that it was John T , he enquired further, — ' a-foot 

or a-horseback ? ' Odd sprinklings of learning are found in 
these by-places, as they are in Scotland. Some students staying 
at this same little inn, and wanting to settle their account, 
wrote a note in Latin to the landlord, asking for the bill, and 
sent it by the girl who waited. Mr. Gunson immediately 
sent in the bill in Greek. It was too much for the students, 
who were obliged to ask to have it in English. There was also 
a ' heigh-larn'd ' woman, not far from hence, who married a 
farmer on the moor. When everybody was lamenting the 
hard times, she declared that, for her part, she would be 
contented if she could obtain food and raiment ; whereupon 
her husband rebuked her presumption. * Thoo fooel,' said 
he :. ' thoo dusn't think thoo's to hev mear then udder folk ! 
Tse content wi' mee-et and cleas.' 

3^eb}SeltJ ©fj^urcji is the place where Robert Walker, 
called * the wonderful/ exercised his office for sixty years.

The grey farmsteads stand under their sycamores, dis- 
persed in the vale, and up the slope which meets the 
Walna Scar track from Coniston. Rocky and wooded knolls 
diversify the dale; and the full beck runs down to join the 
Duddon, for which it is often mistaken. The Duddon, how- 
ever, is unseen here : so deep lies the channel among the 
rocks. The church is little loftier or larger than the houses 
near. If it were not for the bell, the traveller would hardly 
distinguish it as a church on approaching; but when 
he has reached it, he will see the porch, and the little grave- 
yard with a few tombs, and the spreading yew, encircled by 
a seat of stones and turf, pn which the early comers sit and 
rest till the bell calls them in. A little dial, on a whitened 
post in the middle of the enclosure, tells the time to the 
neighbours who have no clocks. Just outside the wall is 
a white cottage, so humble that the stranger thinks it 
cannot be the parsonage; though the cHmbing roses and 
glittering evergreens, and clear lattices, and pure uncracked 
walls make it look as if it might be. He walks slowly past the 
porch and sees some one who tells him that it is indeed 
]Eiotet "JiZSraHter'g dwelling, and who courteously invites 
him to see the scene of those life-long charities. Here it was 
that the distant parishioners were fed on Sundays with broth, 
for which the whole week's supply of meat was freely 
bestowed. Hither it was that in winter he sent the benumbed 
children, in companies, from the school in the church, to 
warm themselves at the single household fire, while he him- 
self sat by the altar during the whole of the school-hours, 
keeping warmth in him by the exercise of the spinning wheel. 
But the story is too well known, as it stands in Worc^worth's 
works, to need repitition here — too well known, we should 
think, to allow tourists to walk two miles from Ulpha Kirk and 
back again, without visiting the home, in life and death, of 

N2 



i8o 3Rr0m ©Tonfeton 

Robert Walker. There are changes even here. There is a 
school-house, warmer in winter than the church, but there is a 
decline in the number of attendants at church. The Wes- 
leyan chapel at Ulpha has drawn away some ; the tastes 
for Sunday diversion, which has found its way over the hills 
from Coniston has estranged more ; and the descendant and 
successor of the good pastor says that ' the old stock are 
gone and the new famiHes are different' Thus is the large 
world's experience reflected in this little vale ! 

;i^ eijjfieltJ is three miles from Ulpha Kirk, There is a 
small and very old-fashioned inn, where everything is clean 
and comfortable. This is a good place to sleep in, (if the 
traveller is fortunate enough to find the rooms unoccupied), 
when "^iZSTalna j^car is to be crossed. The finest part of 
the Duddon scenery is here, and there is a charming walk 
by the gtepping^^stones, celebrated by Wordsworth, and up 
and over the moor, to descend upon Eskdale. 

Our present object is, however, to ascend the moor by 
the carriage-road at Ulpha Kirk, and push on towards Esk- 
dale and Wastwater. As soon as the enclosures are passed, 
up springs the lark, and freely run the rills, and keen is the 
air ; while the mountains look like ghosts as they appear 
by degrees above the high foreground of the moor. It is 
a rare incident in the Lake District to meet with a latfe. 
Only on a wide expanse of moorland can it happen, 
for in the valleys the birds of prey allow no songsters. 
The eagles are gone (or nearly), and a few ravens are left 
among the crags ; but there are hawks hovering in every 
vale, so that those who would hear the lark must go out 
to such places as ^Birfeer ^iaox. The mountain-group 
in front is that which has been remarked upon before as the 
centre of the region. It is the lofty nucleus whence the vales 
diverge (as Wordsworth observes after Green) * like the 



to Esfetiale^ i8i 

spokes of a wheel.' Scawfell is the highest ; and the whole 
line, from that point to Hardknott, is very fine in all lights. 
The dark basin formed in the midst of the group must be 
observed, for it is there that Wastwater lies. 

At length a rude new road appears on the right, tending 
towards Birkerthwaite farm. It passes through the farm-yard, 
and, in another mile, a wooded ravine is seen. That ravine 
is jgtanleg ©ill, and at its head is the waterfall. The key 
of the grounds may be had at the farmhouse of Dalegarth. 

The ^tanleg ©ill Kail has much the character of 
Ara Force; but the immediate surroundings are un- 
rivalled by other waterfalls in the district. The glen 
itself is indisputably the finest in the region; and it is 
scarcely possible to say too much of the view from the moss- 
house on the steep, which should certainly be the first point 
of view. From hence the eye commands the whole ravine, 
whose sides are feathered with wood from base to ridge. 
The fall is between two crags, — the one bare, the other 
crowned with pines; and if there is a slant of sunlight 
between them, it gives the last finish of beauty to the chasm. 
The most modern element in the scene, is supplied by the 
larches, and these cannot offend the eye, — so well is 
their vivid green intermingled with the well-grown beech, 
oak, birch, and hollies of a sober hue. There is a bridge 
below, seen from the moss-house, which will tempt the 
stranger to find his way down ; and there he will meet 
with two more, by means of which he will reach the fall. 
Here, among a wilderness of ferns and wild flowers, he may 
sit in the cool damp abyss, watching the fall of waters into 
the clear rock-basin, till his ear is satisfied with their dash and 
flow, and his eye with the everlasting quiver of the ash sprays, 
and the swaying of the young birches, which hang over from 
the ledges of the precipice. He must then take a path which 



1 82 ^tcm ^mi^ton 

leads him under the rocks, now on this side of the stream, 
and now on that, till he emerges from the ravine, and finally 
winds his way through the hazel copse to the gate. 

It might be thought that our travellers would have no 
leisure for much meditating in the glen. There are, however, 
only six miles to be travelled, and no more rough mountain- 
tracks to-day, but a good road — wonderfully red ! — across 
Esfetiale and all the way to Strands. 

After crossing the Esk, the road turns sharply to the left, 
and runs above the river, till at the King of Prussia Inn, 
it turns out of Eskdale, and crosses into ^Elftettiale, Before 
Eskdale is lost sight of, the opening of the valley to the sea 
affords a fine view, with the little town of Ravenglass seated 
in the bay at which point the Irt, the Mite, and the Esk flow 
into the sea. Then comes a long ascent, with more views of 
the level towards the coast, — which is rich with wood and 
fields. Then there is a descent to cross the Mite ; and 
another ascent ; and a descent again to pretty Santon Bridge. 
Instead of passing the bridge the road to the right must 
be taken. There is another long ascent : but even a tired 
traveller will not complain of it, when in two miles, the circle 
of mountains round Wastwater opens before him. The 
lake is not visible; but there is no mistaking where it 
lies. To the right, and close at hand, the Screes present 
their remarkable sweep of deMs, their crests being streaked 
with red, grey, and vivid green, and here and there cloven for 
the passage of cataracts from the brow, which tumble down 
through the gloom of woods. Hawl Gill is the largest of 
these ravines. Next, the Scafell peaks rise above the rest, 
and Great End just peeps over the shoulder of Lingmell. 
The cleft between Lingmell and Great Gable is Sty Head 
Pass ; and to the left, from Great Gable are Yewbarrow and 
Middlefell. The broken foreground on the common whence 



k 



to IKfastlnater. 183 

this view is seen, adds greatly to its beauty. Descending 
upon Wastdale, the Irt is crossed ; and then the road meets 
others on the green at jgtranbg, when will be seen the two 
little inns. They are humble but clean; and horses can 
be had at them, and boats for the lake. 



CONISTON TO RUSLAND, BY HAWKSHEAD. 
(20 miles.) 
The drive to Rusland, though not strictly within the Lake 
District, is, on account of the charming variety of the 
scenery and the distant views which the mountains afford, 
one which the traveller will much enjoy. The road first 
passes through ^atoksi^eall (p. 174), and then continues for 
some little way by the western side of Esthwaite Water, 
(p. 41). About two miles from the town, Esthwaite Hall, now 
converted into a barn, is seen on the left. Jt was here that 
Archbishop Sandys, the great benefactor of Hawkshead, was 
bom. A little beyond this house, after passing through a 
gate, the road ascends a steep hill over Esthwaite Intake. 
When the traveller has reached the summit of this he should 
rest a moment and gaze on the scene before him, for he will 
scarcely find anywhere a grander panorama. Looking back, 
he sees at one glance nearly the whole range of moun- 
tain tops from High Street to Coniston Old Man, while be- 
neath him is the quiet but lovely vale of Esthwaite, reflect- 
ing in its calm waters the surrounding scenery. Before him, 
he will have the beautiful Dale Park, through which he will 
presently pass, while far away in the horizon, he will just get 
a peep of the sea at Morecambe Bay. It is true the view is 
not to be compared with many he has lately seen, want- 
ing, as it is, in grandeur, but yet it is a scene which will 



1 84 'Mxam ©"oniston 

be impressed on the memory. The road now rapidly 
descends into Dale Park, (a grand place in the spring for 
daffodils), past the pretty little ^uslanb church, and then 
turning to the right by the parsonage, conducts the tourist 
to Force Forge, one of the numerous bobbin-mills so con- 
stantly met with in this part of the country. Instead, however, 
of following the main-road past the Forge, he must turn to 
the left and enter a rough by-road which will lead him past 
Bark House Bank and Ickinthwaite, — the road taking a 
sharp turn to the right, almost round the latter farmhouse — 
to Bethecar Moor. The views from this moor are very 
fine — hill rising above hill in wild confusion, with an occa- 
sional glimpse of the sea between them. After crossing the 
moor there is a very steep descent to ^j£i fttfjlnaite where the 
road round Coniston Lake, (p. i68), which has already been 
described, is joined. The traveller is now six miles from 
Coniston, and has a good road home on either side of the 
lake. 



ASCENT OF CONISTON OLD MAN. 

(This mountain can be * done ' in two hours, but three, or even four 
hours, had better be reckoned on by ordinary walkers. ) 

This is an excursion which the active tourist will be sure to 
make. He will want to see the series of tarns ; and he 
hears it said, and very truly, that the prospects from the 
summit are finer than any but those from Scafell and Hel- 
vellyn, — if not, indeed, finer than the latter. There are 
various ways of accomplishing this feat. 

(i.) By taking a pony and riding by Dixon Ground, up the 
Slate Quarries' road, to within a quarter of a mile of the 
summit, which is reached by scrambling up the almost perpen- 
dicular side on foot. 



t0 i^z ©Itr XMlan. 185 

(2.) By keeping the^^!:^ aina ^car road, half-way across 
Banniside Moor, till the point where the southern and easiest 
slope of the mountain stretches the farthest down towards 
Torver, and then shaping a northerly course direct for the 
summit. When the traveller has left the bright and 
prosperous environs of Coniston behind him, and entered 
upon this moor, he begins to feel at once the exhilaration of 
the mountaineer. Behind him lies a wide extent of hilly 
country, subsiding into the low blue ridges of Lancashire. 
Below, turning round, he sees here and there a reach of 
the Lake of Coniston, — grey, if his walk be, as it should 
be, in the morning, and reflecting the dark promontories 
in a perfect mirror. Amid the grassy undulations of the 
moor, he sees here or there, a party of peat-cutters, with their 
white horse, the latter if the sun be out looking absolutely 
glittering, in contrast with the browness of the ground. It 
is truly a wild moor ; but there is something wilder to come. 
The Coniston mountain towers to the right, and the only 
traces of human existence that can be perceived are the 
tracks which wind along and up its slopes, the paths to 
the copper-mine, and a solitary house, looking very deso- 
late among the bare fields and fences. The precipice called 
Dow (or Dhu) Crag appears in front ere long ; and then the 
traveller must turn to the right, and get up the steep moun- 
tain-side as best he may. Where ^©oto ©*rajDf and the Old 
Man join, a dark and solemn tarn lies beneath the precipice, 
as he will see from the height above, in respect to which it 
lies due west. Round three sides of this @>ciaf0 ^am the 
rock is precipitous ; and on the other, the crags are piled in 
such grotesque fashion, as to afford,^ — like much of this side 
of the mountain, — a great harbourage for foxes, against 
which the population are for ever waging war. The summit 
is the edge of a line of rocks overhanging another tarn, — 



1 86 Ktom ©oniston 

Low Water, — which is 2,000 feet above the sea level, while 
the summit of the Old Man is 2,633 ^^s^t. 

(3.) By taking the same "J^^alna j©cat road till it 
approaches the Black Beck of Torver, then following its 
course to Gaits Water, and, taking the stony path along its 
eastern shore, climbing to the summit of Gait's Hause, which 
is the neck or pass connecting the Coniston Fells with Dow 
Crag; then to the right, backwards three-quarters wheel, 
and an easy march of half a mile across the smooth grassy 
slope called Fairfield, will bring the traveller to the object of 
his quest. By this route it is possible, with one or two 
short intervals of leading, to ride to the very top ; but it 
is a long road with many turnings. 

(4.) The pleasantest route, though perhaps neither the 
least laborious nor the shortest, is directly past the mines. 
Leaving the works, before inspected, a steep cart-road is 
taken, which winds up the hill between Paddy-end — a more 
elevated range of works so-called — and a high precipice 
called Kernal Crag. Across the face of the rocks over 
Paddy-end there is a diagonal fissure, called Simon nick, 
after the name of the miner who made it long ago. There 
were fairies in the land in Simon's time, and, directed by them, 
he found vast treasures of copper there. 

Still toiling upwards, the tourist attains the edge or lip of 
the basin which holds J^cbers "^iZSfater, one of the finest of 
our mountain lakelets, nearly circular in form, upwards of a 
mile in circumference, and all but surrounded by very steep 
grassy slopes and magnificent rocky precipices. The Mining 
Company have utilised the waters of this tarn by damming 
them up to a height considerably above their natural level, 
and so making it a reservoir for their works below. It is 
also observable that their excavations are made even at this 
height. Passing along a very uneven path on the hill-side 



t0 1i}z ©ItJ X3Elan, 187 

to the west of Levers Water, and arriving at a point 
about opposite to the approach to it, and nearly under a 
precipice called Oo Crag — that is Wool Crag — the 
steep ascent to the left must be taken, and a small water- 
course followed, until, still more to the left, a fine green 
Savannah, thickly dotted with sheep, comes into view. It is 
called the Ghyll-cove, because, from time immemorial, 
the sheep belonging to a farm called the Ghyll — or Gill — 
have been pastured in it. Cross this beautiful cove, and 
mount over the shoulder of Brimfell, which regularly gains 
upon the main eminence. Then the ascent becomes labori- 
ous, so much so, that the tourist will be fain, perhaps, to lie 
down upon the soft dry mountain grass to recover breath. 

Resuming his climb, he will come out by and bye, upon 
the high narrow ridge that connects the Old Man with the 
fells. It is now all plain sailing, until he arrives at the 
pillar, or pinnacle, or pile of stones, erected on the summit 
of the mountain, which, according to the best authority, 
is 2632 feet above the sea. At this point, a *Man' 
formerly stood ; but it was removed by the Ordnance Sur- 
veyors, who erected another, less convenient ; for the first 
contained a chamber, useful to shepherds and tourists 
overtaken by bad weather. 

Any erection of this sort, on a hill-top, is locally called ' a 
man,' and certain etymologists hold that this pile upon his 
summit gave the OM Man his title. Its name is obviously 
derived from the two common Celtic words AU and Mam — 
the first, signifying high, and the second a crag or rocky 
eminence, which perfectly describes the Old Man, and 
resembles very nearly the present pronunciation of his 
name as given by those who live in the district where he 
reigns. 

Meanwhile, looking abroad from the summit, the traveller 



1 88 ^aom ^0ntst0n in "yM'alna Scat 

sees (beginning from Goat's Tarn) D evoke Water, in a line 
with Goat's Tarn, to the west It is said that the trout in 
that lake used to have a great reputation ; and tradition de- 
clares that the comfortable abbots of Furness imported them 
from Italy. There is a fine stretch of sea visible, the Isle 
of Man being conspicuous in good weather. We need not 
recapitulate the names of the chief mountains ; enough that 
Ingleborough is visible in one direction and Lancaster 
Castle in another; and, in clear weather, even Snowdon 
may be seen. The number of tarns within view is re- 
markable. We have mentioned Goat's Tarn and Tow 
Water. Beyond the latter lies Seathwaite Tarn, whence 
the infant Duddon issues. Stickle Tarn is conspicuous, 
lying under Pavey Ark ; while in a hollow of the moun- 
tain, on its north-east side, are Levers Water and Low 
Water. Only the nearer lakes are seen; but there is a 
glorious stretch of sea, and when the estuaries are full, the 
coast is a beautiful spectacle. The shores of Coniston 
and Winandermere, studded with woods and dwellings, 
present nearer beauties. 

The finest descent, — though the longest, — is by the ridge 
of IkiZSret^erlam, above Levers Water, descending into 
Tilberthwaite and returning to Coniston through Yewdale, 
noticed at p. 157. 



OVER WALNA SCAR TO SEATHWAITE. 

(Seven miles of hill-work.) 

The traveller has already followed the track as far as the 

stream from Goat's Tarn (p. 185). After ascending for more 

than a mile he finds himself on a ridge to the south of Dow 

Crag» Descending he has a fine view of summits, from 



antj Jron ^eltr. 189 

Blackcombe to Scafell, and the valley of the Duddon opens 
beautifully beneath him. For the greater part of the way he 
has the stream upon his right. About half-way down there 
is a stile in the wall on the opposite side of this stream. By 
crossing it and following the track, which is plainly seen, the 
top of Dow Crag may be reached. It is about seven miles 
from Coniston to Seathwaite by Walna Scar. The active 
pedestrian might return to Coniston by way of Wrynose, 
Little Langdale, and Tilberthwaite (p. 143). 



ASCENT OF IRON KELD. 

There is one more hill excursion which we recommend the 
tourist to make during his stay at Coniston, and that is to 
an eminence, seldom visited, locally called iron ^E^ellJ, from 
which a glorious panorama of mountains is to be seen. The 
hill is on the eastern side of the Yewdale Valley, and 
extends nearly to Skelwith Bridge; but the principal 
point of view is only three miles from Coniston, and may 
be best approached by taking the road by Tarn Haws to 
two lovely houses called Arnside. As there is no regular track 
to the summit he will do well to enquire his way at one of 
the two houses. When he has reached the top, which is 
marked by a pile of stones, he will find himself well rewarded 
for the trouble of ascending this height by the extensive 
view which he will obtain. Surveying the circuit, the 
eye travels along by Blackcombe, at the mouth of the Dud- 
don, the Old Man of Coniston, Wetherlam, Wrynose Gap, 
Pike of Blisco, Crinkle Crags, Scafell, Bowfell, Great End, 
Langdale Pikes, Helm Crag, Skiddaw, (dimly seen through 
the Vale of St. John), Helvellyn, Seat Sandal, Fairfield, Nab 



190 ;Kr0m ©I'onigton 

Scar, Rydal Head, Scandale Fell, Kirkstone, (with the 
Traveller's Rest like a patch of snow upon the pass), the 
Kirkstone hills, and those about Kendal, round by Ingle- 
borough, Wrysdale Fell, Morecambe Bay, (divided by the 
fells near Greenodd and Ulverston), and so aw^ay to the Dud- 
don Sands, — a circuit truly of no mean magnificence in 
extent, and the fiUing up of which is quite equal to the 
framework. Coniston Lake is seen in all its extent, and 
one or two tarns on Borwick Moor ; the narrow part of 
Yewdaie, with Oxenfell on the west ; Little Langdale, with 
its mountains ; Great Langdale, with Elterwater, Loughrigg, 
with its solitary tarn ; Ambleside nestling at the foot of its 
mountains ; Winandermere, Blelham Tarn, Bowness, Latter- 
barrow, Hawkshead, with its rugged valley ; and Esthwaite 
stretching out with its peninsulas and glistening like a silver 
mirror. 

We have been somewhat minute with the description of 
Iron Keld, because we think that it has never received that 
attention from tourists which it deserves. By descending 
on the side opposite to that from which the ascent was made, 
the pedestrian will find his way home by the old road to 
Coniston.

^atterbale, being rather out of the ordinary track of 
travellers, is not so much frequented for a resting-place as 
Keswick and Ambleside, but it is a charming spot to spend 
a short time in, and we recommend the tourist, if he wishes 
to see Ullswater and its surroundings in perfection, to take 
up his abode at one or other of the two good hotels which 
he will find there. By doing so he will also have the 
opportunity of visiting Haweswater, which is one of the 
lovehest of the lesser lakes, and not nearly so well known 
as it deserves to be. 

The church, and the few houses round it, nestling under 
the hills at the head of Ullswater, are known as Pattettiale, 
a name, as some say, derived from St. Patrick, who, if 
accounts be true, once preached to the inhabitants of this 
vale. However that may be, the church, which is quite 
in keeping with the surrounding scenery and has been re- 
built, is called after the Saint, and this circumstance perhaps 

o 



194 "^IsCllsiwater* 

affords some ground for the truth of the tradition. It may 
be as well to observe here, as so many mistakes have been 
made on the subject, that the remains of the unfortunate 
Gough, who perished on Helvellyn, are not interred in this 
churchyard, but in the ground belonging to a Quaker's 
Meeting-house near the foot of the lake, he being a member 
of the society of Friends. There is, however, in the church- 
yard, a remarkably fine old yew tree which attracts the no- 
tice of all visitors. 



SURVEY OF THE LAKE. 

(The track of the steamer is about 15 miles, and the trip, out and home, 

occupies two hours and a-half. Coaches for Penrith meet the boat at 

Pooley Bridge landing.) 

There can be no question but that Ullswater should be 
approached from Pooley Bridge, as all its beauties are con- 
centrated at the head; but travellers who have not been 
fortunate enough to come by this route, should go by the 
steamer which makes the tour of the lake two or three times 
a-day, and which starts from the pier close to the Hotel. 

* Suppose, therefore, that we are starting from the head of 
the lake, the real grandeurs of which we are at present much 
too near to see : Glenridding Dod, and a few small moun- 
tains hem us in to westward; whereas, behind, and close 
by, tower the highest peaks that cleave the English skies, 
^lace iFell alone, sheer from the lake's breast, guards 
the eastern side till he gives place to his more sullen brother, 
Birk Fell ; then, Long Crag, and wood-fringed Hallen Fell, 
round which we glide into the little bay of ^feiobJtobin, upon 
whose sequestered shores is an hotel. On the right-hand 
gleams a milky waterfall. Scale Force (there are about six 
waterfalls in the district bearing this name) ; and, on the 



XsClliSbjater, 195 

left, frowns Raven Crag, (of which there nearly are as many 
as there are of John Streets in London). And now, as we 
steam out of the bay, turn your eyes southward, and if they 
be not fairly enchanted No : the blackness of dark- 
ness covers all : a bitter wind, the herald of the hail-storm, 
sweeps upon us : patter, patter, fall the huge frozen drops, 
and all the well-intentioned worshippers of Nature betake 
themselves to the cabin. There are but twelve of us, but 
we nearly fill that uncheerful apartment; and it is with 
something like terror that we read, upon a board that 
supplies the place of pictorial embellishment, that this boat 
is licensed to carry 200 passengers, except when cattle are 
part of the cargo, in which case three human beings are 
counted as one horned beast ! Presently, such is the fury 
of the tempest that the hatches have to be battened down, 
when the whole position becomes too ludicrous not to be 
enjoyable. After we don't know how long, for it is almost 
too dark to see the face of one's watch, one of the window- 
holders reports that things are looking better, and at the 
same time a bump informs us that we have reached our 
terminus. 

^ Green Dunmallet above us glitters with the storm-drops, 
as gladly as though they were 2.parure of diamonds bestowed 
upon her by her lover ; poor little Mell Fell has been taken 
in with equal facility : and bird and beck seem to vie with 
each other in mutual congratulations. Thus it is that the 
smiles of a tyrant are always welcomed. And now comes 
the promised glory. Before we reach Howtown again, the 
whole meshwork of the mighty hills, about the head of the 
lake, comes into view ; the long level height of Helvellyn ; 
the conical peak of Catstye Cam, immortalized as we poor 
mortals say) by Walter Scott ; the vast rounded summit of 
St. Sunday's Crag (so called may be because it is by no 

o 2 



196 "TiZifalfts at 

means a sight seen every day of the week) ; and many 
another grand old Fell, magnificent alone, but far more 
majestic when standing, as here, shoulder to shoulder, 
summit behind summit, as far as eye can reach. We can 
hardly withdraw our eyes, so rapt by these splendours, to 
gaze on dusky Swarthmoor, on the eastern margin of the 
lake, or even to Loadpot behind it, stretching up (at the 
back of Birk Fell) to unseen High Street, although we know 
that the great Roman Road ran, and still runs over both. 
Upon the western shore, however, we cannot fail to mark 
the fells that fringe it, each giving place to a larger one as 
we proceed : Glencoin, with its fine valley ; Gowbarrow, 
with its far-stretching park, dotted with herds of deer, 
and Lyulph's ivied Tower, and Ara flashing from its dark 
ravine; the swelling heights of Greenside, with fair Glen- 
ridding running up between, as if for shelter; and Sty- 
barrow's densely-wooded crag. As we glide to the pierhead 
yet another nest of hills, with Hartsop Dod standing finely 
in advance of them, comes into view, and all admit that we 
have hitherto seen no such spectacle from any lake as Ulls- 
water has presented to us. Winandermere is very home- 
like, and makes one wish to live for ever (or even die) in 
one of its many pleasant dwellings ; but, for grandeur, it is 
certainly not to be compared with its northern sister/ 



GOWBARROW PARK AND ARA FORCE. 

(8 miles). 

The tourist's first wish, after seeing the lake, will be to 

visit ,.^ra 3Sorce» This he may do either by land or water. 

As the lake has been described, we will suppose the 

former route is taken ; although it may be noted that nine- 



;]P>attertJal0. 197 

tenths of strangers go by boat. The distance is about 
four miles, the road winding by the shore, here shut in by 
dense woods, and at the next turn reveaHng, perhaps, a 
beautiful bay with charming overhanging trees which at 
once arrest the attention of the sketcher. At page 55, 
^oixrbarrobj ^ark and the waterfall are fully described. 

THE VALLEY OF GLENCOIN. 
(4 miles. ) 

We have already seen the dale from the lake. We must 
now conduct the tourist thither by land, and see how full it 
is of tempting subjects for the artist's pencil. About a 
mile beyond the Ullswater Hotel there is a lane on the left 
which leads into the @^lmC0 in valley. Shortly before reach- 
ing the lane, there is a gate into the wood ; by taking this 
path a corner will be cut off, and a very fine view of the 
lake seen. The dale is a retired, out-of-the-world sort of 
place, so much so that some of the houses in it go by the 
name of * seldom seen,' so completely are they hidden from 
the view of the passing stranger ; there is much, however, 
in the many beautiful pictures which it affords to repay an 
hour's ramble up it. At its head there is a path across the 
hills to the Glenridding valley, but we do not recommend 
this to the tourist unless he desires to pay a visit to the 
mines on his way home. 

GLENRIDDING AND THE SILVER MINES. 

(3 miles. ) 

The road to Glenridding is the one opposite the hotel. 

The chief inducement for visiting it is to see the lead-mines 

and the works connected with them. The stranger may be 

perhaps surprised to hear that 2,000 ounces of silver, besides 



198 "■'S^Sfalfeg at 

lead, are obtained from these mines every month. More- 
over, the silver is considered of such quality that it always 
fetches the highest price in the market. The chimney of 
the works may be seen higher up on the hill-side ; the flue to 
it is more than a mile in length, and whenever it is cleaned 
out, (a process which takes place once or twice a-year), a 
large amount of silver is extracted from the soot. It is 
strange to witness all this life and activity amongst the 
solitudes of the mountains ; and, doubtless, the smoke and 
turmoil of the glen form a striking contrast to that last 
visited ; yet the stranger will find much to interest him, and 
would be sorry to have missed seeing the operations which 
are carried on here. 

GRISEDALE. 
(6 miles. ) 
The way to Grisedale is by the road turning up close to 
the church ; the house passed on the right is Patterdale 
Hall, where the ' kings ' of Patterdale once lived. The 
head of the ancient family of Mounsey still enjoys the title. 
If the tourist does not visit this dale on his way to Gras- 
mere, he should not omit to walk up the valley as far as 
the foot of the pass, as the scenery is very fine and grand. 
Helvellyn towers above him on the right, while on the left 
are the bold and precipitous rocks of St. Sunday's Crag — 
an offshoot of Fairfield. 

BROTHERS' WATER AND HAYS WATER. 

(11 miles.) 

;Brot]^£r0* ""^Zt? ater is on the road to Kirkstone, and will 
be seen in the drive to Ambleside ; but the walk round the 
tarn is charming, and will form a pleasant excursion from 
Patterdale. 



)]p^attelial0. 199 

The visit to IBiagg 3^£Z"ater may be made at the same time 
if the tourist is not afraid of extending his walk so far. 
He must diverge to the left, to ^j^artsop, which he will 
notice just before coming to Brothers' Water. The track 
passes among the farms, and follows the beck between the 
mountains until its source is reached, — this source being 
itself the secluded tarn called Hays Water. This little lake 
is a mile and a-half from the main-road, and the ascent is 
rather steep. It is the delight of the angler because the 
delight of the trout. It is overhung by High Street ; so that 
perhaps the Roman eagles, as well as the native birds of the 
rocks, have cast their shadows upon its surface. Not far 
off lies Angle Tarn, on the southern end of Place Fell. 
Both these tarns send their brooks down to swell the stream 
from Brothers' Water, which is itself supplied from the busy, 
noisy beck that descends the Kirkstone Pass ; and the whole, 
joined by a tributary from Deepdale, form together the clear 
brown stream which winds through Patterdale and empties 
itself into Ullswater. Brothers' Water derives its name from 
the accident — which is said to have happened twice — of 
brothers being lost in it, in the attempt of one to save the 
other. (3n one of the two occasions, the accident hap- 
pened through the breaking of the ice, when the brothers 
were making a venturesome short cut across it to church. 

No persuasion of ours is necessary to induce the traveller 
to visit ® eeptrale, if he has time. Its aspect from the road 
is most tempting. 

PLACE FELL QUARRIES AND HOWTOWN. 
(12 miles.) 

The walk to Place Fell OLuartieg should not be omitted 
on account of the fine views obtained of the head of Ulls- 
water and the surrounding mountains ; and as it is within 



200 ®ri&eg from 

such easy distance, it may be accomplished by all. The 
way to it is to pass through a gate situated between the 
school and the rectory, cross the wooden bridge, and by a 
farm to the left, then scrambling up by a wall built of loose 
stones, a few steps to the left again, will bring the tourist to 
a ledge from which he will command one of the loveliest 
views he will as yet have seen : at his feet is the lake reflec- 
ting in its calm waters the beauties of the surrounding 
scenery ; opposite, he will look into the Glenridding valley, 
with its Greenside Smelting Works ; and to the left of this, 
if he carries his eye upward he will just catch the summit 
of Helvellyn. Turning to his left and following the wind- 
ings of the pretty stream flowing through the valley, and 
appropriately called Goldrill, he will discover Brothers' 
Water, and further up, Kirkstone Pass, guarded by the Red 
Screes on the right and Caudale Moor opposite. The 
stranger will doubtless long linger over the enchanting scene 
before him, and will take care to repeat his visit at sunset. 

The path which continues on past the quarries is the lake 
route to ^j^otntointt, a charming but rather rough walk of 
six miles out. The return journey might be by steamer. 



TO AMBLESIDE, BY KIRKSTONE. 
(lo miles.) 
The road to Ambleside passes the church and keeps along 
the left side of Patterdale until just before Brothers' Water 
is reached, when it crosses the stream to the right ; soon 
after this the ascent of Kirkstone begins ] the rock which 
marks the summit of the pass, and from which it takes its 
name, may be seen for some distance. The hill on the left 
is known as ©'autialc X3R<0flr, while that to the right is called 
lEietl j^cues* At the highest inhabited house, at the top of 6 



;]^attertjale, 201 

the pass, the traveller leaves the Troutbeck road to the left, 
and descends rapidly upon Ambleside. On the left is the 
valley of the Stock, whose waters are concealed by wood. 
Below, Winandermere opens more and more ; and at length 
the little town of J^mhlmitiz appears, nestling at the foot of 
Wansfell. The particulars of this route are given in the 
Windermere Section. 

If the traveller has to return to Patterdale, he may vary 
it by going as far as the Lowwood Hotel and then taking 
the first turn to his left, which will bring him into the Trout- 
beck valley, and then on to Kirkstone and so home. This 
would add three miles to the drive. 



TO WINDERMERE AND BOWNESS. 
(15 miles.) 
The route above described is to be followed as far as 
Kirkstone, when the Troutbeck road must be taken 3 it 
gradually descends into the valley, and just where the houses 
commence it crosses it to the church ; the hills which the 
traveller will notice opposite him in the descent, form part 
of the High Street range. From the church the road still 
descends until it joins the high- way from Ambleside at 
^flofe*0 Kouse ; here, the turn to the left takes the tourist 
to Windermere, while for Bowness, he must continue straight 
on (see pp. 33 and 36.) 



PATTERDALE TO KESWICK. 
(19 miles.) 

2 The road winds along the lake as far as Gowbarrow Park, 

3 from whence it ascends to I2)cicfera2, passing through Matter- 
6 dale and so on to JEroutfaeck stattou, where the railway can 



202 ^Excursion from 

be taken to Keswick. This route is described in reverse in 
the Keswick Section. In the season, there is a coach or 
omnibus once or twice a day from Ullswater Hotel to Trout- 
Station. 



TO PENRITH AND BROUGHAM. 
(33 miles, out and home. ) 

The road as far as Gowbarrow Park is the same as to 
Ara Force. From Gowbarrow Park to Pooley Bridge the 
road still winds delightfully along the lake, the hills decHning 
as the out-lying region is approached. Hallsteads, the family 
seat of the Marshalls, is the last stage commanding a moun- 
tain view. The hamlet of Watermillock is the chief settle- 
ment passed on the way to Water Foot. The Eamont is 
crossed by a handsome bridge leading to the pleasant inn at 
lE^ocleg ^tibrje, a great resort of anglers. A good lake-view 
is obtained from Ewesmere, near Pooley Bridge ; and the tra- 
veller may there bid his farewell to Martindale, Glenridding, 
and Hallin Fell. The hill of Dunmallet, or Dunmallard, is 
worth climbing for the vestiges of a Roman fort which are 
found at the top. As for the fisj^intj, there is abundance of 
trout, a few char, and plenty of skelly, the peculiarity of 
which may be best ascertained on the spot ; and in autumn 
quantities of eels are taken below the bridge. 

There are no objects of peculiar interest between Pooley 
Bridge and Penrith, but the roads which tend eastward are all 
tempting. One leads to Lowther Castle, and others enter the 
Park, leading to the villages of Clifton and Brougham Hall. 
Another, to the south-east, leads to Hawes Water and Mar- 
dale Green ; and the same road is pursued through Bramp- 
ton to Shap Abbey and the mysterious antiquity in the 
neighbourhood called Carl Lofts. Of the two last men- 



[j^atterlJale, 203 

tioned little now remains — one tower being almost the only- 
remnant of the once magnificent Shap Abbey, and the 
farmers having made so free with the granite blocks which 
once marked the area of ^arl J^ofts,its boundary is difficult 
to trace. It was once a strip of land half-a-mile long by 
about twenty-five yards broad, covered by huge granite 
blocks placed at intervals of ten or twelve yards. To the 
west of Pooley Bridge, the main-road leads to Keswick. 

^enritSi is a neat litde town, busy from the fact of its 
being a great thoroughfare of the district, but not particu- 
larly interesting, except for some Druidical remains in the 
neighbourhood, a curiosity in the churchyard, and Brougham 
Castle. The circle called Long Meg and her daughters is six 
miles from Penrith ; and no relic of the kind in England is 
better worth a visit. In the churchyard of Penrith is the monu- 
ment about which nobody really knows anything, though 
it goes by the name of the Giant's Grave. It consists of 
two stone pillars, with four slabs between them, set up on 
edge. There are some unintelligible carvings on the upper 
part of the pillars. This was the monument which Sir 
Walter Scott's family could not get him past, (though they 
had all seen it ' dozens of times '), when, failing and infirm, 
he set out on his last sad journey in pursuit of health. Pass- 
ing through Penrith, he would see the Giant's Grave ; and 
thither he limped, to wonder once more what it could mean. 

The parish of Brougham, Burg-ham (meaning Castle-town) 
was the Bovacum of the Romans, where, as we learn from 
Nicholson and Burn, they had a company of Defensores, 
and left many tokens of their presence in antiquities which 
have come to light from time to time. The village of 
Brougham passed into the hands of the Veteripoints in the 
reign of John or Henry III. The Castle of Brougham has 
been held by the Veteripoints, Cliffords, and Tuftons, and is 



204 Excursion from 

at present the property of the Earl of Thanet. It is now in 
ruins, and fine ruins they are. They stand at the confluence 
of the Eamont and Lowther rivers, at a distance of a mile 
from Penrith. 

Brougham Hall, the seat of Lord Brougham, is within a 
mile and a-half of Penrith. The traveller should walk 
along the river bank from the bridge at Brougham Hall to 
Askham, and then ascend the steep bank of red sandstone, 
overshadowed by trees, to the park of Lowther Castle. 



HAWES WATER AND LOWTHER CASTLE. 
(19 miles to Mardale ; back, by Lowther, 20 miles more.) 

The traveller should by no means miss seeing Hawes 
Water, for though less visited than any other lake in the 
district — being rather out of the way — it is very beautiful. 
It may be approached either by road through Pooley Bridge, 
Askham, or Bampton ; or by foot from Howtown, across the 
hills. This latter route we shall describe when we point out 
the mountain excursions in the neighbourhood of Patterdale. 
For the carriage-road, that mentioned at p. 202 should be 
taken to Pooley Bridge, whence the tourist must diverge to 
the right in a south-easterly direction : or rather, let him take 
the road for Askham, which, though somewhat longer, is far 
more beautiful. On reaching Hampton, those who want to 
shorten their excursion and have a near view of Hawes 
Water, should go southward to ^Eiossgill ^BJill ; from no 
point on the shore of this lake is the view so fine. 

We pass through Bampton, and soon after Thornthwaite 
Hall, *a dark-blue piece of Haweswater, lying between 
funereal Naddle and Burnfell, with its milky white waterfall 
called ^]Eleasanb ^orcc, comes into view. Bid the coach- 



^atterbak* 205 

man stop, for the scene is indeed a sublime one, and well worth 
running the risk of being carried away by a * helm wind ' 
in viewing it. It is undoubtedly the finest * station ' — as 
the old guide-books have it — for seeing Haweswater, and 
even includes a peep at distant Saddleback. Moreover, 
across the ink-black forms of Kidsty Pike and High Street, 
in the extreme distance, marches the mountain storm to- 
wards us, — a living wall of water. Before it, all is sun- 
shine ; you perceive the gleaming fields devoured, one after 
another, by the serried ranks of rain. Nearer and nearer 
comes the noiseless host, until against the glasses of the 
carriage the drops begin to patter, — skirmishers of the 
great Array ; then, in a few moments, all is in darkness : 
the earth itself has disappeared : a second deluge drowns 
both Land and Sky; then, thinner and thinner grows the 
rain-curtain, and the unceasing volley gives place to a dropp- 
ing fire : the rear-guard of the storm is passing by. Above 
it strides the rainbow, — an arch of triumph for the conquer- 
ing sun, who now once more reassumes his usurped throne, 
and all the landscape decks itself in smiles to welcome his 
return. Proud High Street doffs its crown, and does him 
fealty; the tribute of a thousand silver streams is paid to 
him in a single instant ] the dark fells dance with brightness ; 
and the erst frowning lake shines like a spoilt brunette, re- 
conciled, for the nonce, to her lover. 

' It is no wonder that, living in a locality where the 
glorious change from storm to sunshine is so common, that 
Wordsworth should have described it with such eminent 
success. Other poets, though possessing even a greater 
command of fitting epithets, often give the impression of 
having imagined such scenes ; but it is impossible to doubt 
that Wordsworth was an eye-witness of them. What a 
truthful picture is contained in those few opening lines of 



2o6 Excursion from 

his * Resolution and Independence ! ' They are applied to 
a fine day, but it is equally true of a fine hour in Lakeland. 

" There was a roaring in the wind all night C 
The rain came heavily, and fell in floods ; 

But now the sun is rising, calm and bright ; 
The birds are singing in the distant woods ; 
Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods ; 

The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters ; 

And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. 

All things that love the sun are out of doors ; 

The sky rejoices in the Morning's birth ; 
The grass is bright with rain-drops ; — on the moors 

The hare is running races, in her mirth ; 

And, with her feet, she from the plashy earth, 
Raises a mist, which, glittering in the sun, 
Euns with her all the way, wherever she doth run. " 

Who that knows the country, and especially the Lake 
Country, will not bear witness to the fidelity of this descrip- 
tion ? Its truth struck me more than ever as we rapidly 
passed through the fresh, sweet smelling air, and amid the 
songs of innumerable streams.' 

The travellers who wish thoroughly to explore the Valley 
of ^ainesinater and X^Clarliak, will find it fully described 
at page 68, and there also the exits to Longsleddale, Kent- 
mere and Troutbeck are detailed. 

On the return journey, after Bampton, as we have to pass 
through ,^0ft]^am, only half a mile from ^ob3tIjer Castle, 
it seems a pity not to visit that splendid palace. The mansion 
itself, huge enough for Royalty, with a court-yard large 
enough for the review of an army, will repay a visit to all 
lovers of painting and sculpture. All the year round it is 
open to strangers six days a week, even though the family be 
residing there ; and the hospitable lord is said to submit 
to be driven from room to room, rather than debar the sight- 



^attertrale, 207 

seer from taking his eyefull. Howpver, the finest part about 
the Castle is, beyond question, the terrace, a grass-green 
walk of 400 feet long and 90 broad, from whence there is a 
wondrous view of vale and mountain. The most remarkable 
feature of this landscape is perhaps the hollow in which 
Haweswater lies. The park has some fine old trees ; and 
the number and size of the yews in the grounds will strike 
the stranger. But lasting injury was done to the woods by 
the hurricane of 1839, which broke its way straight through 
them, levelling every thing in its path. 

On the road from Bampton to iVskham, the high grounds 
of Lowther present, on the right, a nearly straight line of 
elevation, along which runs the park-wall, almost to the ex- 
tremity of the promontory. 

From a distance, it looks the most enviable position for a 
park that can be imagined. 



GRISEDALE PASS. 
(10 miles of mountain- work. ) 
There is a very charming walk of ten miles from Patter- 
dale to Grasmere (from inn to inn) by Grisedale, which may 
as well be enjoyed by the pedestrian traveller, whether he 
chooses to ascend Helvellyn or not. Grasmere and Grise- 
dale have the same derivation, — Gris being the old Saxon 
word for * wild swine : ' and these are therefore, * the lake ' 
and * the valley' * of the wild boar.' A deep and still retreat 
must either of them have been in the days of wild boars. 
The Grisedale valley will be visited with interest by geologists. 
Sir R. Murchison reports that it bears more distinct traces 
of glacial action than any other in the district. At the lower 
end remains of moraines are clearly traceable, and at several 



2c8 Eicursfon from 

points there are stones which, from their being of a different 
formation from the surrounding rocks, give evidence of 
having been brought from a distance. 

From Patterdale the traveller crosses Grisedale beck, and 
ascends by a well-wooded road to the table-land of Grise- 
dale. The old hollies in the woods here are remarkably 
fine. At every step the grandeur and gloom overhead in- 
crease, — the path leading directly under the frowning Hel- 
vellyn. There are lead-mines about half-way up, under 
Striding Edge ; and the tourist is likely to mistake the track 
to the mines for his own road : but he must keep the stream 
to the right, — in other words, he must keep on the right 
bank of the stream for some way further. The path crosses 
and re-crosses the beck in climbing the steep ascent to the 
tarn ; but there is no further danger of losing the track. 
The view of Place Fell behind is fine, as seen through the 
steep sides of the dale ; and, north-westwards, the mountains 
above the Vale of Newlands are seen peeping between Seat 
Sandal and Helvellyn. The tarn lies under the east flank 
of Seat Sandal, in a deep hollow ; and a more sweet and 
solemn resting-place than ©tfoetiale JE^am is perhaps not to 
be found among the mountains. A wall runs along the 
ridge ; and through a gate in that wall the track leads down 
to Grasmere. The views are gayer and more extensive by 
far than those presented on the other side of the pass. The 
mountains now seen are the Langdale Pikes and Coniston 
Old Man, with Scawfell and Bowfell predominant. The 
first part of the descent is steep, and the latter part gradual 
and pleasant, over grass, and finally between fences and 
among farmhouses, till the path comes out upon the mail- 
road, opposite Helm Crag, and some way above the Swan 
at Grasmere. About half-a-mile before he reaches the high- 
road, the traveller must look out for ^m^z ©ill Jtotce* 



^attertale, 209 

the path is high above the stream the fall may be missed. 
It is not one of the finest falls, but is well worth seeing, and 
is easily reached by descending the bank to the stream. 



ASCENT OF HELVELLYN. 
(5 miles of mountain-work to the summit. ) 
If the traveller ascends Helvellyn via the Grisedale valley, 
he must take the road to the right, soon after entering the 
dale, in order to reach Red Tarn. Some sturdy climbers 
go on to Grisedale Tarn, and ascend from thence : but it 
is better to take the road to ^et( ^^arn. The path is clearly 
marked, and it is possible to go on ponies to within half- 
an-hour's walk of the summit. When the tarn is reached, 
the climber has the summit almost immediately above him to 
westward ; ^tritJing S^5^ to the south ; and a similar ridge 
called jgjtoirrel E%^ to the north. This last is the ridge 
along the breast of which lies our track, the conical head of 
Catstye Cam being its termination; and this part of the ascent 
is that which is most trying to unaccustomed nerves, though 
there is no real danger. It was in trying the other ridge, (al- 
ways a foolhardy attempt), that Charles Gough fell from the 
precipice into the valley, where his corpse was watched by his 
dog for two months, until it was found. Every one knows the 
story, as told by Wordsworth and Scott. There are stakes 
near the tarn where horses are fastened, and then there is a 
steep scramble by zig-zags to the top. (See page 13?.) 



ASCENT OF HIGH STREET. 
(Six miles to the summit.) 
For the ascent of High Street the road towards Winder- 
3 mere should be followed until ^artsop is reached ] then by 

p 



2IO Excursion torn 

the beck to IKags "^iSfater, as at p. 199. From the north 
end of this tarn the traveller will find a zig-zag path in an 
easterly direction. This will lead him to the ridge and 
the [Eioman ^EloatJ, The road is grown over with grass, 
like the other parts of the ridge, but is clearly defined. 
After following it in a southerly direction for about half a 
mile, the traveller catches sight of Winandermere, and then 
if he turns eastwards, a few paces will bring him to the 
precipice beneath which lies Blea Water. 

The ascent from Hays Water may also be made by follow- 
ing the stream which feeds the tarn. 

The distant views by this route are finer than by the 
ascents from Mardale Green or Troutbeck. Helvellyn is the 
most interesting object of view, more of it being seen from 
this height than from any other. Its great arms S./irrel and 
Striding Edge lie stretched out as if on a map. The * men ' 
on its summits are also seen, and the hollows which con- 
tain its tarns. Most of the mountains of the district 
are nigged and precipitous on the eastern, and rounded and 
grassy on the western side. This is remarkably the case 
with Helvellyn, and, as its relative position to the high 
summits causes its being seen most frequently from the 
western side, its full grandeur is not apparent till the traveller 
has obtained the view of it from Kidsty Pike or the ridge 
of High Street. (See page 60.) 

The descent may be made either to Mardale Green (de- 
scribed in the Windermere Section) or to Troutbeck ; for 
the latter route keep on the table-land until the Troutbeck 
valley is well in view, when the track leading up from it can 
be distinctly made out; follow this until the farm at the 
foot of the tongue is reached. From this point the road 
may be taken either to Windermere, or back again to Pat- 
terdale over Kirkstone. 



^attertiale. 211 



TO HOWTOWN AND BACK. 

(12 miles.) 

There is another route to Howtown besides that men- 
tioned at page 20c, — over Place Fell and through ^orctiale. 
The pedestrian must climb the hill-side at the farm near 
Place Fell Quarries. The path is visible. When the top 
of the Pass is reached, on looking back, he will have a fine 
view of the Head of Ullswater and its surroundings. There 
is no difficulty about the road through the valley, and 3fe^obJ= 
toixin will be reached after six miles of average hill work. 

There is choice of ways home, namely by steamer or by 
the path along the shore. 



TO HAWESWATER AND BACK. 
(4 miles of road and 1 6 of mountain.) 

Travellers have often wished to reach Haweswater on foot 
without going round by Pooley Bridge. We will now attempt 
to show how this can be done. On starting, the traveller must 
take the path at Place Fell Quarries for Boredale, as in the last 
excursion ; but, when the summit of the pass is reached, in- 
stead of turning to the left towards Boredale, he must keep 
straight on, making for an old gate-post which has evidently 
been set up as a land-mark ; passing this, he will see a good 
track leading over the brow of the hill into X^artmtJale* 
At the foot of the hill is the Dalehead farm, after passing 
through which he must strike across the fields to a wood on 
the opposite side of the valley, diverging a little to the left 
to cross the bridge. A gate will now be seen on the right, 
leading into the wood or copse. Ascend diagonally through 

P 2 



212 JEjctntmn from 

this wood to a wicket-gate in the wall which may have been 
noticed from below. The ascent must still be continued, 
keeping on the right-hand side of the wall until the summit 
is gained. There is one wall to climb. When on the sum- 
mit, which is flat and rather boggy, keep in a south-easterly 
direction until the X^^asantljecft valley is seen. As there is 
no track here the traveller must make his own, gradually 
descending the hill-side, until he gets sight of a small 
wooden bridge across the beck ; this must be crossed, 
and then a path will be seen leading past more culitvated 
land towards a ruined farmhouse on the left; near this, 
and close to a very fine holly tree which is worth while 
inspecting, is a gate, and from this point he will have no 
further difficulty, as he will strike the road a few yards 
further on, and just opposite the junction of Low Water 
with ;]6iabJ00inater, When our traveller has reached this, let 
him turn to the right, and in about half-an-hour he will be 
at X3^artiale ©retn. The view of Haweswater, above the 
ruined farmhouse which we have just mentioned, is certainly 
one of the most exquisite we know ; the lake looks so calm 
and placid, and the mountains rise round it so grandly, that 
we seem to be gazing on a scene scarcely of this earth. 
AVhat adds, perhaps, to this feeling is that the hand of man is 
less discernible about this lake than about many of the others. 

The time taken in this expedition will be nearly four hours ; 
but this may be considerably shortened by going in the steamer 
to Howtown landing, whence a track, gradually ascending 
the valley, can be made out to the summit as above. 

Haweswater may be reached by crossing High Street, as at 
p. 209 ; but, the great disadvantage of this route is that the 
lake is first seen from a height whence its beauties are much 
diminished, and an unfavourable impression created of what 
is really one of the most lovely lakes of the district. 



^attertiale* . 213 

In returning, the traveller can, if he likes, ascend High 
Street and descend by Hays Water and so home by the 
Kirkstone road. In doing this from Mardale Green, care must 
be taken to make a sufficiently wide circuit of Blea Water. 
Its rocky boundaries are very steep, and more than one un- 
fortunate tourist has been * crag fast,' and rescued with diffi- 
culty, in consequence of having attempted to descend too 
near the tarn. Observing this caution, however, the traveller 
may ascend either by the northern or southern ridge; the for- 
mer is generally recommended by dwellers in the dale. The 
top of High Street is immediately above Blea Water, p. 210. 

The descent has been described in the Windermere Sec- 
tion, as also the view from the summit

Keswick, until within the last few years, was much more 
isolated than Bowness and Windermere, but now the route 
offered by the Cockermouth, Keswick, and Penrith Railway, 
which was opened in the autumn of 1864, supplies direct 
communication with the main lines north and south. 

In approaching Keswick from Penrith, the rocky vale of 
Greta is seen to great advantage, as the new line follows the 
sinuous course of that stream, piercing through the red 
rock, and emerging from the * darkness visible' of the 
railway tunnel upon patches of the greenest meadow, by 
the side of which the Greta brawls musically at the foot of 
overhanging woods. After skirting Keswick on the north, 
(where it runs urder Latrigg and the lofty Skiddaw), the line 
makes a circular sweep behind Crosthwaite Church, and 
crosses the valley of Braithwaite at the foot of Grisedale 
Pike; there it follows the line of the old coach-road to 
Cockermouth, skirting the shore of Bassenthwaite, under 



220 ^Keslntclt district. 

the imposing masses of Barf and Whinlatter Fell. The 
views on this portion of the line are of great beauty. 

JK£0i»icfe is supposed by some authorities to derive its 
name from Kesh^ the local name for a kind of hemlock that 
abounds in its neighbourhood, and wick^ a village. There is 
no beauty in the primitive little town itself; but outside there 
are new terraces and groups of pretty lodging-houses ; also 
the gigantic new railway-hotel, which stands out boldly as 
one approaches the valley. And, it has other attractions be- 
sides the convenience of its situation among so many moun- 
tains and valleys. One of these is the Model of the Lake 
District, which may be seen during a shower, when, other- 
wise, the stranger might be losing temper in hearing the 
rain drip. He will probably linger over it till he has learned 
all the sixteen large lakes, and some of the fifty-two small 
ones, and traced every road and main pass in the district. 
^ Secondly, on a wet ,dayan ^.Keswick, , there ^i^, th^.,JP,encil 
Manufactory to be explored^ — one of the few commercial 
visits that can be paid without one's being stunned by engines, 
having one's teeth set on edge by saws, or being nauseated 
by oil. It is an industry peculiarly befitting the scene of its 
labours. In an atmosphere redolent of Cedar of Lebanon, 
you behold the pencils made with which artists reproduce 
the beauties around us, to gladden our eyes when we 
are far away. All lead used at Keswick is not Borrowdale 
lead ; but such is always to be procured, — if you choose to 
pay for it There were times when the simple dalesmen 
only used the ^ wad ' for marking their sheep with ; but even 
a hundred years ago the price of the best lead was thirty-five 
shillings a-pound. In the preamble to the act of Parliament 
passed to protect it in 1752, it is described as 'necessary to 
the casting of bomb-shells and cannon-balls ; ' but its chief 
use now is for making pencils. In the edition of 181 6 of 



^0Sb)trft. 221 

the Mag}ia Britannia^ it is stated, * the wadd, or black lead, 
is not found in regular veins, but lying in lumps or nodules, 
in the fissures of the slate-rock, the lumps varying from an 
ounce to fifty pounds. When the mine is opened,'^ a suffi- 
cient quantity is procured to answer the demand for several 
years : the black lead of the best quality is packed in barrels 
and sent to London by the waggons, — the proprietor of 
which is bound in a considerable sum for its safe delivery. 
It is deposited in the cellars under the Unitarian Chapel in 
Essex Street : and, on the first Monday in every month, there 
is a sale of it, which the pencil-makers attend in an upper 
room in a public-house in the neighbourhood.' But whether 
we purchase artist's pencils or not, at Keswick, by all means 
let us purchase pencils, which, in a few minutes, the expert 
workmen will deliver to you, with any name you please cut 
in them in gold or colours. Nothing delights small folks at 
home more than such gifts as these ; to see their own names 
— and better still, their nicknames — engraved on their own 
property, after this fashion, seems little less than magic, and, 
if dear papa or mamma present them, the magic of love. 

Thirdly, on a wet day in Keswick, there is the visiting 
©reta Kail, once the residence of Robert ^outljeg. In 
that little house yonder, (for it is small for a Hall), which you 
behold from the bridge, he wrote more than a hundred volumes 
and a hundred and fifty articles — some of them, like that 
on Nelson, as big as a book — for different Reviews ! Thirty- 
four years ago, he escaped from the thrall, and is laid in 
Crosthwaite Church, close by the scene of his studies and 
labours of love. A visit to the church, and the monument 
which it contains to his memory would be a fitting close to 
this short walk. 

* The mine is shut at the present date, and has been so for years. 



22 2 ^egioicfe district 

The town has also its town-hall, market^house, banks, 
mechanics' institute, library which visitors are allowed to use, 
a second church, a well-endowed grammar school, and, gene- 
rally in summer, there are (third-class) players at the theatre. 

There are excellent guides in all parts of the district, but 
none better than at Keswick. 



CASTLE HEAD. 
(An hour's walk.) 

The first piece of advice given to strangers is to go to 
Castle Head, or, as it is locally called, Castlet. Castle 
Head is a wooded hill rising to the left of the road from 
Keswick to Borrowdale, and about a third of a mile from the 
town. One footpath surrounds the hill, leading to a quarry 
of fine stone, used in the buildings in the neighbourhood : 
but the other path is the interesting one, winding up and 
through the wood to the summit of the rock, from whence 
the best view of the surrounding mountains may be obtained 
by persons who cannot undertake more arduous ascents. 
Far away to the right, or northwards, stretches Bassenthwaite 
Lake, and, nearer, the populous and rich plain which fills 
up the space between the two lakes. Immediately below 
lie the church and parsonage of St. John, and the grey town. 
In front lies ^etiMentinater, sprinkled with islands, and 
showing in clear and still reflection the wooded heights which 
guard it to the west. The southern view is the special glory 
of this station. Beginning at the left hand, the nearest 
height is Walla (or Wallow) Crag, with its fellow. Falcon 
Crag, immediately beyond it. These crags, wooded to their 
very crests, are beautiful in all seasons, and especially in 
autumn, when all woods less sheltered show only a wintry 



"J^tfalfegi, 223 

bareness. Passing over some lower ridges, Glaramara, which 
forms * the fork ' and is * the tongue ' of Borrowdale is seen 
swelling above the intervening heights. Next comes the cen- 
tral peak of Scafell and Great End, filling up the space be- 
tween the sweep of Glaramara and Gate Crag : and con- 
spicuous in the fore-rank, is Castle Crag, a bold conical 
height at the entrance to Borrowdale. Next, behind the 
front ridge of Catbells, the Buttermere mountains show 
themselves ; Great Robinson, High Stile, Red Pike, the 
Knotts, and Rowling End : and towering opposite Causey 
Pike. The best time for enjoying this walk is early morn- 
ing, — for those who do not object to dewy paths. It is a 
favourite place for pic-nics which are sometimes got up on a 
large scale ; and it is the resort of all strangers. 



CROW PAEK, COCKSHOT, AND FRIAR'S CRAG. 
(2 miles.) 

Crow Park is the spot best known to fire-side travellers by 
the repeated mention of it in Gray's Letters. It lies be- 
tween the town and the northern end of the lake, and is 
therefore close at hand, to be enjoyed in any odd half-hour. 
Gray went there the last thing at night, and the first in the 
morning. He saw * the solemn colouring of night draw on, 
the last gleam of sunshine fading away on the hill tops, the 
deep serene of the waters, and the long shadow of the 
mountains thrown across them, till they nearly touched the 
hithermost shore. At a distance were heard the murmurs 
of many waterfalls, not audible in the day-time.' At that 
time, 1769, there were large roots remaining of the old oaks 
that once formed a glade here, — a noble approach to the 



2 24 JE5Lt2b3ick ;E)fetrfct 

lake : but the place was in Gray s eyes, ' a rough pasture ' 
while affording the best point of view for the sketch of the 
lake. With regard to the near objects of the landscape, Gray 
preferred the gentle eminence of Crow Park to Cockshot, 
as he preferred Cockshot to Castle Head. After Gray's 
time, Crow Park was used as a race-course, and was the 
scene of Cumberland games, and the starting-point of the 
boats at the annual regatta. The steward of the Derwent- 
water estates built his pretty residence there, a few years ago 
and the wildness of the spot has disappeared* The first 
green eminence on the right, as the lake-road leaves Kes- 
wick, is Crow Park. 

Gray saw Cockshot * covered with young trees, both sown 
and planted,- and all thriving wonderfully. These young 
trees are now large oaks and spreading beeches. The 
stranger cannot miss the stile, on the left of the lake-road 
nearly opposite Crow Park Cottage ; and he will find a plea- 
sant path running round the base of ^ocJtsi^at. 

A little further along, where the road comes out upon the 
lake, is Friar's Crag, a rocky promontory, commanding a fine 
view. Where the artists now sit down to sketch, the monks 
of Lindisfarn used to stand, once a-year, to receive the 
blessing of St. Herbert. There, if the south wind was 
blowing, they might hear, and if the south wind had brought 
rain from the central peaks, they might see, the I^odore fall, 
leaping down the chasm between its two guardian pillars. 
The contrast between this quiet valley and the wild coast of 
Holy Isle must have been as impressive to them as the Saint's 
benediction. 

If, instead of returning direct, the stranger proceeds 
through the meadows on the left to join the Borrowdale road, 
he will pass the spot where Southey would have built his 
house, if he had had * Aladdin's lamp or Fortunatus's purse.' 



"'^E^alfe, 225 

Gray also spoke of the Stable Fields as affording a view 
almost as fine as the one from Crow Park. His mention of 
Scarf Close Reeds, as the name of a fine station, shows that 
he skirted the lake under Walla Crag, where the present Bor- 
rowdale road runs at some height above the margin. The 
tourist may follow his example, pursuing the track along 
the water's edge till at ^arrobi^ag it joins the high-road 
which will lead him back to Keswick. This would add two 
miles and a-half to the v/alk. 



DERWENTWATER. 

(In ordinary weather, it will take three hours to row round the lake ; 
four hours if Barrow and Lodore Falls be visited. The prohibition 
with regard to sailing yachts, we are informed, has been withdrawn.) 

The most permanent attraction to the stranger will pro- 
bably be the lake itself It is not seen in its greatest per- 
fection from its own waters, and yet it is so exquisitely 
beautiful that boating, upon a fine day, is little less than a 
fairy voyage. The waters are singularly clear, and their sur- 
face often unruffled as a mirror, at which time it reflects the 
surrounding shores with marvellous beauty of effect. Sou- 
they, writing to a friend, says — ' I have seen a sight more 
dreamy and wonderful than any scenery that fancy ever yet 
devised for fairy-land. We had walked down to the lake 
side ; it was a delightful day, the sun shining, and a few 
white clouds hanging motionless in the sky. The op- 
posite shore of Derwentwater consists of one long moun- 
tain, which suddenly terminates in an arch, and through 
that opening you see a long valley between mountains, and 
bounded by mountain beyond mountain ; to the right of the 
arch the heights are more varied and of greater elevation. 

Q 



2 26 .K-eslnick ^fettict 

Now, as there was not a breath of air stirring, the surface of 
the lake was so perfectly still that it became one great mirror, 
and all its waters disappeared : the whole line of shore was 
represented as vividly and steadily as it existed in its actual 
being — the arch, the vale within, the single houses far within 
the vale, the smoke from their chimneys, the farthest hills, 
and the shadow and substance joined at their bases so in- 
divisibly, that you could make no separation even in your 
judgment. As I stood on the shore, heaven and the clouds 
seemed lying under me : I was looking down into the sky, 
and the whole range of mountains, having one line of sum- 
mits under my feet, and another above me, seemed to be 
suspended between the firmaments. Shut your eyes and 
dream of a scene so unnatural and so beautiful.' 

At ^toto l]Parft J^antiinu there are plenty of boats for 
hire ; and fishing-tackle can be had of the boatmen. If it 
is intended to fish, terms had better be settled before start- 
ing ; all the necessary equipment for a party, including boat- 
man, should not cost more than ten shillings per day ; for 
a shorter time a bargain must be made. For this privi- 
lege of fishing, however, a ticket, which costs one shil- 
ling, must be obtained from the secretary of the Angling 
Association. This ticket applies also to the rivers. Pike, 
trout, and perch, abound in the lake, but not char, which 
requires deeper water, Derwentwater only being eighty- 
one feet in the deepest part. Its length is nearly three 
miles; and, at its broadest points (Derwentwater Bay) a mile 
and a fifth, thus being no yards narrower than Winan- 
dermere at Lowwood. 

It is impossible, and we think unnecessary, to describe and 
name the features — water, wood, and hill, — which make 
up the various charming combinations as the boat coasts by 
jutting promontories, and into the pretty bays : with the 



"yM'alfts* 227 

help of our maps, or that of the boatman, the information 
is most easily and correctly acquired. Opinions differ on 
this point : — Mr. Payn says, — ' Give us a cigar by all means, 
if the ladies do not object; and let the boatman (and not 
ourselves on any account) pull slowly, just where he will ; 
and let us hold our tongues unless we have anything par- 
ticularly worth hearing ; and that is the way to enjoy Der- 
wentwater, we assure you.' 

The islands of Derwentwater are full of historic interest. 
The Ratcliffes possessed JkortJ's JEslantr, the largest on the 
lake, which was once a part of the mainland, and traces of 
the family residence which stood there are still to be found. 
In the feudal times, they cut a fosse, and set up a draw- 
bridge. Everywhere there are traces of the unhappy family ; 
even in the sky, the aurora borealis being sometimes called 
to this day. Lord Derwentwater's lights, because it was par- 
ticularly brilliant the night after his execution. Ramps 
Holme, another of the islands, was theirs also, and the her- 
mit, the dear friend of St. Cuthbert, who lived on St. 
^]^erij£rt*3 3EsIe in the seventh century, is somehow mixed 
up in legends, or in local imaginations (which are careless 
of dates), with the same family. All that is known of St. 
Herbert is, that he really had an hermitage in the island* 
and that Cuthbert and he used to meet, either at Lindis- 
farn or Derwentwater, once a-year. The legend of their 
deaths is well known : namely, that, according to their prayer, 
they died on the same day. There is beauty in the tradition 
that the man of action and the man of meditation, the pro- 
pagandist and the recluse, were so dear to each other, and 
so congenial. Vicar's, or Berbimt Esk, is the other of the 
four large islands, and a cool and fragrant bower it is. The

floating Islattb, whose appearance is announced at inter- 
vals of a few years, has obtained more celebrity than it de- 
serves. It is a mass of soil and decayed vegetation, which 
rises when distended with gases, and sinks again when it has 
parted with them at the surface. Such is the explanation 
given by philosophers of this piece of natural magic, which 
has excited so much sensation during successive generations. 
Sometimes it comes up a mere patch, and sometimes as 
large as an acre. 

With this boating excursion can be combined a visit to Bar- 
row Fall, Lodore Cascade, and, if time permits, a walk as far 
as the Bowder Stone, each of which we describe elsewhere. 

The principal land-owners in the vicinity of Derwent- 
water, are the Marshalls, of Leeds ; and the estate of the 
late Lord is now in the possession of a member of that 
family ; other members of which possess valuable properties 
at Coniston and Ulls water. 



BARROW WATERFALL. 

(4 miles and a half.) 

The pretty ^alls and ""lESTootig at ^arrolJJ are reached 
by the road on the eastern side of the lake ; or, by boat 
from Crow Park Landing to Barrow Bay. On application 
at the lodge, a guide conducts you through the park and 
among fine trees to the back of the Hall, where the cas- 
cade is discovered, making two great leaps, from rock 
to rock, in all measuring a height of 124 feet. There are 
steps by the side of the falls, which enable the visitor to 
enjoy all the points of view; and there are also some sweet 
paths in the woods which, perhaps, the guide will allow 
you to explore. In any case — whether she does so or 
not, you will pronounce that the little excursion has been 



'^Malk^. 229 

most enjoyable, and that the fall, although perhaps wanting 
the solitary wildness of some others in the district, is very 
pretty and interesting. It is often visited when making a 
circuit of Derwentwater by land, and few strangers who 
row on the lake fail to call ; but we give it as one of the 
pleasant, moderate walks from our head-quarters at Keswick. 



GREAT WOOD. 
(The shortest circuit is about three miles. ) 

Since Gray's time, a charming walk has been created, for 
which the public ought to be very grateful to the owners of 
the Derwentwater property. Gray estimated the perpendi- 
cular part of the Wallow Crags to be four hundred feet in 
height, (and he was not far wrong), adding that the 
country people believed it to be much more. From the 
base of that prodigious wall, the bit of forest called ©teat 
"^ViSf ootl slopes down to the road, and in some parts, down 
to the lake. Through Great Wood winding paths are now 
cleared; and to walk in them in spring and autumn, — 
or indeed at any season when weather will permit, — is 
as rich a treat as can be desired. In one season there 
are the early wild-flowers, the sprouting trees, and the 
wood-pigeons and other birds, pairing and building ; and in 
another, there is the squirrel, amidst the dropping acorns 
and hazel nuts. In winter, the robin hops among the frosted 
leaves in the path ; and there are broader glances of the lake 
and the opposite heights through the leafless trees. There 
are waterfalls always within hearing ; for almost every cleft 
and channel in the crags has its streamlet, ever busy in 
making its way to the lake. 

There are two or three entrances to these wood-paths 
from the Borrowdale road, and a pleasant way home by the 



230 ]Kesb)tcft ^fettict 

northern end of the wood, where the path strikes across the 
field to the coppice called Keswick Springs, whence, among 
several tracks, there is one due north, which leads out 
upon the mail-road at pQtoin 5I?fl|J, just above Keswick, 
on the Ambleside road. 



WALLA CRAG. 
(Four miles and a-half. If extended to Barrow two and a-half more.) 

A walk, involving a little more fatigue, is that to the sum- 
mit of Walla Crag. It is commenced by the Ambleside 
road, along which the walker proceeds until nearly at the 
summit of the first hill called ©TagJtletfgjDf, Here there is a 
turn on the right which will lead him past Castlerigg farm- 
houses to Rakefoot, where a track will be seen, ascending 
to the open ground of Castlerigg Fell. A wall stands in the 
way ; but there is a stile in it. There is then a plantation 
to cross ; and the stranger comes out upon the rocky brow 
which commands a view as fine as any seen from a similar 
elevation, and different from all others ; embracing the whole 
valley of the Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite lakes, with 
the enclosing hills. The chasm which opens downwards 
a little to the left is ^atig'g; ^ISiaftt, the gully through 
which the Countess of Derwentwater escaped with th'e 
family jewels when the officers of the Crown took posses- 
sion of the mansion on l^ord's Island. If the stranger re- 
lishes fatigue and danger, he can get down where the lady 
got up ; or he may recross the stile and descend the Cat- 
gill gorge a little further to the south. He must keep the 
wall of the plantation on his right all the way. There is a 
rough path, but it is not an expedition to be made by any 
one who is not surefooted. This path leads finally across 



"yMalfe* 231 

a field into the road by the lake, less than two miles from 
Keswick. 

There is still another way down. The tourist may pur- 
sue the pony-track along the mountain over the top of 
;Kalcqn ©Ttag, and down to ^artobJ, which affords some 
of the choicest points of view. If he inquires as he goes, he 
may learn the precise spot on which the Castle of the Der- 
wentwater family stood, in the reign of Edward III, when it 
ceased to be the family residence. 



LATRIGG AND DOD FELL. 
(To the summit of both hills and back, 9 miles. ) 
It will be seen by the maps, that ^atrigg is one of the 
spurs or buttresses at the south-west of Skiddaw. It is 
approached by the road towards the railway station, just be- 
fore reaching which, the turn to the right must be taken, be- 
tween the river and the hotel — under the railway — the first 
path on the left, and then the first turn (a lane) on the right. '^' 
1% This leads to the summit, where a grand prospect repays 
the slight exertion. The heights are familiar, excepting, 
perhaps, the Helvellyn mass on the south. 

Probably no one ever pursued the road to Latrigg without 
longing to follow the paths seen to wind through the woods 
above the Greta. Southey in his ' Colloquies,' speaks of the 
scenery here as * of the finest and most rememberable kind. 

From a jutting isthmus, round which the tortuous 

river twists, you may look over its manifold windings, up the 
water to Blencathera; down it, over a high and wooded 

* This point can be reached from the northern end of Keswick, 
by taking a lane in an easterly direction near the toll-gate. There can 
be no difficulty for those who know the point aimed for. 



232 ^E?[.C!3bJtrft ^fotrtct 

middle-ground, to the distant mountains of Newlands, 
Causey Pike and Grisedale.' The scenery of Latrigg, how- 
ever, is treated of in connection with the ascent of Skiddaw. 
The points of view near Bassenthwaite are shown in the 
course of the circuit of the lake ; and the high roads which 
cross the plain may speak for themselves. But the whole 
range along the skirts of Skiddaw, from Latrigg to Bassen- 
thwaite village, (which is eight miles from Keswick), com- 
mands views so fine that the stranger's attention should be 
specially drawn to it. Southey declared, in his ' Colloquies,' 
that ^ the best general view of Derwentwater is from the 
terrace between ^.^ppletljbjaite and X^^tH^^c^* a little before 
the former hamlet. The old roofs and chimneys of the 
hamlet,' he continues, ^ come finely in the foreground, 
and the trees upon the Ormathwaite estate give there a 
richness to the middle-ground which is wanting in other 
parts of the vale.' From that terrace the traveller may 
go on as far as the summit of ©citl ^ell, and will find 
himself abundantly repaid. Dod Fell is an infant Skid- 
daw, nestling under its parent on the western side. The 
ascent is perfectly easy; and the summit commands, not 
only the two lakes, their immediate plain and surrounding 
mountains, but the Vale of Lorton, the Solway, and the 
Scotch range of summits beyond. 



DRUID'S CIRCLE. 

(Four miles. ) 

This very well-preserved memorial of antiquity is reached 

by the road towards the railway station, from which the 

walker diverges before crossing the river. Pass on this turn- 



"SSTalfe. 233 

pike road and through the toll-gate ; then the second road 
on the right must be taken. Shortly after the summit has 
been reached, a stile will be seen on the right, by which we 
enter the field in which are the famous stones we are 
seeking. They are forty-eight in number and form an oval ; 
and there is a peculiarity in this case which distinguishes 
this from all other Druidical monuments extant in England. 
On the eastern side, within the circle, there is a small recess 
formed by ten stones, forming an oblong figure. As Sou- 
they observed, the spot is the most commanding that could 
be chosen, short of a mountain-side : and it is indeed 
nearly surrounded by mountains. 

The old legend about the last human sacrifice of the 
Druids may belong to any of the monuments of that age 
in the district; and is probably claimed for them all. 
According to that old story ; when some people settled in 
a clearing of the woods, beside a river, somewhere to the 
south of the district, the priests took up their station further 
north, among the mountains, where there were plenty of 
stones fit and ready for their temple. After a time, a fever 
laid waste the lower settlement ; and the oracle demanded 
a sacrifice to appease the divine wrath. The lot fell on 
a young girl who was betrothed; and, on an appointed 
day, she was conveyed, with all the ceremonies, to the 
temple. A small hut of wicker-work, like a large bee- 
hive, was found set up on the western side of the tem- 
ple. The girl was led into the circle, and placed in the 
midst, while the dedication proceeded. We are even told that 
she was adorned with an oak garland, and held mistletoe in 
her hand. The whole population was looking on from a 
distance : but it must have been within reasonable reach, as 
every one was required to contribute a stick to the fire. The 
wretched lover saw all from afar ; and he daringly resolved 



234 ^egljjicft ^fettict 

— let the god be as wrathful as he pleased, — not to con- 
tribute so much as a twig to the burning of his beloved. 
She was seen to enter the door, which was next to the circle ; 
and then the priest closed it up, and heaped dry leaves and 
sticks that were brought all round the hut. The arch-druid 
meantime was procuring fire from two pieces of wood. He 
succeeded, and set the pile in a blaze. In this moment of 
desperation, the lover saw every mountain round give forth 
a great cataract ; and all the floods gushed to the temple as 
to a centre, and made an island of the little hut, — returning 
when they had extinguished the fire. The victim came 
forth, with not a hair singed, and not a leaf of her garland 
withered. The arch-druid, skilled to interpret thunder, seems 
to have understood in this case the voice of the waters ; for 
he announced that, henceforth, the god would have no more 
human sacrifices. 

Any resident who is sufficiently familiar with the country 
people to get them to speak their minds fully, will find that 
they still hold to the notion that nobody can count the 
Druid stones correctly ; and also that a treasure is buried 
under the large stone. As to the first,— there are in such 
circles, some smaller stones cropping out of the ground 
which some visitors will, and others will not, include among 
those of the circle. We ourselves counted Long Meg and 
her daughters, near Penrith, many times before making out 
the prescribed sixty-seven, with any certainty. As for the 
treasure, can any one prove that it is not there ? Nobody 
wants to undermine the stone, to get rid of the tradition : so 
our neighbours are like the Arabs at Petra, who have been 
shooting with sling, bow, and matchlock, for a thousand 
years, at the urn where they are sure Pharaoh's treasure is, — 
in the rock temple. For a thousand years they have failed 
to bring it down, and they are determined that no European 



'yM'uVk&. 235 

shall. And no European would dismantle the temple to 
disabuse the Arabs ; and so the tradition and the urn stand 
untouched. So may it be for ages with Long Meg, and the 
giant of eight tons weight that presides over the Keswick 
circle ! 

The return walk may be by Castlerigg. 



PORTINSCALE. 
(Two miles and a half.) 
Immediately after Greta Bridge has been crossed, there 
is, on the left, a most pleasant field-path which leads to ^Pot^ 
tinscale distant about a mile. At this pretty village there 
are two large hotels, one of which (the Derwentwater) has 
grounds stretching to the margin of the lake. The stranger 
will certainly pass this way when on some of the excursions 
to the neighbouring lakes; but we also point it out as a 
tempting walk, which may perhaps be made between showers, 
or in the bright evening of an unpropitious day. It may 
be extended by the western side of the lake, turning south- 
wards, and descending at pleasure to the margin of the water 
through the woods at ^ain ^ark Or Swinside, at the en- 
trance of the Vale of Newlands — little more than two miles 
from Keswick — may be ascended. In any case, the return 
will be by Crosthwaite Church, and probably by Greta Hall. 



CAUSEY PIKE. 

(Four miles to the summit If Grisedale Pike be included in the walk 
— a circuit of ten miles. ) 

This hill, it will be seen, is directly west of Derwentwater, 
and is best approached via Portinscale, Newlands Beck, 
and Stair. If a guide be employed then it will be wise to 



236 ^KlESirfick ^isstrtct 

make the whole round by the ridges which connect Grassmoor 
with Grisedale Pike, whence the descent is easy upon Braith- 
waite, a village two-and-a-half miles from Keswick. This is a 
most lovely circuit, commanding first and last the bright and 
populous valley of the two lakes, and, for the rest of the 
way, the Vale of Newlands, with its quiet sheep-walks and 
folds, and green steeps of Buttermere Hause, and the wild 
recesses of the mountain group occupying the space between 
Crummock Water and Derwentwater ; while to the north- 
west from Grisedale Pike stretches the Vale of Lorton, with 
its multitudinous fields and scattered hamlets, and the 
Cocker winding its way to join the Derwent at Cockermouth. 
The Solway and the Scotch mountains are on the horizon. 
Causey Pike is 1762 feet above Derwentwater. 



CATBELLS. 
(Four miles to the summit. ) 

If the milder enterprise of ascending ©Tatbells is pre- 
ferred, well and good; for that, too, is a charming walk. 
The way is via Portinscale, and on the road turning south- 
ward until the walker is opposite Derwentwater Bay ; then 
the hill must be ascended by a path along the ridge. If he 
does not mind bits of boggy ground he has nothing to fear, 
— always supposing the weather to remain clear, and that 
he has either compass or guide. Looking across the Vale 
of Newlands, he sees the whole group of summits which 
overhang Crummock Water and Buttermere; and if he 
goes on two miles southward, traversing the ridge of 
XMiaitJen PEloax, he looks into Borrowdale, and even sees 
the Langdale Pikes, and the great mountain group about 
Wastwater. 

The descent may be made to ©erineutixrater Bag, where 



E.xcut0fan. 237 

a boat should be ordered to be in waiting. In this case, he 
will reach the road which skirts Catbells at some height 
above the lake, or will turn into the footpath which 
leads through the woods and over the meadows of Brande- 
low Park, coming out upon Derwentwater Bay at Hawse 
End. 

If the walk be extended along the ridge of Maiden Moor, 
the descent will be upon Grange, from whence he might 
reach home in a car which he will have ordered before- 
hand. 



These are the moderate walks about Keswick ; and they 
will occupy a week of fine weather for ordinary walkers. 
Those who remain longer can find plenty more. We have 
only undertaken to point out such as the stranger would be 
most sorry to miss. We will now describe the excursions 
for which a carriage or horses will be needed by any but the 
most robust. 



BORROWDALE, ROSTHWAITE, AND GRANGE. 

(13 miles, exclusive of the digressions to visit Ban-ow Fall and Lodore, 
v^^hich may be estimated at 2 more.) 

The tourist must now be introduced to the valley which 

is, perhaps, at once the most beautiful and also more visited 

by strangers than any other in the Lake District. Many 

of those whose stay at Keswick is short make this their only 

excursion, and that in preference to boating on the lake. If 

there be a party, it is easy to procure a car or wagonette at 



238 ^.es^trft ^fetrict 

one of the hotels ; but the excursion is quite within the 
compass of good walkers. 

The road to be taken is the same as to Castle Head, that 
is, by the eastern side of the lake. Derwentwater is not 
much seen until three-quarters of a mile have been traversed, 
when at the top of a hill, with @»rcat~^2t?'c(Citi on either hand, 
the southern portion comes into view ; after which, all the way 
to Lodore, there are most charming peeps between the trees 
on the margin. In little more than ,two miles, the gate 
admitting to the ^arrobi estate and waterfall is reached. As 
we have said at page 228, strangers are kindly admitted to 
see the latter ; and very few omit to take advantage of the 
privilege. The carriage waits at the gate during the fifteen 
or twenty minutes required for the visit. 

After this, the traveller begins to listen for the ^all of 
JliCitiore. The inn at the fall has been much enlarged lately, 
and is well managed. To visit the Fall the way is through 
the garden and orchard, (where the fish preserves are terrible 
temptations to waste of time), and over the footbridge, and 
up into the wood, where the path leads to a mighty chasm. 
It is the chasm, with its mass of boulders and magnificent 
flanking towers of rock, that makes the impressiveness of 
Lodore fall, rather than the water. No supply short of a 
full river or capacious lake could correct the disproportion 
between the channel and the flood. After the most copious 
rains, the spectacle is of a multitude of little falls, and no- 
where is there a sheet or bold shoot of water. The noise is 
prodigious, as the readers of Southey's description are 
aware : and the accessories are magnificent. Gowder Crag 
on the left, and Shepherd's Crag on the right, shine in the 
sun, or frown in the gloom like no other rocks about any of 
the falls of the district ; and vegetation flourishes everywhere, 
from the pendulous shrubs in the fissures, two hundred feet 



E.3:curi3i0n* 239 

overhead, to the wild flowers underfoot in the wood. On a 
lustrous summer evening, when the lights are radiant, and 
the shadows deep and sharp, the scene is incomparable, 
whatever may be the state of the water. When the stream- 
let is fullest, and the wind is favourable, it is said the fall is 
heard the distance of four miles. 

There is something else to be heard here ; and that is the 
Borrowdale echoes. A cannon is planted in the meadow 
before the inn, which awakens an uproar from the surround- 
ing crags to Glaramara. 

The new and handsome Borrowdale Hotel is shortly- 
reached. By crossing three or four fields from here, an 
interesting establishment for the propagation of char and 
trout will be found. There they are, darting about in their 
separate cisterns, from the tiniest little things to the full- 
grown fish fit for the table. We understand that it is the 
aim of the proprietors to compete in the market with the 
yield from the lakes ; and, if all reports be true in regard to 
the wholesale destruction of spawning fish permitted on the 
shores of the lakes, it is possible they may succeed. 

Following the course of the river Derwent, which feeds 
the lake, in a mile we turn a sharp corner and come rather 
suddenly upon ©ranije. When the abbots of Furness 
owned the whole of Borrowdale, a few monks were placed 
at its entrance to receive and guard the crops; and this 
place was their granary. It is noAV a picturesque hamlet, 
which must be familiar to all who haunt exhibitions of 
pictures. Nobody who carries a pencil can help sitting 
down on the grass to sketch it. Just behind is the bold 
hill, called Lobstone Band, and, to the left, the noble 
wooded rock, called Castle ©Traof, which leaves room only 
for the road and the river. Nimble youths who have reached 
its summit say the view is splendid. It is, in itself, a fine 
spectacle. 



240 ^esbJtck district 

Those who are making the circuit of the lake by land 
turn over the bridge ; our way is straight forward through 
the gate, and onto the ^ o tot £t j© tone — a fallen rock, 
standing on its edge, and about thirty feet high and sixty 
long. There are steps for the ascent to the top ; but it is 
well seen from below. The weight of this enormous stone 
has been computed to be 1900 tons. 

From this point to the village of ^Elogtj^bJaite, the way is 
close to and almost parallel with the river, richly-wooded • 
hill and rock rising steeply on each side. Rosthwaite is 
beautifully situated near the centre of the dale, and at the 
confluence of the two mountain-brooks which form the 
Derwent. 

The traveller is now standing in the middle of that far- 
famed Borrowdale of which so many curious tales are told. 
Its inhabitants were once considered as primitive as we now 
consider those of Watendlath ; and a good deal more, if 
the current stories be true. It is said that an old Borrow- 
dale man was once sent a very long way for something very 
new, by some innovator who had found his way into the 
dale. The man was to go forth with horse and sacks (for 
there were no carts, because there was no road) to bring some 
lime from beyond Keswick. On his return, when he was 
near Grange, it began to rain ; and the man was alarmed at 
seeing his sacks begin to smoke. He got a handful of water 
from the river ; but the smoke grew worse. Assured at 
length that the devil must be in any fire which was aggra- 
vated by water, he tossed the whole load over into the river. 
That must have been before the dalesmen built their curious 
wall j for they must have had lime for that : — Spring being 
very charming in Borrowdale, and the sound of the cuckoo 
gladsome, the people determined to build a wall to keep in 
the cuckoo, and make the spring last for ever. So they 



Excursion* 241 

built a wall across the entrance, at Grange. The plan did 
not answer ; but that was, because, according to the popular 
belief from generation to generation, the wall was not 
built one course higher. It is simply for want of a top- 
course on that wall that eternal spring does not reign in Bor- 
rowdale. Another anecdote shows, however, that a bright 
wit did occasionally show himself among them. A * states- 
man ' (an * estatesman,' or small proprietor) went one day 
to a distant fair, or sale, and brought home what neither he 
nor his neighbours had ever seen before — a pair of stirrups. 
Home he came jogging with his feet in his stirrups ; but, by 
the time he had reached his own door, he had jammed his 
feet in so fast that they would not come out. There was 
great alarm and lamentation ; but as it could not be helped 
now, the good man sat on his horse in the pasture for a day 
or two, his family bringing him food, till the eldest son, vexed 
to see the horse suffering by exposure, proposed to bring 
them both into the stable. This was done ; and there sat 
the farmer for several days, — his food being brought to him 
as before. At length it struck the second son that it was a 
pity not to make his father useful, and release the horse ; so 
he proposed to carry him, on the saddle, into the house. 
By immense exertion it was done ; the horse being taken 
alongside the midden in the yard to ease the fall ; and the 
good man found himself under his own roof again, — spin- 
ning wool in a corner of the kitchen. There the mounted 
man sat spinning, through the cleverness of his second son, 
till the lucky hour arrived of the return of the youngest 
son, who was a scholar, — a learned student from St. Bees. 
After duly considering the case, he gave his counsel. He 
suggested that the good man should draw his feet out of his 
shoes. This was done, amid the blessings of the family ; 
and the good man was restored to his occupation and to 

R 



242 ^EiesbJtcIt ^fettict 

liberty. The wife was so delighted that she said if she had 
a score of children, she would make them all scholars, — 
if she had to begin life again. 

It is by no means to be supposed, however, that there 
was no wit in the valley, but what came from St. Bees. On 
the contrary, a native genius, on one occasion, came to a 
conclusion so striking that it is doubtful whether any univer- 
sity could rival it. A stranger came riding into the dale on 
a mule, and being bound for the mountains, went up the 
pass on foot, leaving the animal in the care of his host. The 
host had never seen such a creature before, nor had his 
neighbours. Fearing mischief, they consulted the wise man 
of the dale ; for they kept a Sagum, or medicine-man, to 
supply their deficiencies. He came, and after an exami- 
nation of the mule, drew a circle round it, and consulted 
his books while his charms were burning, and, at length, 
announced that he had found it 3 the creature must be, he 
concluded, a peacock. So Borrowdale could then boast, 
without a rival, of a visit from a stranger who came riding 
on a peacock. There is a real and strong feeling in the 
district about these old stories. Only a few years ago, when 
a Borrowdale man entered a country inn, a guest who was 
there before said simply * Cuckoo,' and was instantly 
knocked down ; and a passionate fight ensued. 

A party of these dalesmen were once escorting a waggon- 
load of their valuable lead ore to London ; and, it being the 
days when thieves and highwaymen abounded, they were all 
armed with blunderbusses, to guard their treasure. Resting 
the first night at Keswick, they were sheltered in one of the 
houses there, the waggon being placed in the entrance gate- 
way, which was closed by large doors, the men taking it in 
turn to watch. Now it so happened that the owner of the 
house possessed, what was then rather uncommon, a cuckoo 



Excursion* 243 

clock ; when the hour of ten came round, the clock began 
to strike, saying in slow and measured time ^ Cuckoo ! ' 
The Borrowdale man, thinking some of the town-folk, hear- 
ing of their arrival, had come to mock, threatened, if the 
words were repeated, to fire, be the consequences what they 
might ; the clock, of course, was deaf to the threats of the 
enraged and mortified man, and went on repeating * cuckoo ; ' 
this was too much for him, — the man of Borrowdale, — so 
he fired upon his supposed jesters. 

This cannot last much longer, — judging by the new 
houses, — abodes of gentry, — built or building in Borrow- 
dale. The wrath must presently turn to a laugh in the 
humblest chimney-corner in the dale. 



TO WATENDLATH. 
(A circuit of 13 miles.) 

If the tourist desires (as it is hoped that he does), to see 
one of the primitive valleys of the district, — one of those 
recesses lapped in the mountains, where the sounds of 
civilized life have hardly penetrated, let him go to Watend- 
lath, locally called Wathenlath), and descend into Borrow- 
dale at Rosthwaite. The circuit is one of thirteen miles ; 
and part of it must be accomplished on foot or horseback ; 
for there is no direct carriage-road between Watendlath and 
Borrowdale ; the best plan therefore is for the traveller to 
drive to Watendlath, and thence make his way on foot to 
Rosthwaite, (a walk of two miles), where he will have directed 
his carriage to await his arrival. 

The road along the lake-side is followed till it gives out 
a branch before reaching Barrow House. Up this by-road 
the explorer goes, and passes behind and above Barrow 

R 2 



244 ^esbJicft ^fgtrict* 

House, soon reaching the stream that feeds Barrow Fall. 
Presently J^Lsljnesg ^tltge is reached, from which there is a 
much admired scene in a northerly direction, the bold crest 
of falcon ©Trag being on the right, Skiddaw beyond, and 
Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite stretching out below. 
The road is now over the bridge and through the wood. 
Between here and the tarn (about two miles) there are several 
fine points of view which will suggest themselves to the 
enquiring tourist. When we reach the little foot-bridge be- 
tween 3^5? atentJlatlj J^uxn and the verge of the crag, the 
peep down the chasm shews the lake and the Skiddaw range 
in beautiful union. Helvellyn rises to the east, Scafell and 
Bowfell shew themselves in front, all the way down to Borrow- 
dale. The descent into Rosthwaite is the concluding treat. 
The way is easy, — a gentle slope over grass and elastic 
heather, the whole surface starred over with bright heath 
flowers. The head of the dale, — imposing under all 
aspects, — opens out and seems to be spreading its green 
levels for the stranger's rest. The passes to Langdale by 
the Stake, to Wastwater by Sty Head, and to Buttermere by 
Honister Crag, disclose themselves round the projecting 
Glaramara. Further round to the right lies Grange and 
the lake ; and beneath lies ^^Q^i^^nitt with the prattling 
stream behind, which must be crossed by the stone bridge 
to reach the little inn where the traveller will find his carriage 
awaiting him. This inn has lately been enlarged, and now 
offers comfortable accommodation to tourists who may wish 
to remain in this beautiful dale. 

Before turning his face towards the lake, the traveller 
must go forward a few yards from the inn, to a point 
where he will see a narrow entrance and steps in the right- 
hand fence. He must go in there, and mount that little 
hill, called ©aeitlej^eatJ, from which the truest and best 
view of the whole of Borrowdale is obtained. 



Excursion* 245 



TO BUTTERMERE AND CRUMMOCK WATER, BY 
BORROWDALE AND HONISTER PASS. 

(Tf the return journey be by the Vale of Newlands, 22 miles ; if by 

Scale Hill and Lorton Fell, 27 miles. The visit to Scale Force 4 miles 

additional. ) 

The drive to Buttermere by Honister Crag is the favourite 
excursion from Keswick, and it is certainly one which the 
stranger should by no means omit, embracing, as it does, 
some of the finest scenery in the district. For the con- 
venience of tourists, commodious waggonettes make this 
circuit during the season; leaving Keswick at 10 a.m., 
returning at 6 p.m., and thus affording the traveller a sojourn 
of about three hours at Buttermere and Crummock. 

The route as far as Rosthwaite has already been described 
(p. 237) : from whence it is a mile and a-half to ^eatoller* 
After passing through the farmyard there, the road makes a 
steep and rough ascent, by the side of a plunging and roaring 
stream, to Buttermere Hawse. Everybody walks up the last 
reaches of the ascent, — so steep and stony is the narrow 
road, and so formidable its unfenced state. The traveller, 
as he ascends, gradually loses sight of the farmstead, and the 
broader levels until by degrees the mountains close in around 
him. Just at the turn before sighting Honister Crag, the 
last trace of Borrowdale, — in the form of a triangular bit 
of green sward far below among the hills, — disappears, 
and the Vale of Buttermere begins to open upon the eye. 
The scene now before the traveller is one of great grandeur, 
he is in a vast stony valley, where sheep and their folds, and 
a quarryman's hut here and there, are the only signs of civi- 
lization. There are no bridges over the stream — the infant 
Cocker — which must be crossed many times ; and where 
there are no stepping-stones, the pedestrian must wade. The 



246 ^esbjiclt 3§)fetrtct, 

dark, stupendous, almost perpendicular ^]65onfoter (STtag, 
frowns above : and as the traveller, already at a considerable 
height, looks up at the quarrymen in the glate^quatties near 
the summit, it almost takes his breath away to see them 
hanging like summer-spiders quivering from the eaves of a 
house. 

These ^^uatt^men are a hardy race, capable of feats of 
strength which are now rarely heard of elsewhere. No heavy- 
armed knight, who ever came here to meet the Scot — and 
there were such encounters on this spot in the ancient border 
wars — carried a greater weight, or did more wonders in a 
day than these fine fellows. The best slate of Honister 
Crag is found near the top : and there, many hundred feet 
aloft, may be seen by good eyes, the slate-built hovels of 
the quarrymen, some of whom ascend and descend many 
times between morning and night. Now the men come 
leaping down at a speed that appears appalling to strangers. 
Formerly, the slate was brought down on hurdles, on men's 
backs : and the practice is still continued in some remote 
quarries, where the expense of conveyance by carts would 
be too great, or the roads do not admit of it. About forty 
years ago there was a man named Joseph Clark at Honister 
who made seventeen journeys, (including seventeen miles of 
climbing up and scrambling down), in one day, bringing 
down 4 tons 17 cwts. of slate. In ascending, he carried 
the hurdle, weighing 8olbs. ; and in descending, he brought 
each time 64olbs. of slate. At another time he carried, in 
three successive journeys, i,28olbs. each time. His greatest 
day's work was bringing ii,77ilbs. ; in how many journeys 
it is not remembered, but in fewer than seventeen. He lived 
at Stonethwaite, three miles from his place of work. His 
toils did not appear to injure him : and he declared that he 
suftered only from thirst. It was beHeved in that day that 



Excursion* 247 

there was scarcely another man in the kingdom capable of 
sustaining such labour for a course of years. 

In some places where the slate is closely compacted, and 
" presents endways and perpendicular surface, the quarryman 
sets about his work as if he were going after eagles' eggs. 
His comrades let him down by a rope from the precipice ; 
and he tries for a footing on some ledge, where he may drive 
in wedges. The difficulty of this, where much of his strength 
must be employed in keeping his footing, may be conceived : 
and a great length of time must be occupied in loosening 
masses large enough to bear the fall without being dashed 
into useless pieces. But, generally speaking, the methods 
are improved, and the quarries made accessible by tracks 
admitting of the passage of strong carts. Still the detach- 
ing of the slate, and the loading and conducting the carts, 
is work laborious enough to require and train a very ath- 
letic order of men. In various parts of the district, the 
scene is marked by mountains of debris^ above or within 
which yawn black recesses in the mountain side, where the 
summer thunders echo, and the winter storms send down for- 
midable slides into the valley below. 

From Honi^er Crag the road, at first extremely steep, but 
latterly less so, 'descends to the ^uttermere vale. The first 
house we come to is Gatesgarth, — the farmstead whence the 
road to j©carf ©ap is taken, by which, as we have men- 
tioned elsewhere, London gentlemen and Kendal ladies 
have run into such extreme danger. The lake of Butter- 
mere is only a-mile and a-quarter in length, and little more 
than half-a-mile in breadth. The mountains which enclose 
it, beginning on the left, are High Crag, High Stile, and 
Red Pike; on the right, Buttermere Fell, backed up by 
Robinson. The torrent that will be observed flowing down 
the steep into the lake is called — as others in the district 



248 ^esluicfe.^fetrtct 

are — Sourmilk Ghyll : and it issues from Bleaberry Tarn, 
on the side of Red Pike. 

The pretty domain on the margin of the lake is Hasness ; 
and, in another mile, we come to the tiny little chapel on the 
hill-side, and then the village itself Here are two inns, both 
of which have been much improved of late.^ At one of these 
our traveller puts up his horses and himself takes luncheon, 
enquiry being made for char which is more abundant here 
than elsewhere in the district. Both Buttermere and Crum- 
mock yield this most delicious of English fish ; and, we be- 
lieve, Winandermere is the only other lake from which it is 
now taken. Luncheon over, the next object is visiting 
^cale Korce, which is about two miles from the inn. There 
are two ways of accomplishing this, namely, walking the 
whole distance, and, taking a boat from the head of the 
lake to the mouth of the beck which issues from the fall, 
the latter entailing a cost of one shilling for each person, 
or 3s. 6d. for a party. The walk to the boat lies through 

* Now that Buttermere has two good inns, lake visitors not unfre- 
quently make a stay of several days there. For a centre it has many 
recommendations, especially for the pedestrain ; indeed, the village of 
Buttermere is undoubtedly more alpine in its surroundings than any 
other place with moderate population in the district. The principal 
heights are everywhere around, which can hardly be said of Wastwater 
even, where they come down to hills and plains at the foot of the lake. 
Ennerdale may be visited by Scarf Gap ; or the same place may be 
reached by the beck which falls at Scale Force, Floutem Tani being 
passed on the way, and then by the beck which runs down to Eoughton 
Farm, from whence it is only a mile on fair road to Anglers Inn. Again, 
in the Scarf Gap direction, the Pillar Rock, Great Gable, Sty Head, 
and Scafell itself are within an easy day's walk. Wastdale is only ten 
miles away. Langdale can be reached in about fifteen miles, the finest hill 
in the district, Great Gable, being visited on the way. Honister Pass 
and the Borrowdale Valley are close at hand ; and, at home on the 
plain are, besides Buttermere, Crummock Water, Lowes Water, and 
probably the best fishing in the District. Consequently we shall have 
our next head-quarters at Buttermere, from whence the western part 
of the District will be visited. 



i Excursion. 249 

the meadow between the two lakes, by its small patches of pas- 
ture and wooded knolls ; and a pretty walk it is. A short 
row brings the stranger to the mouth of the stream from the 
force ; and he has then to walk a mile among stones, and 
over grass, and past an old fold. The chasm between 
two walls of rock, feathered with bright waving shrubs, 
affords a fall of one hundred and sixty feet, — high enough 
to convert the waters into spray before they reach the ground. 
It is one of the loftiest waterfalls in the country ; and some 
think it the most elegant. There is a point of view not far 
off which the traveller should visit. His boat will take him 
to a little promontory below Mellbreak, called Ling Crag. 
When two hundred yards or rather more above this, he will 
see the two lakes and their guardian-mountains to the 
greatest advantage. 

If our traveller has taken a place on one of the public 
waggonettes, his way home will be by ^uttermere Kaujse 
and the Vale of Newlands. The ascent commences at once 

^^ and continues for a mile and a-half, when an elevation of 1096 
feet is reached. A turn to the left now discloses a new land- 
scape, — the J?i,etrrlant(0 "yFalleg, formed by the rapid slope 
of mountains that are bare of trees, boggy in parts, and else- 
where showing marks of wintry slides, wholly unlike any- 
thing else in the district. Its silence, excepting for the 
bleating of sheep, in ancient folds, down in the hollow ; the 
length and steepness of the descent, and the gloom of the 
mountain — Robinson — with its tumbling white cataract, 
render this truly * a solemn pastoral scene.* In a mile, or so, 

16 latesftatale is passed, after which the views over the rich 
plain, and glimpses into fertile valleys are charming. At 

8K Stair there is evidence of the employment of the inhabitants 
in woollen manufacture, — an ancient staple of the district, 



250 ^mMtk ^District 

as is shown by the inscription which has come down from 
the olden time, engraved on a flagstone : — 

* May God Almighty grant His aid 
To Keswick and its woollen trade. ' 

The hamlet of Swinside is next reached ; then Portinscale, 
with its two hotels ; and finally ^r00t{)ixiaite ©})urc]^, 
which well deserves a visit for other reasons than containing 
the recumbent statue to Southey. It is very old, part of it 
dating back to the 13th century. In one of the windows is 
preserved some stained glass from Furness Abbey, repre- 
senting St. Anthony with bell and book. There is also a 
tomb of the time of Edward III., with a very perfect monu- 
mental brass ; and an old font, curiously carved with em- 
blematic designs. 



But, if we are guiding a walker, or a party in a private 
carriage, we recommend another way home as better than 
that by the Vale of Newlands, — by Crummock Water, 
Scale Hill, and Lorton Fells, which is about five miles further 
than the former. The drive along Crtumm0ck "J^jTatet is 
one of the most charming we know ; especially where the road 
forms a terrace, overhanging the clear waters, sweeping 
round Rannerdale Knot. Nowhere else are the mountains 
so scarred with weather-marks, or so diversified in colouring 
from new rents in the soil. Long sweeps of orange and 
grey stones descend to Crummock Water ; and above, there 
are large hollows, like craters, filled now with deep blue 
shadows, and now with tumbling white mists, above which 



Excursion. 251 

yellow or purple peaks change their hue with every hour of 
the day, or variation of the sky. The bare, hot-looking 
debris on the Mellbreak side, the chasms in the rocks, and 
the sudden swellings of the waters, tell of turbulence in all 
seasons. The most tremendous water-spout remembered 
in the region of the lakes, descended the ravine between 
Grassmoorand Whiteless, in 1760. It swept the whole side 
of Grassmoor at midnight, and carried everything that was 
lying loose all through the vale below, and over a piece of 
land at the entrance, where it actually peeled the whole 
surface, carrying away the soil and the trees, and leaving 
the rocky substratum completely bare. The soil was many 
feet deep, and the trees full-grown. Then it laid down what 
it brought, covering ten acres with the rubbish. By the 
channel left, it appears that the flood must have been five 
or six yards deep, and a hundred yards wide. Among other 
feats, it rooted up a solid causeway, which was supported 
by an embankment apparently as strong as the neighbouring 
hills. The flood not only swept away the whole work, but 
scooped out the entire line for its own channel. The village 
of Brackenthwaite, which stood directly in its course, was 
saved by being built on a stone platform, — a circumstance 
unknown to the inhabitants till they saw themselves left safe 
upon a promontory, while the soft soil was swept away from 
beside their very doors, leaving the chasm where the flood 
had been turned aside by the resistance of their rock. The 
end of the matter was, that the flood poured into the Cocker, 
which rose so as to lay the whole south-western plain under 
water for a considerable time. 

Mellbreak fills up the opposite shore, with its isolated 
bulk ; and Red Pike discloses its crater ; both being streaked 
with red and lead-coloured screes, and tracks of bright ver- 
dure and brighter moss. On the side where the road is, 



252 ^Ktsinicfe ® i^ixitt 

Whiteless, Grasmoor, and Whiteside rear their swelling 
masses; and the road winds pleasantly among fields and 
meadows, till it passes behind the Lanthwaite Woods, and 
turns down, in full view of the rich Vale of Lorton, to 
^cale ^B^lll Inn. This inn should be the traveller's rest- 
ing-place for days together, if he desires a central point 
whence he may visit a great extent of the Lake-country, 
while in command of a variety of pleasures near at hand. 
From Scale Hill he can descend into the Vale of Lorton, 
and enjoy a change from the ruggedness of the dales. Or, 
he may visit the most solemn and imposing of the lakes, — 
Wastwater : and also Ennerdale. He commands all the 
roads to Keswick, and the vales that lie between. Crum- 
mock Water yields char, as well as every other lake-fish, in 
abundance. The mountain tops are accessible, from Low 
Fell, which may be a lady's morning walk, to Red Pike, 
which is a pretty good day's scramble for a stout student. 
There is J^oiXiZ^ "y^^ater at one end of Crummock, and 
Buttermere at the other ; and at home there is a spacious, 
clean, airy house, standing in a pleasant garden. 

A few minutes will take the stranger up to the Station, 
by a path from the inn door. The Station is a hill in Lan- 
thwaite Wood, whence a magnificent view is obtained of a 
stern mountain-group, (the central group of the whole dis- 
trict), on the one hand, and the rich level of Lorton Vale 
on the other, backed, in favourable lights, by the Scotch 
mountains. This spot is one on which to linger through a 
long summer day, pacing the sward, and choosing seats 
from rock to rock, along the whole crest. 

The stranger must now, however, take this brief survey, 
and hope to come again. He has about ten miles to go to 
Keswick : and the early part of it is steep and slow. The 
turn is to the right, at about a mile from Scale Hill, leaving 



n E-Xcursion. 253 

the Cockermouth road, which traverses the y^ ale of Norton, 
The higher he ascends, the more lovely are the views over 
that vale which the traveller obtains, till at length the Sol- 
way gleams in the sun, and the Scotch mountains appear 
beyond. If he has good eyes, the driver will point out to 
him, at a vast distance, the famous old J^ortott 2^^> appear- 
ing like a dark clump, beside a white farmhouse. When 
fairly on Lorton Fell, six or seven miles from Scale Hill, he 
cannot but admire, — in one sense of the word, or the other — 
the colouring of the hill itself, if the time be anywhere from 
June to September. The gaudy hues of the mingled gorse 
and heather are, at that season, unlike any exhibition of 
colour we have seen elsewhere, — exceeding even the far- 
famed American forests. As the north-western vision van- 
ishes, the south-western opens ; and the whole vale of Kes- 
wick with Skiddaw in its noblest aspect, and the lakes far 
below, looks finer than ever. After passing through Braith- 
waite, he soon recognises the road, and returns to Keswick 
^^ by the well-known bridge over the Derwent. 

If the traveller has time, we recommend him, on leaving 
Scale Hill, to go round by the village of Norton and visit 
the famous getog. It adds about two miles to the journey 
to Keswick ; but the road is much better than the shorter 
one, and the valley is very beautiful. 



THE CIRCUIT OF BASSENTHWAITE LAKE. 

(18 miles). 

Bassenthwaite verges towards the flat country, which is 

not what the traveller came to visit. The residents in the 

district become more sensible every year to the beauty of 



254 ^eslMicft district. 

the merely undulating country through which the mountains 
sink into the plains ; while the strangers have hardly patience 
to look at it, in eagerness to find themselves under the sha- 
dow of the great central fells. pSa00ent|}toaite is one of 
the outermost lakes : and it is therefore no more cared for by 
the tourist in general than the foot of Coniston or Winander- 
mere. Still, considering that Skiddaw overshadows its eastern 
shore, it must be worthy of attention ; and the drive round 
it is, to our mind, a very dehghtful one. 

This lake is larger than Derwentwater, being four miles in 
length and a little more than half-a-mile in breadth. The 
distance from lake to lake is between three and four miles, a 
large proportion of which is apt to be flooded in winter ; and 
occasionally the waters actually join, so as to present the 
appearance of a lake ten miles long, — the length of Win- 
andermere. These floods are a serious drawback to the pro- 
ductiveness of the lake levels, and the health and comfort 
of the inhabitants. 

The road passes through Portinscale and Braithwaite to 
Thornthwaite, and leaves Whinlatter on the left. It passes 
through woods and pretty glades, which make a charming 
foreground, while old Skiddaw fills the view on the opposite 
shore. Lord's Seat and Barf rise boldly to the left ; and the 
road runs, for the most part, on the margin of the lake.* 

The Pheasant Inn, near Bassenthwaite Railway station, 
on the western side of the lake, is clean and comfortable, 
and the best resting-place in this circuit. It is a resort 



* About a hundred yards east of Ouse Bridge, there is a gate with a 
path leading through a wood to the foot of the lake. This point of the 
shore offers incomparably the finest view of Bassenthwaite. The whoxe 
length of the lake is seen, with the majestic slopes of Skiddaw on the 
east ; Lord's Seat and Barf on the west, and the head closed in by 
the Walla Crags and Helvellyn. 



E-Xcurston, 255 

of anglers. The road now winds round eastward to Ouse 
Bridge, beneath which the lake discharges itself in the form 
of the much enlarged river Derwent, which flows away 
towards Cockermouth. Not far from the bridge, Arma- 
thwaite Hall is passed. 

If it is thought worth while to go a mile or two out of the 
way for an exceedingly fine view, the traveller will follow 
Hesket road for a mile beyond Castle Inn, and ascend the 
Hawes on the right. Thence he will see a charming land- 
scape, — the open vales of Embleton and the whole expanse 
of the lake, with its rich terraced shores. 

There is one view on his way back which the traveller 
must not miss. When he comes to Bassenthwaite Sand- 
beds, let him leave his conveyance and ascend the moun- 
tain for about 200 yards, when he will get another exceed- 
ingly fine view of the lake, and, indeed, all the way under 
Dod Fell, through ,.^pplet{)b3aite, and by Ormathwaite, the 
views are wide and grand. (See page 232). 



If he is disposed to make a long day's work of this excur- 
sion, he may combine it with the ascent of j©feilitiaiB, He 
will begin with the mountain first, descending, if on foot, by 
Longside. If he has a pony he must come down further to 
the north. It is customary for those who ride to descend 
on the Keswick side, but guides who know the mountain 
well, do not hesitate to conduct ladies on their ponies by 
this northern route. The tourist comes into a good path 
before he reaches Barkbath, and soon after descends into the 
main-road. He will then pursue his way round Bassen- 
thwaite, reversing the order of the proceeding as given 
above.

ST. JOHN'S VALE AND THIRLMERE. 
(18 miles.) 

This excursion is commenced on the Penrith road. In 
about four miles 5U|[reHteltl ^Kall is reached, now a dilapi- 
dated farmhouse, but with a high romance associated with 
it. Here was brought up in humble but safe seclusion, the 
young Clifford, son of that worthless noble who slew the 
young Earl of Rutland, and, therefore, for whose innocent 
blood the swords of York were all athirst : 

* There, at Blencathara's rugged feet, 
Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat 
To noble Clifford, — from annoy 
Concealed the persecuted boy.' 

He dwelt as a shepherd here for four-and-twenty years, 
without learning even so much as to read and write, but 
leading, as it seems, a very contented life, under the pro- 
tection of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, who had married his 
mother, and behaved to him with a generosity very unusual 
with stepfathers of that period. On the succession of 
Henry VII., he was restored to his estates ; and conducted 
himself in such a manner as to exchange the tide of ' The 
Shepherd Lord' for that of ' The good Lord Clifford.' 

* In him the savage virtues of his race — 
Revenge and all ferocious thought — were dead ; 
Nor did he change ; but keep in lofty place 
The wisdom which adversity had bred. ' 

In visiting Threlkeld, we have slightly overshot one of the 
fairest scenes within a day's ramble of Keswick — the 
Valley of St. John. This should be always approached in 



g Excursion* 257 

this direction (from the north) and on wheels rather than 
on foot, as the road lies between hedgerows. The valley 
runs directly southward from Threlkeld, with White Pike 
and Great Dodd, limbs of Helvellyn, bold on the left, and, 
in front is the famed ©astle ^odt, apparently barring 
the defile. The greatest of British descriptive poets has 
thus described it in his Bridal of Triermain : — 

** Paled in by many a lofty hill, 
The narrow dale lay smooth and still ; 
And, down its verdant bosom led, 
A winding brooklet found its bed." 

For rich pastoral beauty, and grandeur that is nevertheless 
homelike, ^t. J^oj^it's "^iTale excels even in this favoured re- 
gion ; and we do not know anything more charming than the 
paths and lanes which lay off to the west of the high-road. 
About four miles from Threlkeld, the valley joins the 
8 high-road from Ambleside to Keswick, close to Thirl- 
mere. This singular mere, lying as it does between the 
two more famous lakes of Derwentwater and Grasmere, 
has always been underrated; and the tourist is generally 
content with the not very attractive view of it which he 
9K gains from the coach-road. The lake is reached by a lane 
on the right, just beyond the inn at Dale Head* The white 
house on the opposite shore is the one stated to be haunted ; 
but, in the broad daylight, you will probably not be agitated 
by that circumstance. 

Crossing the picturesque bridge (reported to be Roman), 

raised high for fear of floods, take the path southwards as 

■)% far as Lawnchy, or ^attcg ©ill, and, if possible, pursue 

>K that stream to its source. (See Ambleside Section, p. 130). 

When you have visited it, it will be time to go home. Do 

not cross the bridge now, but keep the west shore under the 

s 



258 Ji£3lBick 3S)fetrict 

fine frowning rock of ^.aglc dTrag* The mansion opposite 
is Dale Head Hall, — a very pleasant residence for those who 
object to be incommoded by morning callers. Then, under 
^^atrcn ©Trag (a glorious walk) to Smaithwaite Bridge, once 
more on the high-road to Keswick, whose vale, after a few 
miles of moorland, you will presently behold from the far- 
famed stand-point of ^astleri(j0» 

This day's pleasure (which can, of course, be cut in pieces, 
although our advice is not to waste fine weather) can 
scarcely be enjoyed, at all events as far as Lancey Gill is 
concerned, except by persons who can endure some fatigue, 
and are not averse to scrambling ; but to the young and 
active, even of the fair sex, we know of no expedition more 
delightful, and especially if they know how to use their 
sketch-books. 



THE ASCENT OF SKIDDAW. 

(12 miles. Time, from 3^^ to 5 hours. A pony is charged 3s. 
and a guide 6s.) 

The ascent of jSMbtiaiB is easy, even for ladies, who have 
only to sit their ponies to find themselves at the top, after a 
ride of six miles. There must be a guide,— -be the day 
ever so clear, and the path ever so plain. Once for all let 
us say, in all earnestness and with the most deliberate de- 
cision, that no kind of stranger should ever cross the higher 
passes, or ascend the mountains without a guttle* Surely, 
lives enough have been lost, and there has been suffering 
and danger enough short of fatal issue, to teach this lesson. 
But the confident and joyous pedestrain is not the most 
teachable of human beings. In his heart he despises the 
caution of native residents, and in his sleeve he laughs at it. 



J^gcmt of ^feilibaiaj. 259 

The mountain is right before him; the track is visible 
enough ; he has a map and a guide-book, and boasts of his 
pocket-compass. With the track on his map, and the track 
on the mountain, how could he get wrong ? So he throws 
on his knapsack, seizes his stick, and goes off whisthng or 
singing, — the host and hostess looking after him as he strides 
away. For some time he thinks he can defy all the mislead- 
ing powers of heaven and earth : but, once out of human 
help, he finds his case not so easy as he thought. Instead 
of one path, as marked on his map, he finds three ; and 
perhaps the one he relies on may lapse into swamp. He 
finds himself on the edge of a precipice, and does not know 
how far to go back. He finds the bog deepen, and thinks 
he can scarcely be in the right road. He finds a landslip, 
which compels him to make a wider circuit, and meantime 
it is growing dusk. Worst of all a fog may come on at any 
moment ; and there is an end of all security to one who 
does not know the little wayside-marks which guide the 
shepherd in such a case. Tales are current through the 
region of the death of natives, even in the summer-months, 
through fog, wet, fatigue, or fall, though the native has a bet- 
ter chance than the stranger ten times over. And why should 
the risk be run ? It cannot be to save the fee, in the case 
of a journey of pleasure. The guide is worth more than 
his pay for the information he has to give, to say nothing of 
the comfort of his carrying the knapsack, — as many knap- 
sacks as there are walkers. If solitude be desired, the medi- 
tative gentleman will soon find that anxiety about the way, 
and an internal conflict with appreliensiveness, are sad 
spoilers of the pleasures of solitude. Better have a real 
substantial, comfortable, supporting shepherd by his side, 
giving his mind liberty for contemplation and enjoyment of 
the scene, than the spectres of the mountain perplexing him 

s 2

on all sides, and marring his ease. But enough. Travellers 
who know what mountain-climbing is, among loose stones, 
shaking bog, and slippery rushes or grass, with the alternative 
of a hot sun or a strong wind, and perpetual liability to mist, 
will not dispute the benefit of having a guide ; and novices 
ought to defer to their judgment. If we have seemed to 
dwell long on this point, it is because warning is grievously 
wanted. It will probably not be taken by those who need it 
most ; but it ought to be offered. — Even in the mild ascent 
of green Skiddaw, then, there is need of a guide. 

The way is in the direction of the Railway Station. — 
After passing round the gardens of the hotel and under the 
railway, there is a sharp turn to the left. Continue on this 
road (which is nearly parallel with the railway in a northerly 
direction) for about a third of a mile, when Spooney Green 
Lane will be seen on the right, at the corner of which is a 
guide-post, directing to Skiddaw. When this lane has been 
traversed for about a third of a mile, pass through the gate 
in front. The path is distinct, but a slight divergence here 
mto the field will give a wonderfully fine view of the plain 
of Keswick, with its two lakes, and of Borrowdale, and the 
surrounding mountains. His own way is now on the side of 
Lon scale Fell, and in the direction of what is called Skiddaw 
Forest, a large tract of moorland, but destitute of trees. 
The traveller soon passes the King of Saxony's Well, 
so called because the King of Saxony and his party dined 
here when they ascended Skiddaw. If the stranger is thirsty, 
he must stop to refresh himself here, for this is the only 
water he will get till he descends. The plain of Kes- 
wick, and the lake and its islands now grow smaller, 
and the surrounding mountains seem to swell and rise as 
the road gently climbs the side of Skiddaw. When about 
half-way up, the lower world disappears, while the more dis- 



.Ascent of ^fettitialB. 261 

tant one comes into view. The Irish Sea and the Isle of Man 
rise, and the Scotch mountains show themselves marshalled 
on the horizon. At the first summit, the city of Carlisle 
comes into view, with the coast and its little towns, round to 
St. Bees, with the rich plains that lie between. But there is 
a higher point to be reached after an ascent of six hundred 
feet more ; and here Derwentwater comes into view again. 
And how much besides ! Few lakes are seen ; but the sea 
of mountain-tops is glorious, — and the surrounding plains, 
— and the ocean beyond, — and land again beyond that. 
In opposite directions, lie visible, Lancaster Castle and the 
hills of Kirkcudbright, Wigton, and Dumfries. Lancaster 
Castle and Carlisle Cathedral in the same landscape ! and 
Snowdon and Criffel nodding to each other ! Ingleborough 
in Yorkshire, looking at Skiddaw over the whole of West- 
morland that lies between : with the Isle of Man as a rest 
ing-place for the glance on its way to Ireland ! St. Bees 
Head, with the noiseless waves dashing against the red rock, 
being almost within reach as it were ! And as for Scafell, 
Helvellyn, and Saddleback, they stand up like comrades, 
close round about. Charles Lamb was no great lover of 
mountains, but he enjoyed what he saw. * O ! its fine 
black head,' he wrote of Skiddaw, * and the bleak air atop 
of it, with a prospect of mountains all about, making you 
giddy; and then Scotland afar off, and the border-counties, 
so famous in song and ballad ! It is a day that will stand 
out like a mountain, I am sure, in my life ! ' ' Bleak' the 
air is indeed * atop,* — exposed as the summit is to the sea- 
winds. If the stranger desires to take a leisurely view, he 
must trouble his guide or his pony with a railway wrapper, 
or something of the sort, to enable him to stand his ground. 
The descent may be made, for the sake of variety, by a 
road through Millbeck and the pretty village of Applethwaite; 



262 ^Kcsluicft district 

or by the west side of the mountain, and coming out upon 
the road, just north of the village of Bassenthwaite. It 
is often made, if the travellers are on foot, by Longside. 
This arm of the mountain is one of its leading characteris- 
tics, as seen from the top. The guides have given it the 
name of Gibraltar, since they were told of its singular re- 
semblance to that place. If a more northerly descent is 
chosen, a small tarn comes into view. This is Overwater. 

It is easy to pass from Skiddaw to the top of Saddle- 
back, about six miles of hill work. The best direction is 
by the gamekeeper's cottage, and then by the high side of 
Lonscale Fell and Raughton Gill. The latter portion has 
a well-marked track. 



THE ASCENT OF SADDLEBACK, 
(ii miles of road and 5 of mountain work.) 

There is no difficult work in the ascent of j^atiblrfjacfe 
(formerly Blencathra) ; the railway can be taken to Threl- 
keld, which reduces the pedestrian work to 6 miles, and that 
latter can be done on ponies. The villagers at JE^&t^^ft^^^ 
will point out a path up Gate Gill, which goes almost direct 
up the mountain from there ; but the better way is to go on 
the road another two miles to the toll-gate at ^©caUg, 
where there is a piece of open ground on the left. This 
latter is to be crossed to a gate which opens upon the hill- 
path, leading on the breast of jSoutj^er JRtlL For nearly 
a mile a wall is followed in an easterly direction ; then turn 
to the left into the depression where the infant stream 
Glenderamachin runs. This leads up to j^calcs JE^arn, 
from whence the top is visible and easily reached. 

Souther Fell, over which we have just passed, is the 



J^Lscent of .Satil(le6aclt» 263 

very home of superstition and romance. This Souther 
or Soutra Fell, is the mountain on which g!j03tg; appeared 
in myriads, at intervals during ten years of the last 
century; presenting the same appearances to twenty- 
six chosen witnesses and to all the cottages within view of 
the mountain ; and for a space of two hours and a-half at 
one time — the spectral show being closed by darkness ! 
The mountain — be it remembered — is full of precipices, 
which defy all marching of bodies of men ; and the north 
and west sides present a sheer perpendicular of 900 feet. 
On midsummer eve, 1735, a farm-servant of Mr. Lancaster's, 
half-a-mile from the mountain, saw the eastern side of its 
summit covered with troops, which pursued their onward 
march for an hour. They came, in distinct bodies, from an 
eminence, on the north end, and disappeared in a niche at 
the summit When the poor fellow told his tale, he was 
insulted on all hands ; as original observers usually are when 
they see anything wonderful. Two years after — also on a 
midsummer eve, — Mr. Lancaster saw some men there, 
apparently following their horses, as if they had returned 
from hunting. He thought nothing of this ; but he hap- 
pened to look up again ten minutes after, and saw the figures, 
now mounted, and followed by an interminable array of 
troops, five abreast, marching from the eminence and over 
the cleft as before. All the family saw this, and the man- 
oeuvres of the force, as each company was kept in order by 
a mounted officer, who galloped this way and that. As the 
shades of twilight came on, the discipline appeared to relax 
and the troops intermingled, and rode at unequal paces, till 
all was lost in darkness. Now, of course, all the Lancasters 
were insulted, as their servant had been : but their justifi- 
cation was not long delayed. On the midsummer eve of 
the fearful 1745, twenty-six persons, expressly summoned 



264 JBiegixJicfe ^fetrfct, 

by the family, saw all that had been seen, and more. Car- 
riages were now interspersed with the troops ; and every 
body knew that no carriages ever had been, or could be, on 
the summit of Souther Fell. The multitude was beyond 
imagination ; for the troops filled a space of half-a-mile, and 
marched quickly till night hid them, — still marching. There 
was nothing vaporous or indistinct about the appearance of 
these spectres. So real did they seem, that some of the 
people went up the next morning to look for the hoof-marks 
of the horses ; and awful it was to them to find not one 
footprint on heather or grass. The witnesses attested the 
whole story on oath before a magistrate ; and fearful were 
the expectations held by the whole country side about the 
coming events of the Scotch rebeUion. It now came out 
that two others had seen something of the sort in the inter- 
val, viz., in 1743, but had concealed it, to escape the in- 
sults to which their neighbours were subjected. Mr. Wren, 
of Wilton Hall, and his farm-servant, saw, one summer 
evening, a man and a dog on the mountain, pursuing some 
horses along a place so steep that a horse could hardly by 
any possibility keep a footing on it. Their speed was pro- 
digious, and their disappearance at the south end of the fell 
so rapid, that Mr. Wren and the servant went up the next 
morning, to find the body of the man, who must have been 
killed. Of man, horse, or dog, they found not a trace : and 
they came down and held their tongues. When they did 
speak, they fared not much better for having twenty-six 
sworn comrades in their disgrace. As for the explanation, 
— the Editor of the * Lonsdale Magazine * declared (Vol. ii. 
p. 313), that it was discovered that on that midsummer eve 
of 1745, the rebels were ^exercising on the western coast of 
Scotland, whose movements had been reflected by some 
transparent vapour, similar to the Fata Morgana.' This is 



JSLscent of ^atitilefiacft. 265 

not much in the way of explanation : but it is, as far as we 
know, all that can be had at present. These facts, how- 
ever, brought out a good many more ; as the spectral march 
of the same kind seen in Leicestershire, in 1107: and the 
tradition of the tramp of armies over Helvellyn, on the eve 
of the battle of Marston Moor. And now the tourist may 
proceed, — looking for ghosts, if he pleases, on Souther Fell. 
Here, too, lies another wonder, — that tarn (Scales Tarn) 
which is said to reflect the stars at noonday, — a marvel 
which we by no means undertake to avouch. The tarn is 
situated at the foot of a vast precipice, and so buried among 
crags, that the sun never reaches it, except through a crevice 
in early morning. This dark water is one of the attractions 
which bring strangers to this mountain ; though the easy 
ascent of Skiddaw better suits the greater number. Another 
attraction here is the deeper solitude of the recess of old 
Blencathra, — as Saddleback should still be called. An- 
other IS the view of Derwentwater from the summit. Sou- 
they says, * Derwentwater, as seen from the top of Saddle- 
back, is one of the finest mountain scenes in the country.' 
The summit is called Linthwaite Fell ; and there the guide 
will point out the various objects, seas, islands, castles in 
their woods, and cities of the plain; mountains, far and 
near; shores, like the boundaries of an estate, and lakes 
like its fish-ponds. People, who made the ascent sixty years 
since, have left a terrifying account of its dangers, such as 
now excites a smile among energetic tourists. One gentle- 
man was so ' astonished with the difierent appearance of 
objects in the valley beneath,* that he chose to stay behind. 
Another of the party presently * wished to lose no blood 
and return : ' but he was coaxed onward to the tarn, where, 
however, he could see no stars, though it was noonday. Mr. 
Green, with his companion, Mr. Otley, was among the early 



266 ^KesbJtcfe district 

adventurers who stood on the highest ridge. He was so 
accurate an observer that his descriptions of unfrequented 
and unalterable places will never be antiquated. 'From 
Linthwaite Pike/ he says, * on soft green turf, we descend 
steeply, first southward, and then in an easterly direction to 
the tarn, — a beautiful circular piece of transparent water, 
with a well-defined shore. Here we found ourselves en- 
gulphed in a basin of steeps, having Tarn Crag on the north, 
and rocks falling from Si^atp lEbge on the east, and on the 
west, the soft turf on which we made our downward pro- 
gress. These side-grounds, in pleasant grassy banks, verge 
to the stream issuing from the lake, whence there is a charm- 
ing opening to the town of Penrith ; and Cross Fell is seen in 
the extreme distance. Wishing to vary our line in returning 
to the place we had left, we cross the stream, and commence 
a steep ascent at the foot of Sharp Edge. We had not gone 
far before we were aware that our journey would be attended 
with perils ; the passage gradually grew narrower, and the 
declivity on each hand awfully precipitous. From walking 
erect, we were reduced to the necessity either of bestriding 
the ridge or of moving on one of its sides, with our hands 
lying over the top, as a security against falling into the tarn 
on the left, or into a frightful gully on the right, — both of 
immense depth. Sometimes we thought it prudent to return, 
but that seemed unmanly, and we proceeded ; thinking with 
Shakspeare that " dangers retreat when boldly they're con- 
fronted/' Mr. Otley was their leader, who, on gaining steady 
footing, looked back on the writer, whom he perceived 
viewing at leisure from his saddle the remainder of his up- 
ward course.' On better ground they had a retrospect of 
Sharp Edge, — which is the narrowest ridge on Saddleback, 
or any other north-of-England mountain. In places, it is 
composed of loose stones and earth ; and, the stepping on 



the sides being as faithless as at the top, the Sharp Edge 
expedition has less of safety in it than singularity. And 
now, — those who, after this, like to go there, know what to 
expect. 

The other mountain-lake, lying north-east of this, and 
called ;©J3lrf0caIe Jl^arnis also reputed to reflect the stars at 
noonday, but under so many conditions that it will be a 
wonder if anybody ever has the luck to see them. It is in 
this tarn that, in the belief of the country people, there are 
two fish which cannot die ; — the same fish that used to wait 
on the pleasure of the good Lord Clifford upon the moun- 
tain, when, in his shepherd days, he learned mathematics 
from the stars. 

The traveller can either return by the way he came, or by 
Knowe Crags down upon Threlkeld ; but the most common 
course is almost due south-west on the green slope.*' On 
nearing the Glenderaterra beck, which runs in the hollow 
between Saddleback and Skiddaw, paths will be discovered 
conducting down to the highway. Those, however, who 
intend returning by railway, will veer round southwards 
towards Threlkeld. 



ASCENT OF HELVELLYN. 

(15 miles of road and 5^ of mountain-work.) 

The ascent of Helvellyn is best made from 51?]&itfep0t, 
sometimes called Legberthwaite, and by the post-office 
named Dale Head. The Ambleside road should be fol- 
lowed for six miles, as far as the King's Head Inn, which 
we have already noticed as being near the point where the 

* The footpath, due westwards, in the direction of the summit of 
Skiddaw must be avoided, and left on the right. 



268 ;K:ei3tnfcft ^District 

road branches off for the Vale of St. John. At the back of 
the inn there is a pony track for a considerable way up the 
mountain, till a plateau is reached. Here the track is 
scarcely visible, but, aiming for the top, there is no difficulty 
in finding the way. On leaving the plateau there is a ridge 
to climb from which you see Kepple Cove Tarn on the left. 
The summit of this ridge is called Little Helvellyn. The 
pedestrian then follows on to the summit, keeping the 
highest ground, with Catchedecam on the left. The view 
from the summit is described in the Ambleside Section, p. 132 

By way of changing the views, the tourist can descend to 
Wythburn by aiming forward from the top to the first 
rivulet on the right, close by which will be seen the path 
which descends to the Nag's Head at ^^^Stputn, where 
there is a comfortable road-side inn at which good provisions 
and accommodation may be had. In the season, coaches 
pass this inn frequently ; they may be useful for tourists 
returning to Keswick, distant about nine miles and a 
quarter. 

The descent to Patterdale should be made by the Swirrel 
Edge and across the boggy ground until the path from the 
Striding Edge is joined: the track from this point into 
Grisedale offers no difficulty. This is fully described in the 
Patterdale Section. 



TO WASTWATER AND BUTTERMERE BY STY HEAD, 

BLACK SAIL, AND SCARF GAP. 

(A circuit of 33 miles). 

To visit Wastwater and Buttermere, in the same day, from 

Keswick is a long excursion, and should only be undertaken 

by those who are prepared to suffer a little fatigue. But the 

tourist will be amply repaid for his trouble by the glorious 



Excursion. 269 

scenery he will enjoy on his way. The expedition is one 
often made from Keswick, so that he will find guides ready 
to show him the way, and make the necessary preparations 
so as to ensure his return before night. As we have in the 
next section described the principal features of this route, 
we shall now only indicate the chief points of interest on 
the way, and the easiest way of doing the work ; those who 
have legs good enough for the work can of course use them 
if they please. 

The tourist, who does not rely solely on his legs, can 
drive through Borrowdale, as far as Seathwaite, (see p. 237) 
and then take ponies, which his guide will have sent on 
beforehand. It is a mile and a-half from ^Etostj^inaite to 
^eatolkr farm ; then the same distance forward up the 
valley to Seatfjinaite, a hamlet in the gorge of the fells. 
In pursuing the latter, he will find no * nuts and acorns ' 
in this * Boredale,' nor any remarkable number of swine ; 
but he may see the place, — if he looks up the hill- 
side to the right, — whence is drawn the product that has, in 
modern times, distinguished the dale, — the blacklcati of 
which the Keswick pencils are made. 

Under the mine, amidst the copsewood, are the dark tops 
of the Borrowdale "^eins to be seen, of which Wordsworth 
says : — 

* Those fraternal four of Borrowdale, 
Joined in one solemn and capacious grove, 
Huge trunks, and each particular trunk a growth 
Of intertwisted fibres, serpentine, 
Up-coiling, and inveterately convolved : 
Nor uninformed with phantasy, and looks 
That threaten the profane ; — a pillared shade, 
Upon whose grassless floor of red-brown hue, 
By sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged 
Perennially — beneath whose sable roof 



270 JKes^icfe district 

Of boughs, as if for festal purpose, decked 

With unrejoicing berries — ghostly shapes 

May meet at noon-tide ; Fear and trembling Hope, 

Silence and Foresight ; Death the skeleton 

And Time the shadow ; — there to celebrate, 

As in a natural temple scattered o'er 

With altars undisturbed of mossy stone. 

United worship ; or in mute repose 

To lie, and listen to the mountain flood 

Murmuring from Glaramara's inmost caves. 

The size attained by the yew in this district is astonishing. 
One, which for many years lay prostrate at the other end 
of Borrowdale, measured nine yards in circumference, 
and contained 1,460 feet of wood. The famous Lorton 
Yew (see p. 253) has about the same girth; and one of 
these four measures seven yards round. 

Having surveyed these objects, and arrived at Seathivaite, 
the carriage must be vacated and sent round by Honister 
Pass to Buttermere, to wait our arrival there eight hours 
afterwards. The ponies, which have been here some 
time, and had a feed and rest, are now mounted. There is 
still three-quarters of a mile of comparatively level ground, 
with the hills rising steeply on both sides, until jStocWeu 
JBritifje is reached, where the ascent, after crossing the 
bridge and facing the west, commences in earnest. The 
zig-zags up Greenhow Knott are, however, clearly marked. 
After about a mile of it, comparatively easy ground is gained, 
still running near to the beck leading to Slgj^eati STarn, 
The tarn is passed on the western side, and the summit of 
Sty Head (1578 feet) reached in a few hundred yards be- 
yond. The descent of three miles to the little village of 
Wastdale Head is gradual, but stony, on the slope of J^ittg^ 
mell ; the pedestrian may, however, easily pick better ground 
than the pony-track.

The two fine waterfalls, called Peers Gill and Gerta Gill, 
in the side of Lingmell, had better be left for another day, 
if the whole of the proposed round is to be accomplished. 

^K There is now a small inn at "JZSTasttiale ^eati where 
luncheon can be ordered, and, while prepared, it will be in- 
teresting to walk as far as the head of the lake, (a mile and 
a quarter) and see the grand Screes which rise up almost 
like a wall on its eastern side. 

^6M A stay of two hours may be afforded at Wastdale Head ; 
after which the journey must be resumed in the same direc- 

17 tion as we arrived, but, at the fork of the beck, (only a 
quarter of a mile from the inn), the path to the left must be 
taken. For a mile it is along the meadows of X^Elosetiale 

18 "^alleg at the foot of Kirkfell, after which the ISIarit Sail 
Pass commences rather steeply ; this does not, however, last 

20 more than half-a-mile, the next mile to the summit (1750 ft.) 
being average climbing, with convenient zig-zags. The path 
is distinct all the way, therefore there is no need to confuse 
the traveller with details about the fences and tiny rivulets 
coming from the heights which have to be crossed ; and, 
again, our maps point out more distinctly than words the 
hills which are around. Now we descend, and shortly cross 

20% the river Liza, on a plank if it does not happen to be washed 
away by that occasionally swollen stream. In half-a-mile 
more, the path forks, that on the left leading down to En- 
nerdale, and the other in our direction towards Buttermere. 

22 From this point to the summit of Scarf ffiap there is a rise 
of about 600 feet, when ^JButtcrmere and its surroundings 
come into full view. From here to the meadows below is 
the steepest part of the excursion, and ponies must be led. 

23^ Here (Gatesgarth Farm) we find our carriage, and, after 
some more refreshment at one of the inns, proceed on our 

33 journey by the Vale of Newlands to Keswick, (page 249.) 



272 JiesbDicfe district. 



THE ASCENT OF SCAFELL. 

(Thirty miles : — i8 of road and 12 of mountain-work. Ponies can 
be taken as far as Esk Hause. ) 

The easiest way of ascending Scafell from Keswick is to 
proceed, precisely as in the last excursion, as far as j^tg^ 
fjeati 5I?arn,* from whence to ^ptmbUns 5E^atn there is a 
distinct track, in a southerly direction, almost the whole 
way, which, however, is not more than three-quarters of a 
mile, and there is the streamlet, which connects the two 
tarns, running close by as an additional guide. This stream- 
let has to be crossed about midway between the two tarns, 
and again at Sprinkling Tarn. The track almost imme- 
diately leaves the tarn, in a south-easterly direction, and 
aims for rounding the rocky crest of Great End. This 
done, (half-a-mile) there must be a still further leaning to the 
right, and the grassy slope ascended for about half a-mile 
to K«3fe ^K^ause (2490 feet) where there is a grand prospect. 
Now the course is almost due west for half-a-mile, in the 
direction of ©teat Ent», on reaching the rocky debris at the 
foot of which, guiding stones will be found and a fairly- 

* There is a ' short cut,' by which the distance is shortened about a 
mile each way ; but, over that ground, the path is not so distinct and 
practicable, and it is qnestionable whether the work would be done in 
any less time unless by the most experienced cragsman. The deviation 
from the above route is at Siockley Bridge. Instead of turning west- 
ward there, the way is direct up the valley on the skirts of the hill on 
the western side of the beck. This is continued for somewhat more 
than a mile, when the rocky crests of Sprinkling Crags seem to bar 
progress. Avoid this obstacle by crossing the beck before reaching 
Ruddy Gill, and take to the better but still rough ground on the other 
side. In a few hundred yards we come upon the Esk Hause track, 
almost at right angles, immediately under the rocky mass of Great End, 
and close to Sprinkling Tarn. 



fMimrdmn '^xcnxmn. 273 

marked track to the summit of the Pike, in a south-westerly ' 
direction. There are plots of grass, but rough, rocky ground 
prevails during this mile of the ascent to the highest point 
in England. At the second grass plateau, the pike itself 
comes into sight, and there is no more difficulty excepting 
the physical exertion. 

There is a description of the summit at page 138. Only 
three lakes are seen, — Windermere, Derwentwater, and 
Wastwater. The principal heights are Helvellyn Fairfield, 
High Street, Ingleborough, Langdale Pikes, Bow Fell, 
Coniston Old Man, Black Combe, Great End, Skiddaw, and 
Saddleback. Nearer are Grassmoor, Green Gable, Steeple, 
Pillar, Kirk Fell, and Great Gable. 

The descent may be made either to Langdale or Wast- 
dale Head. For the former, let the pedestrian return to 
Esk Hause, and then, by noticing the guiding-stones which 
mark the way in the direction of Langdale, he will come to 
Angle Tarn, and shortly after passing this the top of Rosset 
Gill is reached, down which there is a rough descent to the 
head of Langdale. (see page 135). 

The descent to Wastdale is generally made down the 
slopes of Lingmell. See Buttermere Section. 



ASCENT OF GREAT GABLE AND GREEN GABLE. 

( Twenty-five miles. — 19^ of road, and 5f of mountain work. The 
former can, of course, be done on ponies, or by conveyance). 

It would be easy to point out at least three ways of ascend- 
ing Great Gable, from Keswick ; but, to the uninitiated, we 
unhesitatingly say go direct to ^tg 'M.tB.ti 3?arn, as at 
page 269, from whence it is only a mile and a quarter, on a 

T 



2 74 ^eslnicJt ^fetttct. 

green slope to the summit. Cross the little rivulets which 
run into the Tarn on its western side, and then leave the 
path and turn to the right, climbing steadily on the side of 
the hill in a north-westerly direction and avoiding the de- 
pression on the right. In this short distance 1483 feet have 
to be ascended, so we need hardly say it is steep, but it 
is at the same time gradual and there is no difficulty about 
the way. We would say, keep under the ridge on the left 
until near the summit. 

All authorities agree that the prospect from this is 
superior to that from any other English, or perhaps Welsh, 
mountain. On all sides, it is magnificent. To the north, 
the eye stretches over the valley of the Derwent to the Scotch 
hills; westward, the great hills close to us block out the 
lakes in that direction ; but, on turning southward, we have 
another glorious opening over Wastwater right away to the 
Irish Sea and the Isle of Man. Further round, the grand 
block of Scafell is close upon us, and, of course, contracts 
the scene ; but, looking to the north of his great head, we 
get a glimpse of Winandermere and the Yorkshire hills. 
There is a large cairn built at the summit, under which the 
traveller may shelter while he has his luncheon ; and, among 
the rocks close by, will be found a well, from which we may 
venture to promise he will get pure water. 

It is less than half-a-mile, along the ridge, in a north-east- 
erly direction, to the summit of ©reen ©aWe ; and we 
advise the descent in that direction. There are several piles 
of stones along the way, and it is a descent of 448 feet. 
Buttermere and Crummock have now come into view. 

Fiom this point it is possible to descend by the depres- 
sion on the north-east, leading steeply down to Seathwaite 
and Seatoller ; but it is better to go along the western side 
of the ridge for a mile and a half, passing over ^rantiretSf 



©^laramarra* 275 

and on as far as @reg JB?[.n0tt0, and then take advantage of 
the more gradual slope to Seatoller. 

Grey Knotts is 213 feet lower than Green Gable. Having 
arrived at the former, we continue forward, a little to the east 
of north, still keeping under the western ridge and avoiding 
the streamlets on the left-hand. The ground is roughish, 
but in little more than two-thirds of a mile we reach the 
;]lfe>;0nt0tEr ^ass road, and so easily down to Seatoller 
and Borrowdale. 



ASCENT OF GLARAMARRA. 

(Direct to the summit and back is 12 miles of road and 7 of hill work. — 
If the return is by Esk Hause, 4 additional miles of mountain). 

©latamarra is nearly due east of the Green Gable, which 
we have just been describing, and 60 feet higher than the 
latter. The Seathwaite Valley is between the two hills. 
It is not one of the most interesting ascents, as it is a good 
deal blocked in by surrounding heights, the only open- 
ing being in the direction of Borrowdale, and that can 
be at least equally well seen from Scafell and the Gables. 
It is ascended from ^ostj^lBiaite, and, if our tourist has not 
a guide with him, and does not know the ground, we advise 
him to get clear of some of the intricate turnings at the 
outset by employing one of the villagers to direct him 
to Comb Gill. He will pass a mill, some pretty water- 
falls, and then a sheepfold. From this point he must make 
a sharp turn to the west under Raven Crags, and then 
a steady climb of a mile and a half will bring him to the 
top. Here we find rough ground, extending southwards, 
with no great variation in the elevation, to .^Uan ©'rags 
and Esk Hause. 

T 2 



276 ^esliaicfe ^fstrict. 

The return journey may be either by Sprinkling and Sty 
Head Tarns (p. 269) or by Angle Tarn and the Longstrath 
Beck, by the side of which there is a path to Stonethwaite. 
(p. 269.) 



LORD'S SEAT AND BARF. 
(8 miles of road and 3^ of hill work). 

This is an excursion of moderate length, within the powers 
of most walkers, and, it is really a fine sight looking down 
from Barf, with Bassenthwaite stretched out at our feet. Skid- 
daw framing the picture on the opposite side, and seeming, 
in some lights, to be within a stone's throw. Further round 
to the right is Keswick, which looks well from here, and 
beyond, beautiful Derwentwater and its overshadowing moun- 
tains. 

The easist way of getting to the summit is to go to Portin- 
scale, forward through Braithwaite, and two miles further 
on the Lorton road, which brings us to the end of the Comb 
Plantation.^ Now take to the steep fell side on the right, 
and by the margin of the plantation. It is a stiff pull for a 
short distance and not good ground, but very shortly it be- 
comes easier, and then a mile and a half due north on the 
fell brings us to the summit of Sorb's ^eat 

From this place to ^arf is little more than half a mile 
due west. This hill is 275 feet lower than Lord's Seat. 

The return journey may be varied by crossing Comb Gill. 
Aim for the northern point of the Comb Plantation, and 
then down by the eastern side of it. This will bring you into 
Comb Gill and then to the village of Thomthwaite and the 
Bassenthwaite road, three miles and a half from Keswick. 

* It will be obvious that it is easy to drive or ride to this point and back. 



Kill Excurgion. 277 



GRANGE FELL. 
(Ten miles of road, and 3 of hill-work. ) 

We have hinted, at page 244, that the Fell between the 
Watendlath road and Borrowdale is interesting and has many 
fine points of view. A short day may be well spent in ex- 
ploring it. The ground is rough, and has many peaks to 
scramble up to ; but nothing could be finer than the views 
all round, which vary at every step. To the far north are 
Skiddaw and Bassenthwaite ; beneath, is Derwentwater. 
Westward, are the fine heights in the Buttermere direction ; 
and, to the south, charming Borrowdale with all its beautiful 
forms of water, wood, rock and hill, backed by our highest 
hills. 

Perhaps the most interesting walk is along the edge of the 
hill where it begins to descend steeply into Borrowdale, at 
a height of about 1000 feet, from whence the whole panorama 
can be surveyed. Active walkers will, of course, mount the 
inviting rocks which lie all around. 

The Fell is most easily reached by the Ashness and 
Watendlath road, above the Barrow Fall, keeping to the road 
until about half-a-mile off the tarn, and then mounting the fell 
on the right, after Caffell Crags have been passed. Those 
who do not object to a bit of steep climbing can go up at 
Lodore by the Waterfall. As regards the return journey; 
we have already directed attention to the path down to 
Rosthwaite : and there is the alternative, after going round 
the fell, of again getting into the Watendlath cart-road, and 
so gradually down to Barrow. 



27S ]Kei3t)fcfe ^fetrtct. 



ASCENT OF HIGH SEAT, AND BACK TO KESWICK 
BY THIRLMERE, 

(Nine and a-half miles of road, and three of hill-work. If Thirlmere 
be left out, i^ mile less of road.) 

High Seat will be found on the Map between I.odore 
and Thirlmere. It is the most conspicuous point (1996 feet) 
in that district, and consequently the summit affords most 
comprehensive and grand views in all directions. In reach- 
ing this, it is possible, perhaps, to save a few hundred yards 
by making ^ short cuts ' on the way ; but we very much ques- 
tion whether the pedestrian would be at his goal one minute 
sooner; therefore, we say take the way which cannot be 
mistaken, and that is the one going direct on the Watendlath 
road to Ashness Farm (page 243). Here the fell on the 
southern side of the stream must be attacked. It is steep 
for a short distance, but the walker will soon find himself 
on easier ground, and must keep on in a south-easterly direc- 
tion, with the stream on his left. From the farm to the sum- 
mit of ^Mtfifj MzBi is less than two miles, and, the fell being 
reached, there need be little or no divergence from the 
almost straight line of the beck which will be seen in the 
hollow. 

As we have said, there is a grand prospect from the top : 
Derwentwater, Bassenthwaite, Borrowdale, part of Thirlmere 
and all their majestic surroundings ; Helvellyn being con- 
spicuous eastward. 

A descent may be made due east to Thirlmere, and 
so along its western margin to Stonethwaite Bridge, as 
shown at the top of page 258; but, supposing that way has 
been traversed before, the best course is to descend only as 



Excursion* 279 

far as Stonethwaite Gill, and then follow the eastern side of 
the stream down to Stonethwaite Farm, which is about two 
miles. Here a path will be found conducting into the turn- 
pike road at a point three miles from Keswick (page 75.) 



ASCENT OF DALE HEAD. 

{By the Hojtister Road. — I2i miles of road and path ; 2\ miles of hill- 
work. By Grange. — 12 miles of road and path, and 3^^ of hill-work. 

Dale Head is a mountain between the southern end of 
Borrowdale and the Buttermere Valley. It is of consider- 
able height (2473 feet), and consequently commands good 
prospects east, west, and north, the great heights hemming 
it in southward. We recommend the walk very strongly as 
embracing every variety of scenery. 

There are two or three ways of ascending it, the easiest 
being by the Honister Pass road (page 245). On attaining 
the very summit of that road, just before descending to 
Honister Crag, the carriages or ponies must be dismissed, 
and the fell on the left ascended. It is little more than a 
mile from this point, steering due northwards, and the 
gradients are easy to the top of ©ale f^eati* 

The other way to get up is to take a cart-road at Grange 
village, by the western side of the Derwent. This must be 
followed for nearly two miles, when it terminates near Rigg- 
head Slate Quarries. The course of the streamlet must still 
be followed, and the top of the hill aimed for, which is 
directly before us and due westward. When about a-third 
of a mile has been traversed in that direction we arrive at a 
ridge, running at right angles ; at this point it is desirable to 
veer a little to the south and round the crags in front, which 



28o ^KegiBicfe ^Distxici 

do not look tempting ; then by holding to the right, under 
the crags and over another streamlet, the summit is easily 
reached. 

The beck which we crossed last runs down the Newlands 
Valley, and it is by this we will make our return journey. 
There is an old copper-mine northward, and very near the 
summit ; and beyond it, say a quarter of a mile altogether, 
will be found a track which has been used by the miners. 
This track, at first making zig-zags, leads by the beck and right 
down the glen, which is closely hemmed in by steep ground. 
In two miles the Goldscope Mine is reached, and then we 
are soon out into the fair valley of Newlands, on to Portin- 
scale, and home. 

It is, of course, easy to see that carriages or ponies can 
be used for a large portion of this excursion. If the ascent 
were by the Honister road, the descent might be down upon 
Grange, in which case the conveyance might be despatched 
firom the former to the latter place. 



ROUND DERWENTWATER BY LAND. 
(Ten miles. ) 

In one or other of the foregoing excursions, almost every 
part of the road round Derwentwater has been described. 
At page 237 we have spoken of the part by Barrow and 
Lodore to ©range. At that village we turn northward for 
the homeward journey, and at page 236, in the Catbells 
excursion, the western side of the lake is noticed. This 
latter portion of the drive is not so interesting as might be 
expected, the ordinary road being a good deal shut in by 
the woods through which it passes ; but if the tourist can 



mount to the roads which run almost parallel higher up the 
hill, he will be amply rewarded by the grand views obtained. 
It only remains to be said here that the drive round the lake 
is most popular ; and that a visit to the Bowder Stone is 
frequently made at the same time, which adds about a 
mile to the distance travelled. 



KESWICK TO WINDERMERE. 

(By Castlerigg, 21 miles. By the Vale of St. John, 23 miles). 

This main thoroughfare of the district has been fully de- 
scribed, reverse way, at page 71. There are two roads from 
Keswick : the one, generally taken by the coaches, by ^agtle* 
xiQQ ; the other by the Vale of St. John.* In the first, the 
road passes St. John's Church and then ascends a steep hill, 
from the top of which there is a grand view looking back over 
Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite, Skiddaw, the monarch of 
the scene, rising above the latter. From this point to the 
King's Head Inn, at Thirlspot, where the road by the Vale 

4% of St. John is joined, there is nothing calling for special 
notice. 

The road now passes under the Helvellyn range on the 

8M left, with ^E^fjtrltnete on the right, until "l^iSTstpurn is 
reached. From this place there is a gradual ascent to 3itin« 

g% mail Sfilaise, at the top of which pass, the traveller enters 
Westmorland, and, soon afterwards, the vale of ©rasmete^ 
In the descent. Helm Crag is seen to the right, with the con- 
spicuous rocks on its summit which go by the names of the 

12 Lion and the Lamb. Grasmere lake is next passed on 

13 the right, then ^^tial "ySSfater, while, on the left is Nab 

* For the latter, see page 256. 



282 ^esbJicfe ^fetrtct 

Scar. Just above the little church of Rydal, may be seen 
the roof of Wordsworth's house. Then a glimpse of Rydal 
Hall is caught through the trees, the traveller having on his 
right the river Rothay, with Loughrigg above. After another 
mile, .^^milmXiz, appears, and, afterwards "J^f inantiermere 
begins to open out ; by the side of which lake the road 
continues for some distance. From the Lowwood Hotel, 
the view across the lake into the Langdale Valley should be 
noticed ; then, when three miles more (out of the twenty-one 
of the most picturesque coach-road in England), have been 
accomplished, Windermere is reached. 



The Pedestrian can make his way to Windermere by 
several other routes. He may cross the fells from Watend- 
lath to Armboth on Thirlmere, and join the coach-road at 
the foot of Dunmail Raise, or, he can, by commencing at the 
same point, make his way over to Grasmere by Blea Tarn. 
Or, he can start with the fells at Rosthwaite, and follow the 
Stake Pass to the head of Langdale. The last route we 
shall notice in detail ; but, for the other two, the particulars 
given in the preceding pages will suffice. 



KESWICK TO LANGDALE BY THE STAKE PASS. 
(12 miles of road and path, and 2^ of hill-work.) 

In this route the road to^otrob^tiale as far as ^ogtl^biaite 
is followed, described at page 257. After passing through 
Rosthwaite, and proceeding three-quarters of a mile on 
the main road, the turn on the left must be taken, which 



'^xcnxmn. 283 

leads by the east side of the church to the hamlet of j^tone* 
tj^hiaite. In another mile, the stream, which is the infant 
Derwerlt, finding its way down from Angle Tarn, must be 
crossed by a bridge to the eastern side ; there is no climbing 
however, for two more miles, and then the work begins at a 
point where the beck divides right and left. We cross the 
left branch by ford or bridge, and then wind up the hill 
for about a mile, when the summit (1575 feet) is reached. 
We now have the great mass of pSobifell right in front ; but 
our path leads us round to the west, and, after a few hun- 
dred yards of moorland, we come upon the descent on the 
^angtiale side, with Pike o' Stickle at the other side of the 
valley. The steep part of the descent is not more than a 
mile, and then in two miles Wnn^zon ffiill Hotel is reached. 
See page S6. 



KESWICK TO ENNERDALE, CALDER ABBEY, AND 
WASTWATER, BY ROAD OR RAILWAY. 

We will first shortly point out the way by carriage road, 
which is a day's journey of about 40 miles.* If both 
Ennerdale and the Abbey are visited on the way, we advise 
all but the most robust to lodge at Calder Bridge Inn the 
first night, and, next morning, go on to Wastwater. In any 
case, beds must be secured beforehand, either at Calder 
Bridge, Strands, or Wastdale Head. The first is by far 
the best house. 

The way, as far as Scale Hill, is exactly the same as de- 
scribed in reverse at page 252-3; that is, through Portin- 
scale, Braithwaite, over Lorton Fell, then by Swinside and 

* The different objects on the way will be fully described in the 
next District, viz., Buttermere. 



284 ^0S$)3icIt ;]©fetrict 

Hopebeck farms to the ^rale ^Kill inn. If the traveller has 
not been here before, he will walk as far as the Station in 
Lanthwaite Wood, and see the grand view of Crummock 
Water and Buttermere, mentioned at page 252. This being 
done, and the horses a little rested, we turn round upon 
^E£0irie0lrrater, which is reached in a mile. Mellbreak, Little 
Dodd, and Carling Knott, especially the last, (the form of 
which is peculiarly conical for a lake-hill), stand out boldly at 
the eastern end of the lake. The drive of a mile along the 
margin of the lake is pleasant ; but, at the end of that there 
is a dearth of good scenery until the village named Ennerdale 
Bridge is reached, where the opening in which the lake lies, 
reveals the mountains on each side. From this village it is a 
mile and a-half to the Angler's Inn, at the north-western point 
of 3S.ttnertiale "^iZSfater, This lake will be described in the 
Buttermere District ; the tourist, who is now only taking a 
rapid survey, not being able to do much more than walk 
along the north-western end, and then it will be time to move 
in the direction of Calder Bridge. He will have to return 
to Ennerdale Bridge, and then, having again left the hills, 
proceed in a south-westerly direction, through the small 
town of Egremont, where everything is red with iron ore, 
and so on to our destination. There will be time to walk 
along the pretty stream and survey the ,M^hhti^ by evening 
light after dinner. In the morning we shall be fresh for 
"SZSTastinater, which will be reached in good time, so as to 
drive up to the head of the lake, and see the grand heights 
by which it is enclosed. 

If fresh horses be taken at Calder Bridge to go to Wast- 
water and back, it would be possible to get home again to 
Keswick on the evening of the second day. 



E.xcur0ion» 285 

It is not necessary to say much about the railway journey. 
The map shows that it is a wide circuit by Bassenthwaite, 
Cockermouth, Matron Junction (or Workington, according 
to the time tables) and, southward, to Seascale, where a car 
will be taken for the remaining 10 miles to the head of 
Wastdale. The return drive would be by ©'alter M^h^z^, 
and, if Snttertiale ^afee be visited, it would be well to stay 
at the Seascale Inn all night, and take rail to Frizington 
station, which is five miles from Ennerdale, in the morning. 



KESWICK TO ULLSWATER. 

There are three recognised ways of reaching UUswater 
from Keswick. We will give them separately : — 

I. — ©ribing by carriage-road, via Threlkeld ; crossing the 
railway at ^E^routbecfe* Station ; under the western side of 
Mill Fell; Matterdale and Docwray villages; and then down 
upon the lake at the western end of Gowbarrow Park. The 
first part of the road, as far as Threlkeld, has been abun- 
dantly described (p. 256). After this it becomes wild and 
bleak, though commanding noble distant views of the Keswick 
mountains and of the saddle-shaped Old Blencathra. Mell 
Fell, — the ugliest of hills, like a tumulus planted all over 
with larch, — grows larger as the traveller proceeds, till he 
finds he is to make a sharp turn to the right, and pass directly 
under it. Judging from our own experience, we should say 
that this part of the journey is always broiling hot or bitter 
cold. A bleak high-lying track it certainly is, where the old 
monks no doubt suffered much and often in their expeditions. 
The paternoster said among the perils of UUswater, and 
the Ave Maria here, are supposed by some to have given 
* Not to be mistaken for the Troutbeck, near Windermere. 



2 86 ^esbJirft ;E)fetrict 

the names of Patterdale and Matterdale, which become 
more interesting as soon as their origin is known. From 
Matterdale the road drops down upon Gowbarrow Park, 
described in the Patterdale Section. It is a usual practice 
to send on the carriage to one of the inns, (weather permit- 
ting), when the driver will order dinner to be ready in two 
hours or so : and then the traveller will explore the park, 
and see ..^ta ^orce, and walk the remaining three or four 
miles, — enjoying on his way, the very finest views of Ulls- 
water. 

TI. — ^aitoag anti ^oac^. The only difference from 
the foregoing account is that the railway is taken for the 
first nine miles to Troutbeck Station, where coaches for 
Patterdale meet the trains. As these arrangements are 
sometimes altered, it will be well to consult the time-tables 
for the current month. 

(8i miles of road and 3 of hill-work.) 
III. — By ^tg ^um, which is the northern shoulder of 
Helvellyn. Any of the coachmen on the Windermere and 
Keswick road will put passengers down at the exact spot 
from whence the ascent of the Pass should be commenced. 
It is a few hundred yards beyond the southern end of St. 
John's Vale at a farm called Stanah. The path goes through 
the farm-yard and then passes to high-ground on the southern 
side of the beck, when steep zig-zags at once commence. 
It is well defined, being used by the miners who live at 
Keswick, or in the cottages at the western side of the 
mountain, and the direction is almost due east. In two 
miles and a-half the ridge is reached, at an elevation of 
about 2,300 feet. The descent is by the northern side of

below, after which the miner's road must be followed down 
the Glenridding Valley direct to the new hotel. 

This last is the shortest way to Ullswater. We cannot 
say that any one of them, taken altogether, is particularly in- 
teresting. The prospect is fine coming down Gowbarrow 
Park to the lake, and the same may be said of the descent 
from Greenside lead mines, but the former portions of both 
roads are singularly uninteresting as compared with others in 
the district.

Since the re-building of one of the Inns at Buttermere, 
/and the renovation and enlargement of the other, the 
village has become a more desirable place of sojourn for 
a few days than either Strands or Wastdale Head, the inn 
accommodation at the latter being of a third-rate character. 
Besides, Buttermere is surrounded by many of the highest 
hills in the district, and consequently those whose object is 
mountaineering, will economise time by making this their 
head-quarters. Carriage-folk will find a good many drives, 
;^and pedestrians a variety of walks, which have hitherto re- 
.' ceived little or no attention in guide-books. For the artist 
we hold this station to be better than any other in the 

U 2 



292 iSuttermere ^fetrici 

district, — more ' material ' in a small area. The hills 
are dose, rocky, and at every turn give fresh combinations 
which shape well for pictures. 

We have elsewhere (page 250) described some of the 
characteristics of the scenery ; but, besides the rugged hills 
and storm there alluded to, Buttermere and Crummock have 
charming patches of green meadow, running close up to the 
bare and precipitous rocks, which by contrast make the 
hills more beautiful and imposing than elsewhere. De 
Quincey says, 'the margin of the lake, which is over- 
hung by some of the loftiest and steepest of the Cumbrian 
mountains, exhibits on either side few traces of human 
neighbourhood ; the level area, where the hills recede enough 
to allow of any, is of a wild pastoral character, or almost 
savage. The waters of the lake are deep and sullen, and 
the barrier mountains, by excluding the sun for much of his 
daily course, strengthen the gloomy impressions. At the 
foot of this lake lie a few unornamented fields, through 
which rolls a little brook, connecting it with the larger lake 
of Crummock, and, at the edge of this miniature domain, 
upon the road-side, stands a cluster of cottages, so small 
and few, that in the richer tracts of the island they would 
scarcely be complimented with the name of hamlet.* But, 
since De Quincey's time there have been a good many 
changes : a neat little church and school have been built f 
and, besides the hotels, several new dwellings have sprung up, 

* The old church was supposed by many to be the smallest in Eng- 
land. It was rebuilt in 1840, and is still very diminutive. The old 
church or chapel stood upon the same site, and was of great antiquity. 
It may be interesting to some to pay a visit to the little school, which is 
carried on by subscription and maintained wkh difficulty. Boxes are 
placed in the hotel to receive contributions from the visitors who desire 
to help the little people of the dale in acquiring the rudiments of learn- 
ing, — a task apparently much more difficult to them than climbing the 
giddy heights of their native mountains. 



^uttermere. 293 

notably a parsonage, which altogether form a community fully 
entitled to the name of village. To this may be added, that 
agriculture has improved the meadows and slopes, and, 
what is very important, the principal roads are good and 
well kept, except in places where the excessive steepness 
suggests looseness of surface to check the wheels. 

Butter Mere is rather more than a mile and a quarter long ; 
its broadest part is half-a-mile across ; and, its greatest 
depth, 90 feet. The water contains trout and char, the lat- 
ter, however, are not so abundant as they are in Crummock. 
Boats may be had at the inns, and good ^Rfeljin^ in the lakes 
is promised to those who enjoy the sport. The streams are 
also well-stocked with fish, which cannot be said of those in 
the district generally. For, notwithstanding the large quan- 
tity of water, it is a notorious fact that fish is often im- 
ported for residents and tourists. This, however, does 
not apply to our present head-quarters : the veritable char 
will be placed before the guest, for which, in London, 
as much as los. a pound is sometimes paid. While our 
travelling companion is being regaled with this delicacy 
at a very moderate cost, we may tell the story of the 
' Beauty of Buttermere, ' which every one who comes here 
ought to know, in the words of Mr. Payn. 

*The course of true love, even after marriage, has not 
always run smoothly, even at pastoral Buttermere. Every- 
body has heard of poor Mary of that Ilk : a little tract about 
her was once published, and ^ Mary of Buttermere'^ had, in 
its day, though among a different class, almost as great a 
circulation as " The Dairyman! s Daughter ; and, the story, 
now long forgotten, may have some interest for the present 
generation. An individual calling himself the Hon. Colonel 
Hope, visited the Cumberland Lakes in August, 1802, and 



294 ;©uttetmete ^tstrtct. 

took up his abode at the house of one Robinson, the father 
of Mary, who kept a small ale-house at the foot of the lake. 
This gentleman arrived in his own carriage, though without 
servants, and seemed to have been possessed of a distin- 
guished appearance albeit he was forty-five years of age. 
Titles are as attractive to the Fair in the recesses of Cum- 
berland as in that fashionable district which the vulgar will 
persist in calling Pimlico ; and the courtship of poor Mary 

— the reports of whose beauty, and not the charms 
of natural scenery, had attracted the gallant Colonel — 
ended in marriage on the second day of October. A pair 
of gloves — it is not stated whether they were new or cleaned 

— was the only wedding present he made her. Some doubts 
of his identity — and what was more, of the genuineness of 
his cheques — having arisen in Keswick, he drove over there 
with four horses, confronted his accusers, and while they 
were procuring a warrant for his apprehension, went a fishing 
in Derwentwater. The Keswick folks, among whom visitors 
of quality were much rarer at that time than now-a-days, 
stuck to their Honourable Colonel and were persuaded, says 
the chronicler " that, if he was not this great man, would 
prove to be some other great man ; " but he was not this 
great man, and, instead of fishing, landed at Lodore, whence, 
late as it was, he mad-e his way in the dark " across that 
fearful Alpine pass, the Stake," into Langdale. He was 
apprehended in December, at Brecknock, in Wales, on the 
charge of bigamy, and put upon his trial the ensuing August 
at Carlisle for forging certain bills of exchange, and frank- 
ing letters in the name of Colonel Hope, M.P., for which 
he was condemned to death. But the public interest was 
centred in the fact of his bigamy, which was incontestably 
established. On the 31st of August, he was hung; the 
"noose slipping twice, on account of his great weight, so 



TiZSTalfe. 295 

that he fell down above 100 inches." A still-born child v.as 
the fruit of this illegal marriage with poor Mary, who should 
have been styled rather the Grace of Buttermere than the 
the Beauty, since, although exquisitely proportioned, " she 
was gap-toothed and a little pock-marked." However, if 
not so deserving of admiration as she has been described, 
she was entitled to much pity ; for the scoundrel who be- 
trayed her, had also swindled her father out of a hundred 
and eighty pounds, — almost all that he possessed. 

Think of the poor, deserted, distracted girl thus rudely 
widowed, and deprived even of the solace of considering 
herself a member of the British Aristocracy I I don't know 
whether 1 ought to add that she married again, and turned 
out (it is whispered) to be a bit of a termagant. Maids and 
even wives are fit and proper subjects for romance : but 
somehow, when one thinks of second wives, the mind reverts 
with a flash to Mr. Samuel Weller, senior, and his domestic 
circumstances.' 



For those who cannot climb the various mountains, or 
who desire to have a variety of scenery without undergoing; 
fatigue, there are several short walks which afford o:- 
quisite views of Buttermere and Crummock Lakes and the 
surrounding mountains. 



RANNERDALE KNOTT. 
(4 miles). 
The moderate elevation locally called The ^KLnottS is 
reached by passing the Parsonage and turning to the right 



296 ^uttcrmete district, 

at the back of the cottages a few yards beyond. After a 
short climb, Buttermere and half of Crummock Lake come 
in sight, with the village nestling in the remarkably pictur- 
esque foreground as if for mutual companionship. Those 
who wish to prolong the walk should mount in a northerly 
direction (avoiding the beck on the right) until a sheepfold 
comes in sight, which is about 700 feet above the lake ; now 
turn to the left along or by the side of the ridge, and, in a 
little more than half-a.mile of roughish walking, the summit 
of ^annettiale ^ELnott will be reached, where there is a 
really grand and complete view of the three lakes and their 
gigantic surroundings. Indeed, we know few points in the 
district, so easily reached, and which so well rewards the 
climber, not excluding the Station at Scale Hill, or the visit 
to Scale Force. The whole distance from the inn and back 
is under four miles. 



HONISTER SLATE QUARRIES. 
(9 miles.) • 

At page 246, we have given an account of these interest- 
ing excavations. While staying at Buttermere, it is but a 
moderate walk to visit them, and witness the way in which 
the quarrymen split up the blocks of stone into the thin 
slate which covers our houses. Besides this, however, the 
ascent of the Crag is most interesting. 

About 200 yards beyond ©atesgaxt]^ Farm, a rough cart- 
road turns off on the right, which leads along the base of the 
mountain and then by Warnscale Beck. After a mile of this 
the ascent begins, and for a short distance, there is a sharp 
pull ; but by ingenious windings and zig-zags the summit is 



"SZ5S"aHtg. 297 

easily gained, from whence there is still a rough cart or sledge 
track to the quarries. It is best to go on this track right 
across the common (avoiding the first turn to the left) and 
get to the excavations at the verge of the precipice and the 
wonderful sledge-path down it. Very good walkers can go 
on a little further and get down Bull Gill into the Honister 
road j but those not so sure-footed will proceed further until 
descent is easy between the streamlets which run towards 
the top of the Hause. The journey home will thus be as 
described at page 247. 



SCARTH GAP. 
(Smiles.) 

This forms part of the Wastdale Head excursion ; but it 
may be as well to point out to those who do not undertake 
the whole of the tour that to the top of the Gap and back 
forms a most interesting and very beautiful walk of eight 
miles. 

The way is by the main road towards Honister Pass, and, 
on arriving at ©ateggattlj Farm, turn in at the gate leading 
to the house ; cross the little bridge into the farm-yard , then 
through a field to the right ; and, after crossing the stream, 
the steep zig-zags commence. A short distance from where 
the climb begins, the track turns to the left, a gate is passed 
through, and it becomes very rugged and stony. The views 
from the top on a fine day are magnificent, Buttermere, sur- 
rounded by some of the loftiest mountains in the district, 
lying beneath. By dropping a little way down on the other 
side of the Gap, the entire stretch of the Ennerdale valley, 
its lake, and the far-off Irish Sea come into view, while close 



298 ^DButtermeu district 

about us are the Pillar, High Crag; Brandreth, and Kirk Fell. 
From here the traveller will return to his inn, highly pleased 
with his eight-mile walk ; in doing which, for variety's sake, 
the path on the west side of the lake may be taken, turning 
to the left at the foot of the hill instead of crossing the 
stream. 



HARTLEY HILL 

Is a grassy knoll, much frequented by artists, from whence 
they look up Buttermere towards Honister Crag and Scarth 
Gap passes, and, indeed, have the whole of the lake and its 
bold frame-work within the compass of one picture. To the 
right is ^outmilft ©ill, coming very steeply down from 
Bleaberry Tarn, under Red Pike, which in itself, in moist 
weather (not unfrequently happening here) is very imposing. 
The stream is broken into white foam from which the water- 
fall takes its name, and makes a tremendous noise, when 
the beck is full, as it leaps 900 feet from rock to rock. Fur- 
ther round we get a glimpse of Crummock Water and the 
picturesque village. 

This knoll is reached by passing through the farm-yard 
below the church ; and we advise the visitor to stray there 
during some spare half-hour. 



MILL BECK. 

(2 miles). 

A short and pleasant walk may be taken as follows. Pass 

the church and turn to the left up Buttermere Hause. 

After going a short distance, a little gate will be seen on the 

left leading into a field, at the bottom of which is the stream 



Ta^alfts* 299 

called Mill Beck. The woods skirting the banks will be- 
found shady and pleasant, and the wanderer may find that 
ferns are abundant. He may then cross a little wooden 
bridge a little higher up the stream, and climb the steep 
bank opposite, slanting to the left. At the top there is a 
gate in the wall leading on to the fell : the path to the left 
will lead to the ^Knotts as before described, from whence 
he may easily find the hotel. 



UNDER RANNERDALE KNOTT. 
(Three miles. ) 

About three-quarters of a mile from the village, in the 
direction of Crummock Water, the main road begins to run 
along the shore of the lake. At this point an old grassy 
cart-road will be found diverging to higher ground on the 
right. This grassy track was formerly the main road, and 
must have sorely taxed the strength of the horses ; it has, 
however, the advantage of commanding finer views of the 
lake than the present one, and that is what the visitor now 
comes for. In about three-quarters of a mile it again joins 
the carriage road at Hause Point. 



SCALE FORCE. 
(4 miles, there and back. ) 

This fall is almost invariably visited by the numerous 
tourists who make a day's excursion to Buttermere from 
Keswick. We have therefore described it at page 248, 
to which we refer the sojourner at our present head- 



300 ^uttertnere ^fetrtct 

quarters. It may, however, be added for those who go 
without a guide that, on leaving the village, the road on 
the left side of the Fish Inn is to be taken. After cross- 
ing the bridge, turn to the right and follow the path under 
Red Pike. When opposite Scale Island, the path may 
be left and a sheepfold, a few hundred yards up the hill- 
side, aimed for. From that the hollow in which the Scale 
stream runs is visible, and, having reached that, the fall 
will be easily found a little further up. This is consider- 
ably shorter than going round by the mouth of the beck 
where the boats usually deliver their loads; and at least 
quite as easy walking. 



BUTTEEMERE AND CRUMMOCK WATER. 

The equipment for boating at Buttermere and Crummock 
is not so luxurious as at the more frequented lakes : the 
downy cushions, shady awning, and sprucely-rigged yacht 
are not there : the tourist must be content with a substantial, 
roomy, safe boat, which accords with the primitive hills 
around. He will get fishing-tackle, and, if needful, a boat- 
man, at the inn, and then set off for a survey from the bosom 
of the water, buttermere will probably be the first attrac- 
tion. The boat-landing is reached by crossing the meadows 
and then by the beck towards the north-western point of the 
water. The eastern shore is occupied by a mountain called 
Robinson (2417 feet), the two roads to Keswick being in 
the depressions on each side of him ; then comes Honister 
Crag (2 1 26' feet), closing in the south-eastern end of the 
lake. To view the range on the north-east, we must row 
towards the point and the bay under Hassness, from whence 



"ySSTalftg* 301 

we have High Crag (2443), High Stile (2643), ^^^ Red Pike 
(2469), in all making the finest amphitheatre in lakeland. 

(STrummock "^^aizx is approached by a path commenc- 
ing on the right side of the Fish Inn. This lake is two miles 
and a-half long, and five-eighths of a mile at its widest points. 
It is closely hemmed in by mountains east and west, Mell- 
break (1676) rising very steeply and occupying nearly the 
whole of the western shore. The Vale of Newlands opens 
northward in the direction of Cockermouth, and then, further 
round to the right, conical Grasmoor (2791) abruptly rears his 
mighty head. Then comes Whiteless Pike (2159), and un- 
der it, craggy Rannerdale Knott. Crummock Water has four 
islands, two of which, called Woodhouse, are bare rocks ; 
the other two are larger and prettily wooded, but too near 
the south-eastern shore to add much to the general pictur- 
esque beauty of the lake. Rowing from end to end on a 
fine day is a charming excursion. The boat may be left at 
the northern point for luncheon at the Scale Hill Hotel ; and 
a visit to the Station in Lanthwaite Wood will be found a 
pleasing variety. 



ROUND BUTTERMERE BY LAND. 
(4 miles and a-half.) 

In the more frequented places of the Lake District this 
walk would be lionized. Under present circumstances the 
path is not much used and consequently it is in a bad state 
of repair ; but to those who wear strong boots and are other- 
wise prepared for a roughish walk, we say go round Butter- 
mere. As for the scenery, no better can be found. 

The path commences on the left side of the Fish Hotel. 
After two fields, the beck which connects the lakes must 



302 ^uttermete 'district 

be crossed, and then the turn to the left taken. We 
are now immediately under Red Pike, which rises very 
steeply on the right. The foot of Sourmilk Gill and Burt- 
ness Wood will be reached in about a third of a mile. 
Shortly after entering the latter, where the path forks, the 
right-hand one must be taken. The mountain called 
Robinson is the conspicuous object on the other side of the 
lake ; while, on looking back from the higher ground in the 
wood, pretty peeps of Crummock Water may be had. In 
about two miles from the inn, we reach the head of the lake 
and the foot of Scarth Gap Pass ; at this point, the beck must 
be crossed towards Gatesgarth Farm, where we reach the main 
road and turn to the left towards home by pretty Hassness. 



WALK ROUND CRUMMOCK AND LOWES WATERS. 
(13 miles). 

As we have said, there is a good carriage-road on the 
eastern side of ©TTummocft "y^S^Tater. On the opposite 
shore, there is a distinct path two-thirds of the way, and 
then the walker must be content with picking his way by 
the shore until a small farm called Peel is reached at the 
point where the lake begins to narrow. 

From this farm there are two roads, — one in the direc- 
tion of Scale Hill, (a mile distant), which will be taken by 
those for whom a nine-mile walk is enough : they will refresh 
themselves at the hotel, and then return home by the west- 
ern side of the lake. But we propose to take our more hardy 
pedestrian round ^obieiS "^^^M'attx, which will add rather 
more than four miles to the excursion. To do this, we turn 
westward at Peel Farm and in little short of a mile reach the 



'M.xtmmxt. 303 

village church, close by which there is the inevitable country- 
ale-house, which will afford plain refreshment. This hamlet 
is perched in a charming spot, commanding the best views up 
Crummock Water and away to Great Gable. The road on 
the western side of the church must be taken, and then, in 
about a quarter of a mile, a sharp turn to the left, which 
leads to the margin of Lowes Water and immediately under 
the precipitous Ratlins ^E^LnottS (1781) which is beautifully 
wooded down to the margin of the lake. This wood extends 
nearly the length of the lake (only a mile) and the cart-road 
we have to traverse, which is mainly used for the convey- 
ance of the timber, is not in the best repair ; nor is the 
view in front of the finest order ; but soon we get turned 
the corner at Waterend * and reach a good carriage-drive 
with the remarkable mountain-group of Carling Knott, Little 
Dodd, and Mellbreak, close upon the opposite shore, and 
gigantic Grasmoor in the distance. It is two miles and a 
half hence to ^cale !Ktll Hotel. 

This will be the best opportunity for visiting the ^tatkin, 
an elevated spot in Lanthwaite Wood, whence a magnificent 
view is obtained (page 252.) 

After a rest on the rocks and in the shady paths of this 
wood, we cheerfully wend our way home under Grasmoor, 
commanding grand views of the lake nearly the whole way. 



EXCURSION TO WASTWATER, SCAFELL, CALDER 
ABBEY, EGREMONT, AND ENNERDALE. 
(45 miles. If Great Gable be included, 2 miles more). 
The pedestrian who has secured comfortable quarters at 

* There is a foot-track from here over the shoulder of Blake Fell, 
and by Floutern Tarn to Ennerdale, presently to be mentioned. 



304 'JExtnxmn, 

Buttermere soon thinks of visiting Wastwater, which is a 
short day's work, with homely and clean entertainment at 
the half-way house ; it is, indeed, the most popular walk from 
here, and those who can scale the two passes will certainly 
take it. The more hardy walker will most likely (and we 
strongly advise it) incorporate with it the ascent of Scafell ; 
others will extend it to the grand excursion round by Strands, 
Calder Abbey, and Ennerdale, which can be * done ' in two 
days by some, while others may accomplish it in that time 
with the assistance of a carnage from Wastdale Head to the 
inn at Ennerdale. It is this last tour which we now propose 
to describe. Those who take the shorter will have no diffi- 
culty in finding their way home by a reference to preceding 
pages. 

As nearly as we can make out, the walk from Buttermere 
to Wastdale Head is nine miles ; most of it must be traversed 
on foot, though a pony may be led and occasionally moun- 
ted. The first piece of work is to ascend ^cart]^ ©ap, as 
at page 297, and then there is a descent of half a mile, 
to where the path joins that coming up from Ennerdale. 
From this junction our direction is on the slope of the 
hill, almost parallel with and towards the source of the 
infant (sometimes brawling) Liza, which falls from here into 
the lake. A sheep-fold marks the spot where the stream is 
to be crossed. Here •the pillar is the monarch of the 
scene — 2,893 feet high, and nearly inaccessible from its 
craggy and precipitous character. 

* It wears the shape 
Of a vast building made of many crags ; 
And in the midst is one particular rock 
That rises like a column from the vale, — 
Whence by our shepherds it is called the Pillar.' 

It is not, however, the mountain itself which is difficult of 



^xzni ^aWe. 305 

ascent, but the * particular rock ' on its western side, which 
some few, it is said, have accompHshed.* Great Gable and 
Kirkfell close in the dale at its head: behind are High 
Stile and Red Pike, and Gillerthwaite is below, with its 
circular green level, dropped over with trees, its farm-house 
and stream, and the lake at the other end. 

Having crossed the beck, the track continues for a third 
of a mile by the western side of Sail Beck, a small tributary 
of the Liza which points southward. There is a mountain 
ash on the way at some height above, which must be 
reached. It is here that care is required as regards the path ; 
however, if the beck and its waterfalls, be kept on the left 
until you have zig-zagged among the crags for another half 
mile, at the end of which is a bolder mass of rock than the 
rest, a successful ascent can hardly fail to be accomplished. 
Above the said rock, the path turns sharply to the right and 



* Those who wish to ascend Scafell and take Green Gable and 
Great Gable on the way, must no^ cross the beck, but continue in 
an almost due south-easterly course by its side. In a very short distance 
(quarter of a mile) a tributary called Lot's Beck will have to be forded ; 
the principal stream must still, however, be kept as a guide and com- 
panion on the right-hand, all the way to its source, and then there 
will be no difficulty, weather permitting, in reaching the summit of 
Windy Gap, (which is the depression between the Great and the Green 
Gables) in something under two miles from the sheep-fold. On arriv- 
ing there, we have the former on our right and the latter on our left. 
At page 274, we have alluded to these two important hills and 
described the views they command. The pedestrian will most probably 
ascend the former, — the lion-hill of the district, and wonder, if the 
elements have been favourable, how easily he has got up. Our next 
work is to reach Styhead Tarn, which is visible on the eastern side, 
the general direction being as before, — almost due south-east on the slope 
of Great Gable. The distance between these two points is a mile and 
a quarter. Having reached the tarn, full instructions for completing 

V

away from the beck, the zig-zagging still continuing for a 
third of a mile, when the summit of ^lacfe M^il iJ^agg 
is reached at an elevation of 1800 feet. 

Gatherstone Beck takes its rise just at the other side of 
the ridge, and the track zig-zags near to it in the direction 
of XSlosetJale ' yi alleg, which latter we hope the traveller 
sees below. In something less than a mile, the beck is to be 
crossed to its eastern side, where, for a short distance, the 
ground is steep. After this, a mile or so of comparatively level 
valley brings us to the clump of houses forming the ham- 
let of ~^^SFa0tt»ale Keati. 

Several gentlemen have spent weeks together at Ritson's, 
at the dale head, where there are clean beds, and farmhouse 
fare in plenty and perfection. There is now a little inn 

the ascent of Scafell will be found at page 272, while further par- 
ticulars about the descent are given further on. 

Those who do not wish to ascend the Gables can somewhat shorten 
the way to Scafell by aiming for Beckhead Tarn, which is in the depres- 
sion between Great Gable and Kirkfell. To make this intelligible, we 
will suppose ourselves again at the Scarth Gap crossing-place of the 
Liza, with the sheep-fold on the opposite bank. The stream is no^ to 
be crossed, — we continue along the north-eastern side of it, shortly 
cross the branch called Loft Beck, and, in about three-quarters of a mile 
from the sheep-fold, reach a point where there is another junction of 
streams. JVow^the main stream must be forded, and our pedestrian 
must follow the further branch which leads him almost due south. He 
will avoid Kirkfell Crags on the right and aim for the depression be- 
low them, when (in half a-mile) he will find Beckhead Tarn. From 
hence the course is under the rocks of Great Gable at an elevation of 
about 2000 feet. It is desirable to keep as near the rocks as is found 
convenient, so as to reach the Styhead Pass path as high up as pos- 
sible. Now we are on the slope of Lingmell and also on the general 
route from Wastdale, by Peers Gill, to the summit of Scafell Pike, 
which is fully described further on in this excursion.

kept by one of the Ritsons, the other family having 
still accommodation for private lodgers. The opening 
out of the dale head, when the valley has appeared to close 
in round the lake, is as wonderful a spectacle to strangers 
as anything they see. The dale is one of those perfect 
levels, shut in by lake and mountains, which give a different 
impression from any other kind of scenery in the world. 
The passes themselves are so high as to leave no appearance 
of outlet, except by the lake ; and of these passes there are 
but two, — the Styhead and the Mosedale paths. The 
green and perfect level, to which the mountains come down 
with a sheer sweep, is partly divided off into fields ; and a 
few farmhouses are set down among the fields, on the bends 
of the gushing and gurgling stream. There is a chapel, — 
the humblest of chapels, — with eight pews, and three win- 
dows in three sides, and a skylight over the pulpit. There 
is also a school. The schoolmaster is entertained on 'whittle- 
gate ' terms ; that is, boards at the farmhouses in turn. An 
old man told us that the plan answers. ' He gets on very 
well,' said he, ' and particularly in the spelling. He thinks 
if they can spell, they can do the rest.' Such are the origi- 
nal conclusions arrived at in Wastdale Head. It struck us 
that the children were dirtier than even in other vales, 
though the houses are so clean that you might eat your 
dinner off the board or the floor. But the state of the 
children's skin and hair is owing to superstition in all these 
dales; and the schoolmaster is the one who should cure the 
evil. A young lady who kindly undertook to wash and 
dress the infant of a sick woman, but who was not ex- 
perienced in the process, exclaimed at the end, ' O dear ! I 
forget its hands and arms. I must wash them.' The mother 
expressed great horror, and said that * if the child's arms 
were washed before it was six months old, it would be a 

V 2 



3o8 ^uttertncte district, 

thief; ' and, she added, pathetically, ^ I would not like that' 
The hair and nails must not be cut for a much longer time, 
for fear of a like result. The Yorkshire people put the 
alternative of dirty and clean rather strongly in their pro- 
verb, * Better hev a barn wi' a mucky feace than wash its 
noase off : ' but the Cumberland folk view the matter more 
in a moral way, and refuse to have their children baptized 
into thievery. 

Besides ascending Scafell from Wastdale, the tourist will 
be glad to know of the shorter walks which may be taken. 
That to the waterfalls on the north side of Lingmell is 
perhaps the most important, ^eers ©ill is a very long 
and deep ravine under Great End; and the other, ©irla 
^orce, a lofty waterfall. This latter is formed of two 
sister falls, each considerably higher, and having a much 
larger body of water in it, than Scale Force : but not perhaps 
falling quite so sheer. A narrow tongue of land divides 
their leaps ; but the two streams meet together in a chasm 
below which would itself be considered fine were not 
Peers Gill so near a neighbour. There is here no female 
guide who is to be satisfied with a shilling — no steps cut 
in the rock, — no little gateway closed to the solitary 
adventurer. On the other hand it is proper to state that 
two streams have to be crossed before a good view of Girla 
Force can be obtained ; ladies therefore should choose dry 
weather, when the passage is easy enough, for this expedition. 
Starting from Ritson's, we take the oM road towards Styhead 
down in the valley; cross the stream where it is most con- 
venient, and steer for the junction of Peers Gill and Girla 
Force. We cross here to the left bank of the latter, and 
ascending it to the point opposite the foot of the tongue, 
get to the summit, not without a little difficulty, and are 



TM'asttiale. 309 

rewarded not only with a good view of the falls (which in- 
deed can be seen even better from below) but with a fine 
sight of all the Wastdale amphitheatre. Descending to the 
junction of the streams where we crossed before, if it be 
tolerably dry weather, we clamber up the bed of Peers Gill, 
hemmed in by the grandest natural wall on either side, and 
by the terrible precipices of Scafell immediately in front : 
behind. Great Gable closes the scene with its stupendous 
pyramid. This is by far the finest ravine in the Lake 
Country for real grandeur : the few mountain ashes and 
hardy trees which fringe the rocks, only serving by contrast 
to heighten the prevailing ruggedness. An enormous rock 
forming a natural archway through which the stream runs so 
as to make farther research impossible, concludes our navi- 
gation. A more extended view still may be obtained by 
ascending the right bank of Peers Gill and going as far as 
eyes unaccustomed to precipices will permit us. 

There is also a grand walk along the summit of the ^txtz^ 
on the south-eastern side of the lake. The ridge is reached 
by the Burnmoor Tarn path, (page 145) until getting behind 
the hill and then climbing the green slope on the right. 
The descent might be at the other end, and so fall into our 
route to Calder. 

J^^^ltfefell, which stands backward, between Yewbarrow 
and Great Gable, was very tempting to a tourist who ex- 
plored this neighbourhood some years ago ; and he set out 
to get to Buttermere by Black Sail and Scarth Gap. After 
hours of walking, he struck into the hollow between Kirk- 
fell and Great Gable ; and when he arrived within sight of 
a lake at night, he was confounded to find it still Wastwater. 
He had walked completely round the mountain, instead of 



3IO iButtcrmere ^District 

getting over it ! We observed to a comrade that this could 
not have happened if the tourist had carried a pocket- 
compass. * And not having a compass/ said our friend, ^ he 
fetched one.' 



The vigorous pedestrian will certainly ascend ^cafell 
'J^lke before he leaves Wastdale; and it may be done by 
those who have come from Buttermere and still leave time 
to go on to Calder or return to his head-quarters the same 
evening. For those who are racing against time, and are 
anxious to make each course in some seconds less than it 
has ever been done before, the most direct way is advisable, 
and that is, starting from any house at Wastdale Head, to 
make straight for the wall which runs down the face of 
Lingmell, (not the one by which the ordinary route goes, but 
higher up the valley). This leads over the top of Jliingmell 
to ^eers ©ill ^K^9^^» but, as soon as the brow becomes 
not so exceedingly steep, the wall should be abandoned, and 
a straight course made over smooth slopes of grass, which 
are exceedingly good going, for the base of the huge mound 
of loose stone lying right in front, at about three-quarters of 
a mile distance, up which is the last ascent and the summit 
is reached. For the benefit of the foolish folk who choose 
this rpute, it may be mentioned that good time from Ritson's 
to the top is ih. 20m. 

' But he who wishes to rescue a day completely from the 
oblivion which conceals nearly all our past " good times," 
and to bear a faithful image in his memory of the more 
striking features of this majestic mountain, should not hurry 
himself to make the ascent at all hazards, but wait till some 
happy morning gives him "promise of a glorious day.'' 



^cafelL 311 

Then let him explore the hidden grandeurs of Peers Gill, 
and, after clambering up the bed of the ravine to the water- 
fall, or farther should he be athletic enough to find it prac- 
ticable, let him take to the mountain-side, careful to do so 
on the right bank of the ravine, and, keeping sufficiently- 
close to the edge of the chasm, use it as a guide, till it fades 
away to nothing, leaving him with one smart climb to the 
Col directly above, where he joins what may be called the 
carriage-drive up Scafell Pikes, whence the road is unmis- 
takeable. 

Three or four hours may be well spent in making the 
ascent ; the intelligent traveller will be so often tempted to 
linger, contemplating the works of the mighty forces of 
nature, roches moutonnees, indicating pre-historic glaciers, and 
the huge scar in the face of some tall cliff, which reveals 
the ravages of yesterday's storm. No other route takes one 
so immediately into the heart of the mountains. Here will 
be found no sandwich papers, empty bottles, or tgg shells, 
to obtrude the incongruous image of the outer world ; the 
only visible " appanage to human kind " is the numerous 
sheep, who express their displeasure at having their solitude 
disturbed by a sound between a hiss and a whistle peculiar 
to mountain breeds, and quite in harmony with the cruel 
croak of the raven and the harsh scream of the buzzard, 
which will, probably, be the only accompanying voices. 
At an altitude of about 2,000ft., the ravine divides into two; 
the smaller, Strait ©til running immediately to the highest 
point of ^ingmcll, which is worth ascending if only for 
the sake of enjoying the noble sport of rolling stones down 
a precipice, under the most favourable circumstances. The 
main-stream which flows down Peers Gill, henceforth runs 
almost at right angles to its course lower down. Imme- 
diately before reaching the angle formed at this junction, 



312 ^©uttermtre ^fettict, 

there occurs the only piece of climbing to be achieved in the 
ascent : it is only about ten yards, and is not of a character 
to try even very weak nerves. The ascent by the left bank 
of Piers Gill is just possible ; but the feat of crossing Strait 
Gill is one which demands a practised cragsman — which, 
of course, means that I never attempted it myself and never 
mean to do so. Up to that point there is no difficulty, but 
the fact of being close to a sheer precipice of a height vary- 
ing from 400 to 600 feet, is enough to scare away some of 
the timid ones. The grander crags are on that side all the 
way, and are, therefore, not so well seen as from the oppo- 
site bank. 

The whole of the N.W. region of the Pikes is well worth 
careful exploration. I think it mere vanity to insist on 
reaching the cairn, leaving unnoticed so much that surpasses 
that shapeless heap of debris which crowns the mountain. 
Just before reaching the well-marked sheep-track which leads 
to Peers Gill Head, turn to your left and make your way on 
nearly level ground, by Cauld Kell Bield and Round How, 
to a nameless stream descending from the Col, on the oppo- 
site side of which is Calf Cove and the high road up the 
Pikes from Langdale to Borrowdale. Climb by this very 
small rivulet till it vanishes and then on, nearly due north, 
till you stand on Far Crag, the extreme point of the Scafell 
range in this direction, and you have a view of Borrowdale 
and Derwentwater, which is worth fifty of that from the 
Pikes. Or, follow the stream downwards till it shows signs 
of approaching a fall, when you will see a large stream 
coming from close to Peers Gill Head and tending to co- 
incidence with the one you have accompanied. The two 
ravines down which these two twin streams immediately 
precipitate themselves form, conjointly, GirlaGill; and the 
best way to investigate, perhaps, the noblest waterfall in the 



Lake District, is to scramble down the tongue of land which 
here divides them. Should this look awkward (and it looks 
much worse than it is), cross the larger stream to the left 
bank and everything will be straightforward, and ten minutes 
more will bring you to the meeting of the waters from Peers 
Gill and Girla Gill. Now ascend towards Sty Head, but 
keeping on Scafell ground, and before coming in sight of 
Sty head Tarn, two more of these narrow clefts, which are 
almost peculiar to this mountain, will be passed. The first 
is, as far as I can make out, anonymous, but, though on a 
small scale, contains a waterfall which would be very beau- 
tiful if its supply of water were properly arranged. The 
second is called ^feebJ ©ill and would be a show place any- 
where else. It is, happily, distinguishable from the others 
by affording a passable road along its bed, which leads 
nearly to the summit of Great End; and I would here 
recommend the descent from Far Crag down this ravine, 
but it is difficult to indicate marks sufficiently distinctive to 
make sure of finding the right way, and even a moderate 
divergence from it on this side might easily bring the unwary 
to considerable grief. Between two ravines there is another 
route to the Pikes, which I consider the best for anyone who 
has, for any reason, to make jStg ^K^atJ the point of his 
departure. This slants along the mountain-side a little after 
passing the foot of Skew Gill, to the head of the nameless 
Gill, which head is a small plain called Strand. Here a 
small mountain-ash comes in sight a few yards below, and a 
pile of stones erected in sport by some dalesman and called 
Sam' Torn Grandfather, is in front. A sharp turn to the 
left, up the watercourse for ten minutes, and a pool of water, 
too diminutive even to be called a tarn, is visible, and a 
very few yards beyond this is revealed the small stream 
mentioned before, descending from Calf Cove Col. A few 



314 ^uttetmete ^isstrict. 

minutes up this stream and the principal road to the Pikes 
is reached ; but the preferable course is to strike for Peers 
Gill Head, reversing the former route. 

* An exceedingly pleasant day's work is to surround the 
Pikes (speaking somewhat Hibernice) by Sty Head and 
Sprinkling Tarn to Esk Hause, then down by the side of 
the infant Esk, under the fearful cliffs of Broad Crag and 
Long Crag, which are not seen at present by three tourists 
in a season, (about that number come down this valley yearly 
by reason of loosing their way,) till the battlemented front 
of Scafell appears to bar the way, and the stream, on which 
there is a first-class waterfall, (that is among the lake water- 
falls), descends from X^trftletiore. In the direction indicated 
by this stream it is very pleasant and easy climbing to the 
ridge of Mickledore. I was for many years at a loss to 
account for the terrific account given of the Eskdale side 
of Mickledore, in Black's Guide, till last year I happened 
to find a tour in the Lakes in an early vol. of the Penny 
Magazine, which is clearly the rough draft from which the 
Guide was afterwards developed. I found the well-remem- 
bered words, but applied to a very different matter, " the 
bastion cliffs of Scafell above Mickledore." (This account 
of the Lakes is well worth reading. I think the vol. is for 
1837). To the descent of these the account fairly applies; 
but in ascending there is no risk : if the right spot is hit 
upon and the initial difficulty surmounted,' the rest is plain 
sailing ; if either of these conditions be unfulfilled, it is bet- 
ter to remain in safety on the ridge. From Mickledore, 
Wastwater is just visible, and, skating down one of the 
heaps of Screes which flow on either hand, threading a path 
through the scattered boulders called Hollow Stanes, which 
at one time must have marked the end of a glacier, and 
taking a moderate run down Brown Tongue, and a pleasant 



"ISSJ'astlrrater, 315 

saunter by the side of Lingmell Beck, you arrive once more 
at Wastdale Head/ 

The tourist having visited one or other of these places of 
interest at Wastdale, and refreshed himself at Ritson's little 
inn, it will be time to make way towards Calder Bridge, 
where a bed has been ordered. Our route is by the mar- 
gin of the far-famed '^SS'astbjater, — the most solemn and 
imposing of all the lakes. The road winds pleasantly round 
bays and over promontories. Several brooks and rills are 
passed flowing down from the hills ; and the stranger ex- 
claims that he should like to spend a whole summer here, 
to explore all the ways among the mountains. There are 
the ScxtZQ, with the grey and still lake, — almost too deep 
to be ever frozen, — lying at the base of their prodigious 
sweep ! The lake is three and a-half miles long, and The 
Screes occupies the whole of its south-eastern shore. The 
line of this singular range is almost unbroken. The crags 
are hidden, about a third of the way down, by the slope of 
the many-coloured Mris which slants right into the lake. 

The summer thunderstorm and the winter tempest some- 
times shiver the loosely-compacted crags above ; and then, 
when a large mass comes thundering down and splashes 
into the lake, the whole range feels the shock, and sUdes 
of stones rush into the water ; and clouds of dust rise into 
the air. 

Perhaps the very best spot for getting a general view of 
the lake and its surroundings is in the grounds of Wastdale 
Hall, at the south-eastern end, to do which we believe per- 
mission will be kindly given at the lodge. After entering 
the grounds, the visitor should turn to the right and by the 
path reach the point where he commands the whole stretch 
of the water. 



3i6 ^uttermcre district' 

Between here and ^tranbs (a mile and a-half) the 
road is a pretty lane, with frequent gates. The little vil- 
lage is composed of two inns, a pretty little church, 
schools, parsonage, a few cottages, and one or two flourish- 
ing-looking farms. It has no appearance of being ^ out of 
the way ; ' but within a mile of it as we have seen, there is the 
most rugged and least-frequented of all the scenery in the 
district. It is a most convenient starting-point for visiting 
Wastwater and the surrounding scenery, but, at present, 
owing to the limited accommodation, it is hardly a suitable 
place for Paterfamilias making any lengthened stay. Those, 
however, bent on mountaineering or extreme solitude, un- 
doubtedly find this and Wastdale Head among the best of all 
places in the district ; and many is the number of university 
men and others who retreat to the latter place after their 
labours to enjoy complete repose. 

The carriage roads from the Strands are limited to two 
only ; that through Eskdale, and that to Calder Abbey and 
its environs. It is the latter we are now about to describe. 
After climbing the long hill from Strands, an eager look-out 
will be kept for the Isle of Man : but the most probable 
point for seeing it is at the top of the hill between Gosforth 
(the reddest of villages) and Calder Bridge. Far oft at sea 
rises the outline of its mountains ; and when the wind is 
east, we have repeatedly seen the shadows filling the hollows 
of its hills. From this eminence, the road descends through 
an avenue of beech, ash, and other trees, to ©"alber 

Here the travellers will rest for the night at the comfort- 
able inn. In the morning, the first object will be visiting 
the ^.^bbeg, and it will save time if the carriage be ordered 
to be at Captain Irwin's gate within an hour from the

time of starting. They must now step into the inn gar- 
den at the bridge, and see how beautifully the brown waters 
swirl away under the red bridge and its ivied banks, while 
the waving ferns incessantly checker the sunshine. It is a 
mile to the Abbey, through the churchyard, and along the 
bank of the Calder, where again the most beautiful tricks 
of light are seen, with its brown water and white foam, red 
precipitous banks, and the greenest vegetation, with a wood 
crowning all. The scene is thoroughly monastic. There 
is no sound at noon-day except the gushing water, the wood- 
man's axe and the shock of a falling tree, or the whir of a 
magpie, or the pipe of the thrush : but at night the rooks, 
on their return to roost, fill the air with their din. The ruins 
are presently seen, springing sheer from the greenest turf. 
Relics from the abbey are now placed beside the way : and 
a modern house appears at hand. The ruins should be 
approached from that front, so that the lofty pointed arches 
may best disclose the long perspective behind of grassy 
lawn and sombre woods. The Abbey is built of red sand- 
stone of the neighbourhood, now sobered down by time (it 
was founded in A.D., 1134), into the richest and softest tint 
that the eye could desire. But little is known of it beyond 
its date, and the name of its founder, Ranulph, son of the 
first Ranulph de Meschines, a Norman noble. The church 
was small, as the scanty remains show : and the monastery, 
which now looks like a continuation of the same building 
could not have contained a numerous company. From the 
fragments of effigies preserved, it appears that some eminent 
persons were buried here ; but who these knights and nobles 
were their is no record to tell, — carefully as these memorials 
were wrought to secure the immortality of this world. The 
eye is first fixed by the remains of the tower, from whose 
roofless summit dangles the tufted ivy, and whose base is 



3i8 ^niizxmtxt ^District 

embossed by the small lilac blossoms of the antirrhinum ; 
but at last the great charm is found in an aisle of clustered 
pillars. Almost the whole aisle is standing, still connected 
by the cornice wall which supported the roof The honey- 
suckle and ivy climb till they fall over on the other side. 
There is a sombre corner where the great ash grows over 
towards the tower, making a sort of tent in the recess. 
There are niches and dark cells in the conventual range. 
It is a small ruin, but thoroughly beautiful : and when the 
stranger looks and listens, as he stands in the green level 
between woods, he will feel how well the monks knew how 
to choose their dwelling-places, and what it must have been 
to the earnest and pious among those Cistercians to pace the 
river bank, and attune their thoughts to the unceasing 
music of the Calder flowing by. In the broad noon it is a 
fine thing to see the shadows flung, short and sharp, on the 
sward, and to catch the burnish of the ivy, and woo the 
shade of the avenue : and, in the evening, it is charming to 
see how the last glow of the west brings out the projections 
and recesses of the ruins, and how the golden moon hangs 
over the eastern mass of tree tops, ready to take her turn in 
disclosing the beauties of the monastic retreat. 

The Abbey is carefully preserved, and liberally laid open 
to strangers by the owner. It is no fault of his that this 
house, a plain substantial modern dwelling, stands too near 
the ruins. He did not build it : so there is nothing personal 
in the natural wish of strangers that it stood somewhere else. 

At the gate the carriage is waiting, and it takes the cross 
road, almost opposite the gate, up to Cold Fell. The drive 
over that fell is commonly called dreary ; and it is so in bad 
weather : but it has its charms. The sea-view is fine, — all 
flecked with cloud-shadows as with islands : and so too is 
the wide down sprinkled with sheep, that look as ragged as

terriers, after tearing their fleeces with the furze and brambles 
with which the swelUng slopes are embossed. In a hollow, 
at rare intervals, stands here and there a farmhouse under 
its sycamore canopy ; and far away, between the slopes of 
the down below, the soil is cut up into fields, with woods 
hanging above^ At the mouth of the vale, between it and 
the coast, stands ^grEmont, a little town which looks very 
pretty from the uplands; — and cheerful too, in spite of 
its Roman name, (*the mount of Sorrow.') It is distinguished 
by romantic traditions. It was at the gateway of Egremont 
Castle that the horn was hung, in crusading days, which was 
twice blown by the gallant Eustace de Lacy. As the Cum- 
brians tell. Sir Eustace and his brother Hubert rode forth 
together to the Holy Wars ; and Sir Eustace blew the horn, 
saying to his brother, * If I fall in Palestine, do thou return 
and blow this horn, and take possession; that Egremont 
may not be without a Lacy for its Lord.' In Palestine am- 
bition of this Lordship so took possession of Hubert, that 
he hired ruffians to drown his brother in the Jordan : and 
the ruffians assured him that the deed was done. He 
returned home, and stole into the castle by night, — not 
daring to sound the horn. But he soon plucked up spirit, 
and drowned his remorse in revels. In the midst of a 
banquet one day, the horn was heard sounding such a blast 
that the echoes came back from the fells, after starting the 
red deer from his covert, and the wild boar from his drink- 
ing at the tarn. Hubert knew that none but Eustace could 
or would sound the horn ; and he fled by a postern while 
his brother Eustace entered by the gate. Long after, the 
wretched Hubert came to ask forgiveness from his brother ; 
and having obtained it, retired to a convent, where he prac- 
tised penance till he died. The ruins of the castle stand 
on an eminence to the west of the town. 



320 ^uttermere ^fetrict. 

Before descending to Ennerdale Bridge, the outline of 
the Scotch mountains may sometimes be seen. Few travel- 
lers see more of this lake than in passing ; but it deserves 
more attention than is generally bestowed upon it, being 
exceedingly wild, though it is not possessed of the solem- 
nity of Wastwater. It has a curious little island, com- 
posed entirely of stones, so much alike in size and shape as 
to lead to the enquiry whether they can have been brought 
there for building purposes. One glance down into the clear 
water, where they may be seen to a great depth, will show 
that such is not the case, there being too vast a quantity to 
admit of the supposition. The southern side of the lake is 
closed in by Crag Fell, Revelin, and Iron Crag. As seen 
from the water. Crag Fell has the appearance of being 
crowned with a fort. Herdhouse and Red Pike form the 
northern boundary. The lake has its traditions, as well as 
several wild tales of the adventures and escapes of pede- 
strians who have explored the mountains in its neighbour- 
hood. It is said that a gentleman once lived at How Hall, 
a house not far from the inn, who dealt in the black art ; 
and some of his doings are still related. On one occasion 
he was with a party of friends in a boat on the lake, when 
remarking that it was time for him to leave' them, he plunged 
headlong into the water. The friends waited and searched 
for him in vain, and at length returned home believing him 
to be drowned, when, to their amazement, they found him 
sitting dry and snug by his own fireside. 

The Angler's Inn, at Ennerdale, is as clean and comfort- 
able as it is homely, and in it we have fared well. After 
some luncheon, our travellers will be ready for a survey of 
the lake and its surroundings. The storm-stricken boat- 
landing, which is close to the inn, will give an idea of what 
must sometimes be the state of the elements at this spot. 



Ennertiale. 321 

When we last visited it, nothing less than a waterspout, 
one thought, could have produced such a state of disorder 
among the heavy boulders on the shore. JBxi^fjint^ is the 
object of most persons who embark; and, we are informed 
that there is better sport here than in most of the waters of 
the district. The angler may also have complete solitude 
under the grey rocks and hills which rise on either hand 
upwards of two thousand feet. 

There are mountain-roads from Ennerdale to Lowes 
Water, over Blake Fell, and by Floutern Tarn to Scale 
Force and Buttermere. The distance to each is six miles. 
The Blake Fell road, presently to be mentioned, parts off 
from the other in a northerly direction just before ^Joutcrn 
51? am is reached. The road to Buttermere is not well- 
marked between the tarn and Scale Force, as the ground is 
boggy. The tarn must be passed on the right, and then the 
general direction is easterly. There are three sheep-folds 
which must be passed ; and if the day is clear the traveller 
may guide himself in his descent by keeping in a line with 
the Vale of Newlands, the top of which is distinctly 
visible. 

We have mentioned the young man who spent the whole 
of a precious day in walking round Kirkfell. Worse hap- 
pened to two gentlemen who went with a pony, but without 
a guide, from Buttermere to Wastdale Head,»by Scarf Gap 
and Black Sail. When crossing the top of Ennerdale valley, 
wind and rain met them. They struggled part of the way 
along Blacksail, when they became bewildered, and soon so 
exhausted that they had a narrow escape with their lives. 
But for a brandy-flask, which one of them carried, they could 
not have survived. The pony seems to have sunk as rapidly 
as the men. These gentlemen have publicly suggested the 
erection of some conspicuous landmarks, to show the track ;

and they have uttered their warning in corroboration of so 
many others, against crossing mountains without a guide. 
One of their chief difficulties, was the paths being turned 
into water-courses, and thereby disguised. It was on the 
same track that the three ladies mentioned by Mr. Green in 
his ' Guide ' lost their way, from dismissing their guide too 
soon, and actually stayed all night on the mountain, where, 
if it had not been fine summer weather, they would have 
perished. They took a guide over Scarth Gap, and as far as 
the junction of the three roads from Buttermere, Ennerdale, 
and Wastdale. The guide left them on the right road, and 
with full information as to the rest of the way : they took 
the wrong side of the way, however, and so got bewildered. 
It was only 4 p.m. when the guide left them : but darkness 
overtook them still wandering. When they came down 
again upon Tyson's house, early in the morning, the family 
could not believe the story of their descent, so perilous was 
the way they had come. One of the ladies had, however, 
lost a pocket-book, and they had seen a dead sheep : and, 
somebody immediately going up, these incidents were veri- 
fied : and the adventure of the ladies remains one of the 
wonders of the dales. 

We once had an adventure in this neighbourhood, the 
moral of which is, the comfort of having a guide. We 
wanted to cross Blafte jFell to Lowes Water. The distance 
to Scale Hill was only six miles ; the time summer ; and the 
track well-marked on map and mountain. If there ever was 
a case in which a guide might be thought unnecessary, it was 
this : but two of the party were young strangers, and the 
third would not assume the charge of them. The heat was 
excessive that day ; so we lagged behind the guide, on the 
ascent, though he carried knapsack and baskets. He was a 
quiet-looking elderly mountaineer, who appeared to walk 



slowly ; but his progress was great compared with ours, from 
the uniformity and continuity of his pace. In the worst 
part of the walk, we tried the effect of following close be- 
hind him, and putting our feet in his tracks ; and we were 
surprised to find with what ease we got on. At first we 
stopped repeatedly, to sit down and drink from the streams 
that crossed the track or flowed beside it ; and during those 
halts we observed that the blackness which had for some 
time been appearing in the west, now completely shrouded 
the sea. Next, we remarked that while the wind still blew 
in our faces, — that is from the north-east, — the mass of wes- 
tern clouds was evidently climbing the sky. The guide quietly 
observed that there would be rain by and bye. Next, when 
in the middle of the wild fell, and we saw how puzzling 
the network of swampy paths must be at all times, we pointed 
out to one another how the white fleeces of cloud below the 
black mass swept round in a circle, following each other like 
straws in an eddy. Soon the dark mass came driving up at 
such a rate that it was clear we should not finish our walk 
in good weather. The dense mist was presently upon us. 
On looking behind, to watch its rate of advance, we saw a 
few flashes of lightning burst from it. The thunder had by 
this time been growling afar, almost incessantly. The 
moment before the explosion of the storm was as like a 
dream as a waking state can be. We were walking on wild 
ground, now ascending, now descending ; a deep tarn (Flou- 
tem Tarn) on our right hand, our feet treading on slippery 
rushes or still more slippery grass ; the air was dark as 
during an eclipse ; and heavy mists drove past from behind 
just at the level of our heads, and sinking every moment ; 
while before us ; and far below us — down as in a different 
world — lay Buttermere and the neighbouring vales, sleeping 
in the calmest sunshine. The contrast was singular — of 

w 2 



324 ^uttermete ^fgtrfci 

that warm picture, with its yellow lights and soft shadows, 
with the turbulence and chill and gloom of the station from 
which we viewed it We had but a moment to look at it ; 
for not only did the clouds sink before our eyes, but the 
wind veered round to the opposite point of the compass, 
throwing one after another of us flat as it passed. Within 
a few minutes one of us had six falls, from the force of the 
wind and the treachery of the ground, — now in a trice a 
medley of small streams. It was impossible to stop the 
guide for a moment's breath. In the roar of the blast, and 
crash of the thunder, and pelt of the hail, one might as well 
have spoken to the elements : so it was necessary for us to 
keep our pace, that he might not stride away from us entirely. 
Through stumblings and slidings innumerable, we did this, 
— the lightning playing about our faces the while, like a 
will-o'-the-wisp on the face of a bog. The hail and rain had 
drenched us to the skin ; they were driven in at every open- 
ing of our clothes ; they cut our necks behind, and filled 
our shoes ; our hats and bonnets were immediately soaked 
through, and everybody's hair wringing wet. The thunder 
seemed to roll on our very heads. In this weather we went 
plunging on for four miles, through spongy bogs, and turbid 
streams whose bridges of stones were hidden in the rushing 
waters, or by narrow pathways each one of which was con- 
verted by the storm into an impetuous brook. Wlien we 
had descended into a region where we could hear ourselves 
speak, we congratulated one another on our prudence in 
having engaged a guide. Without him, how should we have 
known the path from the brook, or have guessed where we 
might ford the stream, when the bridges were out of sight ? 
Two horses, we afterwards heard, were killed on the same 
fell in that storm : and it is my belief we should never have 
come down, if we had been left to wander by ourselves. 



^nnertiale* 325 

A very few tourists make their way from Ennerdale over 
the fells to Wastwater. That is certainly not the easiest way 
of getting there, and, excepting the Pillar and its surround- 
ing prospect be taken on the way, we would say also that it is 
not the most interesting. However, variety of scene is 
sometimes in request, and for the information of those who 
go that way we will give a few hints. The road by the 
northern side of the lake is to be taken leading on to the 
last farm called Gillerthwaite. A few hundred yards before 
it is reached, the stream must be crossed by a foot-bridge, 
after which the track runs a little way up the hill-side, crosses 
Low Beck, and, on coming to High Beck, it must be taken 
as a guide, keeping it on the right, until Windgap Cove, 
and finally Wind Gap, on the left, is reached. This is the 
summit, — 2569 feet. Some travellers will mount the 
^illKx; others will make their way to the Steeple on the 
right. They both command magnificent prospects. Those 
who are on their way to Wastdale will observe the p!^si$iz- 
tuale "yiTalleg and beck in the same direction they have been 
coming, namely south-east They will keep on the high 
ground, under the Crags, on the northern side of the stream, 
and presently come into the path from Black Sail Pass, and 
forward on easy ground to the hamlet, as at page 306. 

We perhaps ought to say that it is practicable to walk 
round Ennerdale Lake. There are bridges at both ends ; 
but we cannot promise a path along the southern shore. 

The extensive hilly-region between Ennerdale and Gos- 
forth is not visited by tourists, chiefly, we presume, because 
higher summits intervene between it and the lakes and con- 
sequently shut out the view of the water, which, after all, is 
the greatest attraction, ©'atw ~JE{zll (2 1 88 feet) is the highest 

W3

land in that direction. It commands a very good sea-view. 

We will now resume our excursion towards Buttermere. 
A carriage may be used up Ennerdale as far as the Gil- 
lerthwaite Farm (4 miles) ; after that, the traveller must 
* foot it ' for the remainder of the way. The valley is 
full of wild beauty, and deserves to be better known. 
The traveller has, on his left, Red Pike, High Stile 
and High Crag, and, on his right, Pillar and Kirk Fell, 
while in front, is Great Gable. The river that dashes down 
the centre is the J&ija, and the most interesting feature in 
the landscape is the ^iP^illar ^Eioctt. so like a gigantic column 
as to give its name to the mountain of which it forms part. 
It was once believed that the rock was inaccessible, but there 
have been adventurous tourists on the top of it, whose names, 
it is said, are preserved in a bottle which is left in a crevice on 
the summit. The ascent is looked upon as foolhardy by 
some of the most experienced guides of the district. The 
defile between High Crag and the Pillar is close and bold, 
those mountains rising very steeply on each side of the 
stream. In two miles and a half from Gillerthwaite there 
is a sheep-fold and a quarry on the left, just beyond which 
the j^cattlj ^£clt, coming down from High Crag, is 
crossed; and, almost immediately afterwards, the sources 
of two lesser tributaries of the Liza are stepped over. After 
these, the path crossing the head of the valley will soon be 
reached. Here we turn at a sharp angle to the left. If the 
weather be favourable, a few hundred yards may be saved by 
taking to the hill-side immediately after crossing Scarth 
Beck. Follow the stream towards its source, and, in a quar- 
ter of a mile the Scarth Gap path will be found. The re- 
mainder of the journey towards the hotel at Buttermere is 
detailed at page 297.

BY GREAT GABLE AND STY HEAD PASS TO LANG- 
DALE. 
(14 miles.) 

This is an important and most interesting walk from 
Buttermere; indeed no finer work can be found in the 
district. It is commenced precisely the same as the last 
excursion, as explained at pages 303 — 5, that is, by Scarth 
Gap, the river Liza, Windy Gap between the two Gables, top 
of Great Gable, and down to ^tg K^a^ 5E^arn. 

This jStg ^K^9^^ is the den or home of the wild boars of 
former times, where the swine were wont to feed in summer, 
and to haunt the woody part of Wastdale Forest, and the 
long valley of Borrowdale, (more properly Boredale) in the 
autumn, where they fed upon the nuts and acorns. But the 
traveller will find no swine near Sty Head now, summer or 
winter. No creature comes to drink at the tarn, — the little 
clear rippling lake, where the mountaineer throws himself 
down to rest on the bank, when heated by the ascent from 
the vales. He has found everything sunny and dry, per- 
haps ; but here he sees, by the minute diamond drops rest- 
ing thick on the grass, that a cloud has lately stooped from 
its course, and refreshed the verdure in this retreat. It looks 
very tempting, — this bright sheet of water ; but no creature 
now comes to drink, unless a sheep may have strayed from 
the flock, and in its terror may yet venture to stoop to water, 
with many a start and interval of listening, till, at the faint 
sound of the distant sheep-dog, it bounds away. The soli- 
tude is equally impressive, whether the traveller comes up 
from one dale or the other ; but perhaps the most striking to 
him who comes from Wastdale, because he has rather more 



328 IButtermerc E>fetrtct, 

lately left the dwellings of men. He ascends from Wast- 
dale Head, by the steep path clearly visible from below, up 
the side of Great Gable. At the top of the pass, the view 
behind is extremely fine, — the dale lying i,ooo feet below, 
while the precipices of Scafell rise 2,000 feet over head. 
The rill from Sprinkling Tarn is close by, and it leads to 
this Sty Head Tarn, where the boars used to come to drink. 
Long after the boars were gone, the eagles came hither : and 
this was one of their last haunts. The Ragles which gave 
their name to the crag in Borrowdale, being disturbed, 
settled themselves on a rock at Seathwaite, and at length 
crossed the ridge into Eskdale. The disturbance was of 
course from the shepherds, who lost so many lambs as to be 
driven desperate against the birds. There was no footing 
on the crag by which the nest could be reached ; so a man 
was lowered by a rope sixty yards down a precipice. He 
carried his mountain-staif with him ; its spiked end being 
the best weapon against the birds. He did not expect to 
kill the old ones ; but year after year the eggs or the young 
were taken. If he brought the young away alive he had 
the birds for his pains, if the eggs, every shepherd gave him 
five shillings for every egg. It is said that not more than two 
eggs were found at one time. The nest was made of twigs 
and lined with a sort of grass from the clefts of the rock. 
When the fowler failed, and the eaglets were reared, they 
were led away as soon as strong enough by the parent birds, 
— no doubt to settle in some other spot ; and the parents 
returned without them. One of this pair was shot at by the 
master of a sheep-dog which had been actually carried some 
distance into the air by it, escaping only by the flesh giving 
way. The shot took effect, but the eagle vanished. About 
a. week after, it was found lying on the grass on the uplands 
at Seatoller, nearly starved. Its bill had been split by the 



^a JlkangtJale, 329 

shot, and its tongue was set fast in the cleft : it could not 
make much resistance, and was carried home captive. But 
when relieved and restored, it became so violent that it was 
necessarily killed. Its mate brought a successor from a 
distance, a much smaller bird, and of a different species. 
They built, however, for fourteen more years in Borrowdale, 
before they flew over to Eskdale. They were not long left 
in peace there ; and when the larger bird was at length shot, 
his mate disappeared entirely. Such devastation as was 
caused by these birds is not heard of now ; but while there 
are crags aloft, and lambs in the vales, there will be more or 
fewer, nobler or meaner birds of prey. We are unable to 
ascertain positively, amidst conflicting testimony, whether 
any eagles at all remain in the region. Three gentlemen — 
two of whom are travelled men, and not likely to be mis- 
taken in such a matter — declare that, in 1850, they saw 
one sweep down Scandale Fell into Kirkstone Pass, and 
rest on a crag in the vale, some way above Brothers' Water. 
There is, however, a preponderance of disbelief of there 
being now any nest or settlement of eagles among the 
mountains of Westmorland and Cumberland. 

From Sty Head Tarn to ^pttnfelintf 5Uam, and on to 
J^uqIz 5I?arn there is a track whose general course is due 
south-westward, running under Great End and Bow Fell on 
the right, the Longstrath Valley, leading into the Stake Pass 
and to Rosthwaite, opening out on the left. The descent 
into Langdale by ^ossett ©ill is decidedly rough travel- 
ling for a mile, and then we have two miles of cart-road 
at the head of the Great Langdale Valley, before reaching 
the Dungeon Gill Hotel. 

The return journey to Buttermere might be by Wastdale 
Head, Black Sail and Scarth Gap.

RED PIKE, HIGH STILE, AND HIGH CRAG. 
(6 miles of hill- work and 3 of road). 

It is a tempting piece of work for the hardy pedestrian to 
ascend ^eb ^ike by Sourmilk Gill, visiting Bleaberry Tarn, 
(which contains lots of trout) on the way, and return home 
on the ridge over High Stile, and High Crag, and then down 
by the Scarth Gap path. It is a scramble up the Gill, but 
there can be no difficulty about the way, for the brawling 
beck is there as a guide to ^leabett2 3?atn, from whence 
the summit is visible and must be reached by winding among 
the crags. Those, however, who cannot accomplish such 
very steep work, can reach the summit by the Scale Beck, 
taking the same course as recommended at the top of page 
300. From the summit of Red Pike there is an unusually 
wide prospect, it being open all round excepting in the 
direction of High Stile. Five lakes are seen and some of 
the highest mountain-groups in the district* The best 
walking ground, in our direction, is slightly under the 
southern ridge; but most of the way to High Crag and 
Scarth Pass is rough and stony. However, if the elements 
permit wandering about the knolls, the traveller will be well 
rewarded. 



TO BORROWDALE, DERWENTWATER, AND KESWICK. 
(20 miles. ) 
The majority of persons who stay at Buttermere have 

* While standing here it will be obvious what a short cut this is to 
Ennerdale, the best way being by the depression in the direction of 
Gillerthwaite farm. 



■^ale of Ji^Qviaru 331 

previously seen Keswick and its environs. Moreover, we 
have so amply described them in the preceding section, and 
also the various roads between there and our present head- 
quarters (see pages 245 to 253) as to render it quite un- 
necessary to give details here. Those who have nof seen 
beautiful Borrowdale will undoubtedly pay it an early visit, 
for they cannot employ their time better. Most likely, the 
route will be by Honister Pass, Borrowdale, Keswick, and 
back by the Vale of Newlands. 



THE VALES OF LORTON AND NEWLANDS. 
(22 miles ) 

This is a favourite drive. Scale Hill and the Station in 
Lanthwaite Wood, are visited on the way. After this, the 
scenery is merely rural ; but there is the "^£^1 tree to visit, 
chiefly famous from Wordsworth's lines. 

* There is a Yew-tree, pride of Lorton Vale, 
Which to this day stands single in the midst 
Of its own darkness, as it stood of yore. 
Not loth to furnish weapons for the bands 
Of Umfraville or Percy, ere they march'd 
To Scotland's heaths ; or those that crossed the sea, 
And drew their sounding bows at Agincourt, 
Perhaps at earlier Cressy or Poictiers. 
Of vast circumference and gloom profound, 
This solitary tree ! — a living thing 
Produced too slowly ever to decay ; 
Of form and aspect too magnificent 
To be destroyed.* 

The return route is generally by Lorton Fell (page 253) 
and the Vale of Newlands (page 249). 



332 ^uttermere district 



GRASSMOOR, WHITESIDE, SAND HILL, GRISEDALE 

PIKE, EEL CRAG, AND WHITELESS PIKE. 

(14 miles of hill- work). 

The great mountain mass, of which Grassmoor is the 
highest point (2791 feet), which covers the whole country 
between Derwentwater and Crummock Water, is of the 
highest interest to those who can ' rough it ' on the fells. 
The views commanded from the different summits of the 
group are of the most various character. From Grassmoor, 
is seen the whole of the rugged valley of Buttermere, 
Crummock, and Loweswater, and, away northwards over 
quiet uplands, to Solway and the Scotch Hills, while to the 
south and west we have the Scafell group and the peaks 
about Ennerdale. Whiteside affords a more extensive view 
over the rich vale towards Cockermouth. Grisedale Pike 
overlooks Bassenthwaite, Derwentwater, with Skiddaw and 
Saddleback for a background. At Eel Crag the view is 
more confined to the south ; but, on getting round to White- 
less Pike, the Buttermere Valley is again displayed. This 
is indeed a glorious round on the hill tops. 

The best way to begin this circuit is to ascend Ranner- 
dale Knott, as described at page 295 ; but, before getting to 
the extreme end of the hill, turn off to the right, and take Ran- 
nerdale Beck as a guide to the summit of ©Grassmoor, keep- 
ing on the south-eastern side of the stream under Whiteless 
Pike. On the top, a fine smooth plateau will be found, over 
which the mountaineer will spring with delight. We doubt 
whether we should recommend the considerable deviation 
to Whiteside, because what is to be seen from there is equally 
well done from j^antu ~^Sii\\ (2525) which is on the direct 



X2Elountain M^&ctni^. 333 

way to ©rfsebale ^ikz. When the latter has been reached 
the ©Toletiale Beck, and the road running by its side, should 
be noted in the valley below. This is the way up from 
Keswick, and, of course, the way down if our traveller wishes 
to go in that direction. He will easily get down to the 
Forcecragg Mines which are seen at the top of the road. We 
complete the circuit by ^^el ©Traty (2648) and thence to 
"^S^S^T^^iteless ]I^tke, from whence we get down on the 
southern slope towards Sail Beck, and so home by the 
Knotts. 



ROBINSON. 
(5 miles). 

After having done Grassmoor, there is little to say in 
favour of ^Ei0bin0on. However, it is a much shorter and 
less arduous walk, while the north-westward views from the 
summit are grand. The way is by the main road past the 
church for about a mile and a-half, when the road begins to 
descend towards Keswick. Here cross the beck on the 
right and take to the hill-side. It is only about a mile to 
the summit, in a south-easterly direction. 



MELLBEEAK. 
(Smiles.) 

This is an easy and delightful walk. The route com- 
mences the same as to Scale Force, (page 299). The beck 
must be crossed at the fall, and a north-easterly direction 
taken on the slope of the hill. In half a mile Black Beck 



334 ;]©uttcttnere district 

will be crossed and the walk continued, on good mountain 
ground, in the same direction as before. From the latter 
stream it is about a mile and a-half to the highest point. After 
enjoying the prospect, the descent may be made in the 
direction of Loweswater, which will bring the walker down 
into XSflgebale at a farm called Bargate. The road he is 
now upon may be taken up the valley for little more than a 
mile, where it turns sharply away to the right. Here it must 
be left for the hill-side. It is not necessary to chmb, but rather 
keep on the level at which the road is left. In about a mile 
the source of Black Beck will be reached, and the descent 
can be made in the depression towards Scale Force. 



SHovt (l£iunUx Course. 



Note. — By leaving out the Wastwater and Ennerdale region, 
which is very little visited, it will be seen that most of these Tours might 
be shortened to three days. 

A very few visitors enter the District at Penrith and go to Ullswater 
or Hawes Water first. These will easily adapt their work by taking up 
the Tours at those points. 



The whole of the Lake District has now been described in 
the course which will be found most convenient to the 
majority of tourists ; but a considerable number come to- 
have a * run through/ and, in order to enable them to make 
the best use of their time, the following Tours have been 
sketched out. 

It is unnecessary to repeat the information which has been 
already given. The traveller will therefore find, in the fol- 
lowing pages, merely an outline of his route, but, with the 
help of the Index, full descriptions may be found in the 
former part of the volume. 

Before starting, the pedestrian should see that he is well 
provided with travelling gear. He has, no doubt, a guide- 
book and map : but has he a compass ? If he will make 



00 



6 CTitciiIar ^ours* 



inquiries in any dale he visits, or at any farmhouse he passes, 
he will hear of tourists who have lost their way, many of 
them getting into difficulty and danger, and having to spend 
the night upon the mountains. Every house has its tale of 
one or more strangers coming in cold and exhausted after 
such nights, and seeking help ; or of others only saved from 
such a fate by having met with the farmer, or some one of 
his men, who has directed them into the right road to their 
destination. Often, again, a stranger may be heard to relate 
how he has left one valley with the intention of crossing to 
another, and, after hours of walking, has at last found him- 
self in the same from which he started, or even in one west 
of it, when he thought he was going east. The sequel to 
all these stories is that the stranger had no compass. A 
sudden fog may perplex even the best guides ; then also a 
compass is a necessary help. * Ah nivver sud eh gitten 
'em doon seeaf, if yan et gentlemen hedent hed a compass,' 
said one of the guides in relating an adventure among the 
mists on Scafell ; and plenty more might give similar testi- 
mony.

PART VII. 



METEOROLOGY. 

This subject is important and interesting to the Tourist, 
as much of his enjoyment depends on the changes of the 
weather to which he is liable. 

Few, if any, visit this part of the kingdom, without a pre- 
conceived apprehension that because in mountainous dis- 
tricts the weather is changeable and often wet, they must 
expect to meet with frequent and serious hindrances to 
their progress. It is true, that in July the weather is 
generally more unsettled with us than in any other month : 
but even then, as at other times, the experience of tourists 
will prove that there is very rarely a whole day, or, at any 
rate, there are still seldomer two or three successive days, in 
which their progress need be suspended. The very intervals 
between showers are often peculiarly enjoyable, from the 
purity of the air ; and the lights and shades on the moun- 
tains are in such intervals often truly captivating, and serve 
in great measure to lessen the disappointment of being 

X3 



342 X^fteorolocfg. 

6bliged to keep within doors more than is agreeable. 
Several such intervals will generally be found, in which one 
may stroll about without risk of suffering from showers. 

In the months of August and September, the weather is 
with us much more settled than in July ; and then day after 
day, and often week after week the tourist may calculate on 
a succession of rambles without interruption. 

We are aware, by the results obtained from the observa- 
tions of the late Dr. Miller, of Whitehaven, of the amazing 
depth of rain which falls on some of the Lake mountains. 
The annual average quantity of rain in many parts of the 
south of England does not exceed 20 inches, and sometimes 
does not reach even that amount ; but it was shewn by these 
observations, that in 1852, 81 inches were measured on Sea- 
fell Pike; at Great Gable 86; at Sty Head 124; at Seath- 
waite, Borrowdale, 156; and at Sprinkling Tarn 168 inches 
nearly. The mean rainfall for England is about 30 inches. 
The annual average at Kendal, in the south of the district, 
is 52 inches. This town and Keswick had, before these 
observations by Dr. Miller, been considered the wettest 
places known in England. Notwithstanding these great 
differences in the quantity of rain, the number of rainy days 
is not in the same ratio, there being no very great difference 
between the wettest locality and one in a much drier district. 
In several other parts of England, they have a greater number 
of days on which rain falls than in these where the quantity 
is so extraordinary. There are however places in the 
Tropics, where the annual quantity amounts to 200 and 
even 300 inches. In a district of Hindostan, N.E. of Cal- 
cutta, Dr. Hooker states that, in one month, 264 inches were 
measured ; and more than 600 is the annual fall there ! In 
comparison with these, how trifling is that of 20 or even 50 
inches in the year. In Provence, in the south of France, 



X3El£te0rcil0C(2- 343 

the fall in a year is about 20 inches. In 1843, they had 
but six days of rain in that year and two months of the 
following year; and in the next four months of 1844, only 
three, making nine days only in eighteen months on which 
rain fell. Who would not therefore prefer the favoured land 
in which we live to either of these districts? 

The quantity of rain in these mountainous districts appears 
from Dr. Miller's observations, to increase as we ascend the 
eminences, until we attain the height of 2,000 feet above the 
level of the sea, when it begins to diminish. In any one 
locality, if several guages are placed at different altitudes, 
the lowest almost invariably registers the greatest quantity. 
In the Lake District, Scafell Pike, which is the highest land 
in England, and 3,208 feet above the sea-level, registered in 
1847, 128 inches; and Sprinkling Tarn, 1961 feet high, 207 
inches. At the latter place, the largest quantity has been 
registered that has been yet taken in any situation. There 
are a few exceptions to these facts, however, in these very 
localities. 

The result of these observations shows that at least 60 
inches more rain are deposited in England than we were 
previously aware of; that 150 inches sometimes descend in 
the Lake District in a year — more than falls in most of the 
Tropics with which we are acquainted, and sufficient to 
drown two of the tallest men in Great Britain, standing one 
on the top of the other. They have further informed us of 
the fact, that six-and-a-half perpendicular inches of water 
are sometimes precipitated from the atmosphere in twenty- 
four hours, and ten inches in forty-eight hours, a quantity 
which would be thought large for any two consecutive months 
in most parts of England. The almost incredible depth of 
20 inches occasionally in a single month — a fall nearly 
equal to the calculated yearly average for all other parts of 



344 X3Elete0roIo52» 

England. Dr. Miller's experiments have, in short, enabled 
us to collect a number of new and curious facts bearing on 
the quantity and very unequal distribution of rain in this 
island. The law of gradation in the amount of rain between 
the valleys and the tops of the highest mountains, is also 
thus ascertained at various intermediate points, with a high 
degree of probability. 

A little consideration will greatly lesson our surprise at 
the enormous quantity of water deposited in the hilly dis- 
tricts of Westmorland and Cumberland. To those un- 
acquainted with these localities, it may be briefly stated that 
the Lake District valleys radiate from a series of mountains 
of slate and primitive rock, having Great Gable (2949 feet 
in height) as a nucleus or central point ; and in the imme- 
diate vicinity of which are Scafell and Pillar, of the respec- 
tive elevations of 3,162 and 2,927 feet, and Great End and 
Bowfell, and Glaramara not much inferior in altitude. These 
mountains are distant only about ten or twelve miles, in a 
direct line, from the Irish Sea, and, as no hills intervene, they 
are consequently fully exposed to our wet and prevailirig 
winds, which are from the S.W. The warm south-westerly 
current arrives at the coast loaded with moisture obtained in 
its transit across the Atlantic ; and these experiments justify 
the conclusion, that this current has its maximum density at 
about 2,000 feet above the sea-level ; hence it will travel on- 
ward until it is obstructed by land of sufficient elevation to 
precipitate its vapour ; and, retaining a portion of the velo- 
city of the lower parallels of latitude whence it was origin- 
ally set in motion, it rapidly traverses the short space of 
level country, and with little diminution of its weight or 
volume; sudden condensation consequently ensues, in the 
form of vast torrents of rain, which, in some instances, must 
descend almost in a continuous sheet, as when 9 or 10 inches 



XlEleteoroIosS- 345 

are precipitated in forty-eight hours. When we reflect that 
a warm moist current, perhaps only three or four degrees 
above the point of saturation, in coming in contact with the 
mountain-ridges, probably meets with a stratum of air ten 
or fifteen degrees lower than its own inherent temperature, 
we shall cease to marvel that such quantities as 4, 5, or even 
6 inches of water should be deposited in these localities in 
the course of a few hours. The mountains are, in fact, 
huge natural condensers, destined to force from the at- 
mosphere the mighty volumes of water requisite for the 
supply of our lakes and rivers. 

One might have supposed that the greatest fall of rain 
would have been at Wastdale Head, as it is surrounded 
by the highest mountains, and the valley opens out fairly to 
the S.W. But the maximum quantity is not found to obtain 
where theory would indicate, — the vale of Borrowdale, 
which affords the principal supply of water to the river Der- 
went, and the extensive and picturesque lakes of Derwent- 
water and Bassenthwaite. To refer again to the fact that 
among the mountains the quantity of rain increases to the 
altitude of 2,000, and then diminishes above that limit : — 
this may perhaps be accounted for by concluding that, as 
the clouds are seldom a mile high, (or little more than one 
and a half times the height of Scafell), in our climate, in 
winter, there can be no doubt that, during the winter months 
especially, the under surface of the Nimbus or rain-cloud, 
(the lowest except the Stratus), is far below the tops of our 
highest mountains, and we may safely conclude, not unfre- 
quently, its upper surface also. Now, when this is the case, 
the guages on Scafell, Great Gable, &c., will receive no rain 
at all, when it is descending abundantly in the valleys be- 
neath. The lowness of the rain-cloud at this season is pro- 
bably the principal cause of the small quantity of rain at 



346 X3Elete0tcilog2[» 

the hill tops in proportion to that in the valleys during the 
winter as compared with the summer months. 

The Winds in this part of our island are chiefly from the 
west and south-west, and these are loaded with moisture 
evaporated from the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. 
When their contents reach the colder air of the mountain- 
ous districts, they are condensed and are deposited on the 
sides of the eminences which arrest their progress, and thus 
occasion the extraordinary amounts of rain in these particu- 
lar localities. The difference in the temperature of different 
portions of a not very extended district in a mountainous 
country is often considerable. In the process of restoring 
the equilibrium thus temporally destroyed, currents and 
eddies of wind are propagated, and are often the causes of 
sudden and strong gusts which rush down the sides of the 
mountains, and agitate the surface of the adjoining lakes, to 
the risk of the slight sailing vessels that are kept on most 
of the larger sheets of water in the district. The agitation 
of the surface is often attributed by the natives to what are 
termed ' bottom winds,' or violent currents of air rising from 
the bottoms of the lakes, and thus causing these agitations 
of the surface. The various directions of the winds among 
the masses of the mountains, at no great distance from each 
other, may be ascribed to the various deflections of the 
aerial currents, occasioned by the different positions of the 
flanks of the hills, turning the direction of the current from 
its original course, so that a wind from the west, for instance, 
may be deflected by the flank of a mountain and become a 
north-west or south-west wind at another part near to the 
same place, according as the face of the hill may tend in 
one direction or the other. But little dependence on the 
probable changes of the weather can be placed in the direc- 



^otang* 347 

tion of the wind near the surface, as these confirmations of 
the eminences must often and sometimes very materially 
alter the original course of the currents in the air. The 
most reliable evidence is to be had from the course travelled 
by the clouds themselves ; and, if that be from the south or 
south-west, we recommend the tourist to have his umbrella 
or waterproof ready.

BOTANY. 

The Lake District, and the margin of comparatively level 
land extending to the Cumberland shore, affords such a 
scope for the natural production of plants as few of the 
English counties possess. 

The great diversity of altitude, and consequent variety of 
climate ; the numerous and extreme changes of mineral and 
vegetable soils; the complete circuit of aspect occasioned 
by the multiplicity and varied character of its hills and dales ; 
the perfect exposure to the sea-breezes in some parts, the 
exclusion from them in others ; and the very different de- 
grees of moisture to which the district is subject, accommo- 
date the growth of a great variety of British Flora — the 
product of almost every locality between extreme anglo- 
alpine and the verge of the sea. 

Perhaps no district, of the same limited extent, furnishes 
a more numerous assemblage of Cryptogamic plants ; that 
least explored but very beautiful department, and which may 
be not inappropriately called winter-botany. A great pro- 
portion of the singular system of blooming peculiar to this 



34^ ^otang. 

class is developed at the season when most other vegetation 
is at rest, and therefore uninteresting ; here then may the 
zealous botanical tourist still continue his study with as much 
ardour as in the summer ; and derive pleasure and edifica- 
tion from the contemplation of the various gay and modest 
tints of those minute works of the Creator, when the casual 
observer will find nothing to attract his attention from the 
general business of a wintry landscape. Those who would 
acquaint themselves with the Mosses and Lichens of the 
lake and mountain districts, will need some degree of per- 
severance and sure-footedness in exploring the dark ravines 
and cavernous fissures of the moist and sHppery rocks, and 
of the gloomy woods where these delight to grow : and will 
meet with perhaps the greatest variety, and those in the 
highest perfection, where the sun shines seldomest and the 
rain or spray from the waterfall falls oftenest among them. 
For it should be remembered that no satisfactory progress 
can be made in collecting and distinguishing the crypto- 
gamia when the plants are shrivelled by drought. 

No little energy will be requisite, also, to hunt out the 
lichens — some of which are found inhabiting almost every 
rood of undisturbed ground from the verge of the ocean to 
the storm-beaten summits of the highest mountains. And 
last, not least, very considerable patience is necessary to 
duly investigate and decipher the microscopic stamp of 
family, so minutely but distinctly impressed upon every 
specific member of the whole tribe of both mosses and 
lichens ; and a great many are too small to be accurately 
determined by the naked eye. But to the enthusiast in 
botany, the pleasing excitement of the pursuit, and the 
gratification of the capture, well reward the fatigues of the 
search. 

Mr. W. J. Linton has produced a very excellent little 



©eologg, 349 

book on the Ferns of the Lake District,* but we cannot 
point to any satisfactory detailed account of the Flora. 



GEOLOGY. 

Believing that the great majority of Lake tourists do not 
wish or expect to find an elaborate treatise on Geology 
in a volume intended chiefly to point out the beauties of the 
scenes and the readiest way of reaching them ; but feeling 
also that a complete Guide-book would scarcely merit the 
title did it not afford some information upon the marvellous 
arrangement and character of the different systems of rock 
of which this beautiful region is framed, we propose to sup- 
ply a moderate knowledge of the structure of our hills, f 

It were useless to speculate upon the long ages that 
elapsed during the formation of any one of the vast rocky 
systems of the district, and impossible to form any conception 
of the stupendous forces which, operating from beneath on 
the different stratifications, bestowed upon the region the 
grand external features that render it so attractive even to 
the most superficial observer. We, therefore, undertake 
merely to point out the localities of the various formations 
and to notice very shortly their nature and character. 

The Slate Rocks. — Nearly the whole area of the Lake 
District proper consists geologically of three great groups of 

* Windermere : J. Gamett. 

t This study may be much aided by the possession of Ruthven's 
Geological Map of the Lake District, to be had of Mr. Stanford, Lon- 
don ; or the Publisher, Mr. Garnett, Windermere. 



350 ©ealorjg. 

slate rock, as first pointed out by that self-taught and sound 
geologist, the late venerable Jonathan Otley, of Keswick. 
These vary considerably in form, character, and aspect, but 
agree, as their name indicates, in possessing more or less 
perfectly, the property of cleavage, or of being split into 
slate or flags. This attribute, however, is in many parts, 
either lost entirely, or greatly impaired by the influence of 
Plutonic eruptions, which have forced their way into and 
through the slaty strata so as greatly to modify, not only 
their disposition and arrrangements, but also their specific 
structure. 

The oldest of these slate-rock formations is that called 
Skiddaw Slate, which covers a tract of country extending 
from the vicinity of Egremont eastward to that of Grey stoke, 
and from Keswick northward to Isell and Bewaldeth. It 
contains the Lakes Bassenthwaite, Crummock, and Lowes- 
water, and forms the mountains of Saddleback and Skiddaw, 
and that beautiful range which rises between the vales of the 
Derwent and Cocker, including Grasmoor, Whiteside, and 
Grisedale Pike. The aspect of the country it forms, though 
not so rugged as that of the next group of slate rock, 
sufficiently indicates that this formation has been subjected 
to the action of some enormous elevating and deranging 
powers, and, though of vast thickness, the underlying granite 
has been forced through it in a state of fusion, and appears 
at a spot to the eastward of Skiddaw, while another igneous 
rock, the Syenite, has been pushed upwards in such masses 
as to form the whole bulk of Carrock Fell and of High Pike. 
The slate rock is darker in colour and less cleavable than 
the more recent formations, and varies considerably in 
character and appearance in different situations, especially, 
as mentioned before, where it approaches the igneous rock 
by which it has been penetrated, when it is said to become 



metamorphic. Besides the great main deposit, this rock is 
found at the south-west corner of Cumberland, where it forms 
the mountain Blackcombe ; and also in the neighbourhood 
of Shap. It has always been held to be destitute of fossil 
remains, but we understand that these were discovered in it 
by the late Mr. Ruthven, of Kendal, to whose practical know- 
ledge of this branch of local science we are indebted for a 
very valuable Geological Map of the District, to which we 
gladly refer our readers. 

Overlying the Skiddaw Slate, we have the second, a still 
more extensive division of the great slaty formations, called 
Green Slate and Porphyry, and forming, with the exception 
of those mentioned, every mountain of importance in the 
fell country. This vast group owes its formation to the 
action of two opposite elements, fire and water, consisting 
as it does, of Plutonic masses, of various structure, alter- 
nated and interblended with large deposits of aqueous rock, 
possessing more or less of the properties of slate. The pre- 
vailing colour of this slate, when not affected by igneous 
influences, is, as its name imports, chiefly a fine light green. 
That after, and probably during its formation, it has under- 
gone a succession of the most inconceivable convulsions is 
evident, from the frequent distortion of its stratification, the 
wild and rugged character of its crags and precipices, and 
the altitude of some portions over others in the same vicinity. 
Scafell Pikes, for instance, rising nearly three thousand feet 
above the bed of Wastwater. It is also said to contain few 
or no fossils, and abounds supereminently in beautiful and 
valuable mineral- productions, as will be shewn hereafter. 
Besides the main deposit of the green slate to the south, a 
considerable extent of it occupies the northern borders of 
the older rock, lying between that and the Carboniferous 
series. 



35^ ©eologg. 

Granite and Syenite. — Granite^ varying in colour and 
composition, is protruded through the Green Slate and 
Porphyry in large masses in Eskdale, Wastdale, and Was- 
dale Crags, near Shap. From these Granite rocks have been 
derived most of the erratic boulders distributed over the 
north of England, as far east as the sea-coast, and as far 
south as Staffordshire. In Peel Park, at Manchester, an 
institution worth visiting, is a large mass of granite bearing an 
inscription which purports that it was found in that neigh- 
bourhood, whither it had been brought, by the operations 
of nature, from the parent rock near Ravenglass, in Cum- 
berland. It is now generally agreed that, at a period very 
remote, when the climate was much colder, and most of this 
country was submerged by the sea, the lake mountains form- 
ing a rugged island, these detached masses of stone were 
borne away from their native beds enclosed in ice, and 
dropped in the situations where they now occur. The 
beautiful stone called Syenite, is protruded through the green 
slate, as well as through the earlier rock, on both sides of 
Ennerdale and extending eastward from that lake to Butter- 



The Coniston Limestone extends along the south-east 
border of the great middle deposit of slate-rock, with many 
breaks and twists, from Millom, by Coniston and Winander- 
mere, across High Furness and part of Westmorland, to 
Shap Fells. This represents the Coniston Limestone, a 
formation which excites much interest amongst geologists 
from being the line of division between two great systems, 
and from containing fossil remains in great abundance and 
variety, which may be obtained with little trouble where the 
rock is exposed above the farm of Dixon Ground, in Church 
Coniston. Its numerous * faults ' and dislocations shew that 



©eologg. 353 

it also has suffered very violent treatment from the subter- 
ranean forces ; and these displacements are especially obvious 
where it crosses the valleys; for instances, Winandemiere 
and the vale of the Kent. 

Brathay Flags. — Superimposed again upon the Lime- 
stone is a group of similar course and extent called Coniston, 
or Brathay Flags, which consists mainly of a dark, almost 
black, stone easily worked into flags. The manner in which 
the line of cleavage in most of these rocks runs across the 
line of deposit is well demonstrated in this flagstone, and 
may be studied to advantage in the roadside wall on the 
high-way from Ambleside to Coniston, as it passes through 
the enclosures above Brathay, where these lines are seen 
very plainly as well as divisions running parallel to the line 
of deposit, and containing brilliant incrustations of Iron 
Pyrites, which appear upon the edges of the stones used in 
building the wall. The rock also preserves a few remains 
of organic life. Remarkable displacements of these two 
formations, and sometimes of the next, are exhibited as in 
Low Furness, Ravonstonedale, and the vicinity of Ingleton. 

Coniston Grit. — Upon the Flagstone rests, in its turn, 
a formation called Coniston Grit, or Hard Grit, a coarse, 
hard, tenacious stone, whose structure has enabled it to resist 
the disturbing forces more successfully than most of its 
neighbours. A similar rock occurs on Howgill Fells and in 
the country at Sedbergh, towards Kirkby Lonsdale. It has 
also been hoisted up by enormous disruptions of the car- 
boniferous strata, so as to form the summits of Ingleborough 
and other hills in that direction. 

Ireleth Slate. — The Coniston Grit forms the base of 
the third great system of Slate Rock, called Ireleth, now 

Y 



354 .^eol0S2, 

Bannisdale or Bretherdale Slate, reaching from Ravenstone- 
dale to Duddon Sands, and from Morecambe Bay to Win- 
dermere Village and Hawkshead. It consists of masses of 
dark slate intersected and broken by bands of quartz and 
beds of grit and limestone. Unlike the other two great 
slate divisions, it has formed no hills of any magnitude, 
though it has been greatly disturbed and contorted, and con- 
tains a considerable part of the lakes of Winander, Esth- 
waite, and Coniston. A few fossils are found in it, and it is 
perforated frequently by dykes of igneous rock. 

KiRKBY Moor Flags. — Another formation of slatestone, 
called Hay Fell, or Kirkby Moor Flags, occupies the line of 
country between Kendal and Kirkby Lonsdale, and consists 
of flagstones varying in structure and* colour, and mingled 
irregularly with grit and other rocks. This group affords 
great numbers of fossils, and is also extensively perforated 
by basaltic and porphyrytic dykes. 

Old Red Sandstone. — The most considerable patches 
of Old Red Sandstone and Conglomerate occur near Shap 
and on the Cumberland side of the lower reach of Ullswater, 
forming the fells in the former locality, and the hills of Dun- 
mallet and Mell Fell in the latter. These formations owe 
their origin to attrition by the sea of the earlier rocks ; the 
cohesion of the coarse fragments constituting the stone 
called Conglomerate, and that of the fine particles, the 
Sandstone. This, and their position, as related to the slate- 
rock, prove that these deposits were formed at a period sub- 
sequent, not only to the formation of the slate groups, but 
also to the disruption by the great Plutonic influences, — a 
striking demonstration of the antiquity of these vast systems. 
Unlike the Old Red Sandstone of other parts of Britain, 
that of the Lake District is said to exhibit no fossil remains. 



©colosS- 355 

Carboniferous Series. — The Great central formations 
we have noticed are engirdled by an almost complete circle, 
representing the important series of rock called Carboni- 
ferous, which includes the coal measures and the extensive 
limestone deposits of the country. These have been ar- 
ranged in several groups, one of calcareous stone, rich in 
animal remains ; another consisting of beds of limestone 
and sandstone, and beds of coal and shale ; a third of grit 
and other stone with little lime, but considerable quantities 
of coal ; and lastly the rich coal fields of West Cumberland. 
These vast formations occupy what was the ancient coast 
line when the district was insular, and during the periods of 
deposit and induration, must have undergone considerable 
changes of elevation and arrangement. 

New Red Sandstone, &c. — Magnesian Limestone and 
Conglomerate are found in a few localities, one near White- 
haven, another near Rosley ; and immediately underlie a very 
extensive deposit, namely. New Red Sandstone, which 
occupies a wide field, over, and external to, the Carboni- 
ferous series, ranging from Kirkby Stephen to Maryport, and 
from Whitehaven, across the Duddon, to Low Furness and 
Cartmel. This being the most recent formation, we close 
with it our sketch of the Geology of the Lakes, which, short 
and imperfect as it is, we consider sufficient to accomplish 
the object stated at the beginning, and more in accordance 
with the plan and purpose of this work, than if the subject 
had been treated in a manner more worthy of the rank it 
holds as a branch of physical science. The mineral pro- 
ductions of the district will be noticed separately.

ECONOMIC MINERALOGY. 
It is supposed, and on good grounds, that the Mineral 
treasures of the Lake Country have been made available to 
the purposes of life, in war, in the arts, and in commerce, 
for something like two thousand years; and there is also 
reason to believe that of these the earliest made use of by 
the primeval inhabitants of this country was — 

Copper. — The Copper Mines of Coniston therefore may 
be held to be the most ancient works of the kind north of 
Cornwall ; and some idea of the enormous extent to which 
the ores of this metal have been deposited originally in the 
Coniston Fells may be deduced from the fact that, though 
these mines have been wrought almost incessantly for so 
many centuries, at no earlier period have such quantities of 
ore been obtained as of late years. At present, and for a 
long time past, the copper ore transmitted from Coniston 
averages three hundred tons per month, and the ore exposed 
is sufficient to maintain this rate for many years yet to come. 
It occurs almost entirely in the form of sulphuret, though 
considerable quantities of different oxides, and traces of sul- 
phate, carbonate or malachite, phosphate, and even pure 
malleable copper have been found in various parts of the 
workings. The ore is deposited in the green slate and por- 
phyry rock in * veins, lodes, and cross courses,' and is gener- 
ally embedded in a matrix of quartz. The extreme hardness 
of the rock and the vast extent and depth of the mines ren- 
der the process of obtaining and dressing the ore very labo- 
rious and costly ; and it is entirely due to able management 
that the great prosperity of these copper mines has been 



X^fntineralogg* 357 

secured and maintained for so long a period by the present 
proprietary. Deposits of Copper, small in extent, are scat- 
tered nearly all over the second division of the slate-rock, 
and mining operations in search of it have been instituted 
and carried on for longer and shorter periods, and with more 
or less success, in many different localities, as Torver, Sea- 
thwaite, Ulpha, Eskdale, Newlands, Caldbeck, Wythburn, 
Langdale &c., but, with the exception of those in Newlands 
and Langdale, it is probable that none of these have been 
wrought of late to any advantage. 

On account of its antiquity, precedence has been accorded 
to Copper in this notice of Minerals of the Lake District ; 
but that metal is far from standing first amongst our mineral 
productions in point of quantity exported, — in this respect 
it is far exceeded by coal, slate, iron, and probably by lead. 

Coal. — From the Coalfield of West Cumberland there 
was exported, in 1857, coal to the amount of 673,000 tons, 
chiefly to Ireland ; and home consumption exceeding 200,000 
tons. Adding to these figures 100,000 tons for the produce 
of the East Cumberland Collieries, we have a total, in round 
numbers, of 1,000,000 tons, given, at seven shillings per ton, 
^^350,000 as the annual value of the coal fields in our West 
Cumberland map. The colliery at Whitehaven is very ex- 
tensive, the excavations having been carried for miles be- 
yond low-water mark, under the bed of the sea. This was 
the case also at Workington, where, in 1837, through the 
criminal temerity of an agent, who perished, though warned 
by the old workmen, in removing the pillars of coal left to 
support the roof of the mine — the sea broke in and filled 
the whole of the works, destroying many lives, and property 
to the value of ;^i 20,000. This mineral is deposited in 
' seams or bands ' varying greatly in quality and thickness —

and also in depth — * some creeping out' at the surface and 
others lying at an unknown distance below it. 

Iron. — The mineral of the district next, or perhaps equal 
in value to coal, is iron, the ore of which metal is found in 
great abundance in Furness, and in West Cumberland, in 
the district lying immediately north of Egremont, and also 
in more limited quantity, in Millom, Eskdale, and other 
localities. In 1857, the iron mines in Low Furness yielded 
ore to the amount of 560,000 tons, and in the same period 
there were drawn from the Cumberland mines about 198,000 
making the yield in the whole district, say, 758,000 tons. 
It occurs chiefly in the form of a red oxide, and is deposited 
in masses, varying greatly in dimensions, in the cavities of 
the limestone rock of the country. It is occasionally found 
close to the surface, but more frequently at considerable 
depths. Another form in which iron occurs in the district 
is that of sulphuret, or iron pyrites. This is nowhere worked 
for profit now, though it is widely diffused throughout the 
great green slate and some other formations, and large quanti- 
ties exist in the waste heaps of the Coniston mines. It is found 
also in the carboniferous series, amongst the Cumberland 
coal measures, especially at Harrington, where it was lately 
used in the manufacture of certain chemicals. Iron occurs 
also as a magnetic oxide, and in various other combinations, 
the most interesting of which is that known by the popular 
name of wad, blacklead, or plumbago. This is found only 
in Borrowdale, and is one of the multitude of valuable 
minerals deposited in the green slate-rock, in which it lies in 
irregular heaps or ' sops.' Statistics of this mineral are not 
procurable, indeed, the wad mine has not been worked for 
some years, but has recently been re-opened. It is generally 
known at the present day that the name blacklead is erro- 



XlEimeralosg^ 359 

neous. The substance so called being carburet of iron, 
consisting of the same elements as steel, but with the pro- 
portions of these reversed — the one being formed of iron, 
with a small percentage of carbon of charcoal, and the 
other of carbon, with a small percentage of iron. 

Lead. — No mineral production is so universally distri- 
buted throughout the hill-country as lead. There is scarcely 
a valley or even a hill that does not exhibit some indication 
of the presence of this metal. Like copper, it has its chief 
habitat in the green slate-rock, but it occurs also in other 
formations. Of the numerous lead mines in the country 
those at Greenside, in Patterdale, setting aside Alston as out 
of our range, are by far the most extensive and successful. 
For many years large quantities of lead and a considerable 
amount of silver have been obtained from these mines ; the 
ore being the common sulphuret, holding in combinations, 
besides silver, various other substances, the most important 
of these being arsenic. Contrary to the custom at the other 
great mines of the district, the ores are smelted and sepa- 
rated on the spot ; the silver being taken out by a very simple 
and ingenious process, the principle of which depends upon 
the different temperatures at which the two metals are fusible, 
while the arsenic is separated by sublimation, the fumes be- 
ing condensed in long chimneys which run up the sides of 
the mountains. It may be remembered that an eminent 
Scottish professor nearly perished by suffocation in 1857, 
from having broken into one of these chimneys while 
ascending Helvellyn. As at Coniston, the excavations in 
Patterdale are all at considerable elevations, with the dif- 
ferent workings at different altitudes ; as there also the ore is 
embedded in very hard rock, so much so that we have 
heard one of the managers say that the softest material his 
men had to penetrate was flint. 



360 X3£lmeralci02* 

Slate. — A very important source of employment and 
enterprize in the Lake District exists in the slate-quarries, 
the most extensive of which now in operation are in an im- 
portant displacement of the Brathay flag-rock at Kirkby- 
Ireleth. The slate obtained in this formation is of a dark 
colour, whilst that quarried from the middle slate-rock at 
Coniston, Langdale, Rydal, and other places is of a pale 
green hue ] the most beautiful of all, and which always 
commands the readiest market, being got from a quarry at 
Hodge Close, in Tilberthwaite. The tourist passing through 
the Langdales and Tilberthwaite to Coniston will be struck 
with the enormous heaps of debris indicating the positions of 
abandoned slate-works; and the caverns and galleries in 
some of these will amply repay the trouble of inspection. 
On the eastern and southern sides of Coniston Old Man 
too are numerous waste heaps, shewing where slate of fine 
quaUty was obtained formerly. Operations have been 
renewed in some of these works, but only upon a limited 
scale. At an abandoned quarry on Walna Scar, slate and 
flags were obtained beautifully striated with broad ribbon- 
like marks, crossing the cleavage-line and showing how the 
slate-rock was originally formed by successive layers of 
aqueous deposit. These may be examined by the tourist 
descending into the vale of Duddon from Coniston, in the 
heap of slate debris lying a little to the left of the road about 
half way down Walna Scar, just before entering the first 
large enclosure. The slate-works in the stupendous preci- 
pice called Honister Crag, also in the green-slate rock, are 
remarkable for their altitude above the pass leading from 
Borrowdale to Butter mere, and from the manner of bringing 
the slate down upon sledges, which was also practised at 
Coniston. 

It is scarcely requisite to notice the flags, lime, marble, 



XMlineralogg. 361 

gypsum, millstones, grindstones, &c., of the country, as these 
though eminently useful, are of little interest to the philo- 
sophic, the poetic, or the practical tourist. Several metallic 
ores are scattered through the hills, though not in quantity 
sufficient to render them of commercial importance, and 
amongst these may be mentioned zinc, antimony, cobalt, 
aluminium, barium, and gold ; whilst of the precious stones 
the garnet, agate, and jasper are found in the Borrow dale 
and Wastdale fells, the two latter pretty abundantly on the 
beach at St. Bees and Fleswick. 

In conclusion it may be mentioned that, as no district 
of similar extent displays such a variety of natural beauties 
in its external aspect, so does no district present, within 
equally limited bounds, such diversity of geological forma- 
tion and arrangement, or a like variety of mineral produc- 
tions, as does the Lake Country of England.

HOTELS AND LODGINGS 

During the season, which extends from May to Novem- 
ber, the charges are two shillings and sixpence for breakfast 
(including meat, fish, &c.) ; three shilHngs and sixpence for a 
soup and joint dinner; and one shilling and sixpence for a 
plain tea. A private sitting-room is charged from three shil- 
lings and sixpence per day, according to its quality. In 
most cases servants are charged in the bill, one shilling and 
sixpence per day. 

The charges for Private Apartments of a very good order, 
are from twelve to twenty-five shillings per week for each 
room, which includes attendance. Sitting-room fire and the 
use of kitchen fire are extras. 



TRAVELLING. 

During the season, the charges for Carriages and Drivers 
are uniform, all over the District. It is probable that at 
other times there may be some little diversity, depending on 
the amount of custom ; but the traveller may rely on the 
prices here given as a safe rule. 

It must be understood that the drivers of the country cars 
and other vehicles are dependent on the payment they re- 
ceive from travellers. The innkeepers charge for the 
carriage and horses only ; and the payment of the driver is 



366 5I?ta&£lltng ©Ti^arges* 

therefore an established one, and not considered dependent 
on the pleasure of the traveller. The rate is threepence per 
mile outwards, — the return journey not being charged for. 
Another way, in which I have myself been accustomed to 
pay, is one shilling for the first, and sixpence per hour, or 
fraction of an hour, afterwards. If excursions occupy a day, 
or several days, the driver's pay is six shillings per day. 

The charge for a one-horse conveyance is one shilling per 
mile outwards, and, if a return journey, sixpence per mile 
back. For a two-horse one shilling and sixpence per mile, 
and half rate for return. 

For conveyance to a certain point there is no charge for 
food for man and horse ; but if there is any waiting at the end 
of the drive, in order to return, the feed of the horses and 
the driver's dinner will amount to about five shillings and 
sixpence. The hire of a single-horse conveyance for one 
day is twenty shillings, and the driver's pay of six shillings 
makes it twenty-six shillings a-day, exclusive of the feed. 

The Tolls are invariably charged to the traveller. 

As the Times of Departure of Coaches are frequently 
changed, the tourist is recommended to provide himself with 
Garnctfs Time Tables^ published monthly, which may be had 
of the principal Booksellers in the Lake District. Coach 
fares are about threepence per mile outside, and fourpence- 
halfpenny per mile inside. 

The Routes of the Coaches are — (i) between Winder- 
mere Railway Station, Ambleside, Grasmere, and Keswick, 
over which line several run daily during the season. — (2) 
Bowness and Keswick. — (3) Bowness and Patterdale. —
