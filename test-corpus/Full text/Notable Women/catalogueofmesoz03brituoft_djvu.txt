PREFACE 



The principal source of the fine series of Jurassic plants 
from the Yorkshire Coast, now preserved in the British 
Museum, was the collection of the late Mr. William Bean, 
of Scarborough, acquired by purchase in 1859. Only 
a portion of this collection, however, is in the British 
Museum, the remainder being in the Yorkshire Philo- 
sophical Society's Museum at York. 

Mr. Bean was an enthusiastic collector, and by means 
of his vast store of duplicate fossil plants he was able to 
make exchanges with many foreign museums. Specimens 
bearing labels in his well-known handwriting also exist 
in museums and private collections all over Britain. 

A former resident of Scarborough, Dr. Murray, also gave 
many specimens to the British Museum in the early days, 
from Gristhorpe Bay and elsewhere along the Yorkshire 
coast. 

The plant-bearing Oolitic shales of Yorkshire are much 
more friable than those of the Coal-measures. This may 
possibly explain the difficulty experienced in some instances 
in identifying 'types,' many of the specimens having been 
broken up and their parts separated, or even destroyed, by 
time and frequent removals. 

The Oolitic plant-remains of Yorkshire are of peculiar 
interest, many of them having been carefully studied by

accomplished a botanist as Mr. A. C. Seward has now 
undertaken to Catalogue the Collection in the Geological 
Department which has remained for so long a time without 
a historian.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 



Specimens of Jurassic plants from Gristhorpe Bay and 
other famous localities on the Yorksliire coast are met 
with in nearly every Museum in Britain, as well as in 
several continental collections. I have endeavoured to 
supplement the data afforded by the specimens in the 
British Museum by examining collections in other places : 
frequent allusion will be found in the descriptive part of 
this Catalogue to important types in provincial or continental 
museums. The Museums of Cambridge, Oxford, York, 
Scarborough, Whitb}', Manchester, Newcastle, and Leeds 
are rich in Yorkshire Coast plants, and good collections 
have been examined also in Paris, Stockholm, Lund, and 
elsewhere. The British Museum series and the Leckenby 
Collection in the Geological Museum, Cambridge, are 
probably the richest in large and well-preserved specimens, 
but the other museums, especially those of Scarborough, 
Whitby, York, and Manchester, contain much material of 
considerable value. The identification of type-specimens 
has often been a difficult task : some of the specimens 
are probably lost ; many have suffered considerably, partly 
through insufficient care having been exercised in their 
preservation and, to some extent, as the result of the 
natural breaking up of the shale in which the fossils 
occur. My search for type-specimens, which has often been 



VIU AUTHOR S PREFACK. 

fruitless, has afforded a practical demonstration of the 

need of some system for the centralization and cataloguing 

of all specimens, which have served for the diagnosis or 

illustration of new species. 

I desire to convey my hearty thanks to those in charge 

of the museums I have visited for their kindness in affording 

me every facility in the examination of collections, and for 

their willingness to assist my work in various ways. Among 

continental friends who have aided me I wish to express 

ray gratitude to Professor Nathorst, who generously placed 

at my disposal some unpublished drawings of specimens 

collected by himself ; also to Dr. Renault and Professor 

Zeiller, of Paris, who enabled me to obtain access to the 

Jurassic plants under their charge. 

My thanks are due to Miss Woodward for the care with 

which she has executed the drawings published in this 

volume ; to my wife I am also indebted for some of the 

drawings reproduced in the text, which were made from 

specimens in the museums of Whitby, Scarborough, and 

York. The photograph reproduced in Text-figure 34 was 

kindly taken for me by Mr. Gepp, of the Botanical 

Department. 

The Councils of the Royal Society and the Literary and 

Philosophical Society of Manchester have allowed me to 

borrow process-blocks originally used in their publications, 

and the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press 

generously gave me permission to use several blocks in 

their possession.

ENGLAND. 



The Jurassic plant-bearing strata exposed in the cliff Bections 
of the Yorkshire coast, between Whitby and a few miles south 
of Scarborough, have afforded unusually rich data towards a 
restoration of the characteristics and composition of a certain 
facies of Mesozoic vegetation. The abundance of specimens in 
European museums and the descriptions of several British species in 
the works of Brongniart, Sternberg, Zigno, and other Continental 
palaeobotanists, bear testimony to the wealth of material obtained 
from these Inferior Oolite rocks. The following passage from the 
first volume of Schimper's Traits de paUontologie vegetale illustrates 
the importance, which this eminent palaeobotanist attached to the 
investigation of the English Jurassic flora: — " On ne saurait assez 
recommander aux paleontologistes anglais I'etude approfondie de la 
flore fossUe de I'oolithe de Yorkshire. C'est une des flores les 
plus interessantes, a cause de sa grande ressemblance avec la flore 
de la formation rhetique et du lias inferieur et 4 cause de son 
rapport avec la flore cretacee. Les descriptions et les figures que 
nous en possedons sont insuffisantes pour arriver 4 une delimitation 
rigoui-euse des genres et des especes. Aussi ai-je du passer sous 
silence un certain nombre de ces demieres faute de donnees exactes." * 
In the present volume an attempt is made to describe in detail 
the several elements composing the Jurassic flora of East Yorkshire, 
and to furnish a general sketch of the geographical distribution 
and botanical affinities of the vegetation represented by the Lower 
Oolite plants of this area.

Historical Sketch. 



We may begin ^ this brief historical survey of our knowledge 
of the Jurassic plants of Yorkshire with a reference to the well- 
known memoir by Young & Bird — A Geological Survey of the 
Yorkshire Coast,^ published at Whitby in 1822. Mr. John Bird 
was Curator of the Whitby Museum, and the Rev. G. Young 
acted as one of the Secretaries of the Whitby Literary and 
Philosophical Society. The first part of this work deals with the 
geological structure of the strata which are described under various 
heads, such as the upper shales, oolitic limestone, second shale, 
ironstone and sandstone, blue limestone, sandstone, shale and 
coal, and Dogger; but most of these descriptive terms have not 
been adhered to by later geologists. In the second part a brief 
description is attempted of the organic remains, a few fossil plants 
being represented by crude coloured drawings ; the type-specimens 
are preserved in the Whitby Museum, and a recent examination 
of the collection enabled me to identify most of the originals of 
Bird's figures. The second edition of the Geological Survey 
of the Yorkshire Coast, which appeared in 1828, contains various 
additional drawings of fossil plants.^ The plants are compared 
with several recent genera such as Asplenium, Scolopendrium, 
Mippuris, Cynaria, Gnaphalium, and others, or they are merely 
spoken of as fragments of ferns or leaves. Reference is made to 
the figures of Young & Bird in the description of several species 
dealt with in the following pages. 

It has been truly said that " Young & Bird's work did much 
to arouse the desire for geological pursuits, which eventually led 
to the establishment of the Museums at Whitby and Scarborough, 
and to the formation of such collections of fossils as were made 
by Bean, Williamson, and others." * The enthusiasm of these and 
other local naturalists resulted in the accumulation of rich col- 
lections, and, indeed, nearly the whole of the material at present

literature vide also Phillips (75), Fox-Strangways (88), etc.

available for the study of the fossil flora of East Yorkshire Tvas 
obtained by their means. It is to be regretted that very little 
serious collecting has been undertaken during the last half-century ; 
some of the famous localities which afforded so rich a harvest sixty 
or seventy years ago are probably almost worked out, but there is 
undoubtedly much valuable material to be found if local enthusiasm 
were again aroused. William Bean and his nephew John Williamson 
rendered excellent service in the early days of the geological 
exploration of the Yorkshire coast : the characteristic handwriting 
of the former is met with in most of oui" Museums on the labels 
of Yorkshire fossil plants ; the latter began life as a gardener at 
Scarborough,' and afterwards became Curator of the Scarborough 
Museum, which owes many of its treasures to his skill as a scientific 
collector. John Williamson in later life was assisted in his natural- 
history work by his son William Crawford Williamson, whose 
brilliant palaeobotanical researches date from his boyish days, when 
his father's zeal led him to take a share in interpreting the 
records of Jurassic life. The elder Williamson was acquainted 
with William Smith, whose name will always be prominently 
associated with Jurassic geology,- and with Smith's nephew, John 
Phillips, whose work on the Yorkshire Coast is one of the English 
classics. Adolphe Brongniart ' was at this period engaged on his 
famous work on the history of fossil plants, and as the recognized 
authority received various Yorkshire specimens for identification, 
some of which he figured and described. 

The following list includes the East Yorkshire species described 
by Brongniart in 1828 : —

Phillips' Illustrations of the Geology of Yorkshire was publisbed 
in 1829, dedicated by an " affectionate nephew and grateful pupil " 
to "William Smith. Phillips' book marked an important advance 
on that of Young & Bird, and placed the geology of East 
Yorkshire on a sound scientific basis ; he included the plant- 
bearing strata in the "Bath Oolite formation," the term Oolite 
having been first applied to these rocks by Smith. The strata 
are classified by Phillips as follows: — 

r Combrasti limestone. 

I Upper sandstone, shale and coal, with plants, 
Bath Oolite \ Impure limestone. 

I Lower sandstone, shale and coal, with plants. 
V Ferruginous beds — Dogger Series. 

In the first edition of Phillips' work the respective positions of 
the grey limestone and millepore bed are confused, so that the 
Gristhorpe plant - bed,^ which is now included in the middle 
estuarine series, was placed in the upper division.^ This mistake was 
first pointed out by the late Professor Williamson,^ and corrected 
in the later edition of Phillips' book. Phillips speaks of the fossil 



1 John "Williamson is usually credited with the discovery of the famous 
Gristhorpe plant-bed. In a letter written to Lindley in 1832, William Bean 
asserts that he was "the first discoverer" of this bed. (I am indebted to 
Professor Lebour for an opportunity of reading Bean's letter.)

plants as belonging chiefly to "the natural monocotvledonous 
Orders, Filices, Lycopodiaceae, Equisetaceae, and Cycadaceae," with 
associated fragments of dicotyledonous species. The plant-bearing 
sediments he describes as principally such as might be deposited by 
rivers varying in force, and subject to intervals of feebler action. 
The drawings of the plants are in many cases far from accurate, 
and it is not an easy matter to recognize the original specimens. 
Some of Phillips' type-specimens appear to have been lost, but 
others have been identified in the York Museum and elsewhere. 
In 1875 a third and much enlarged edition of Phillips' memoir was 
published under the editorship of Mr. Robert Etheridge. Professor 
Phillips did not live to see the publication of the third edition of 
his work ; the concluding paragraph of the preface, written in 
1874, the year of his death, is worthy of repetition.' 

" The Yorkshire coast has ever been my delight : to sketch 
its romantic promontories, to climb and measure its cliffs, to 
investigate its numerous fossils and its rich variety of marine life, 
may be recommended to every lover of natural beauty and to eveiy 
student of natural history. To them I bequeath what has been to 
me a labour of love, a life-long enjoyment — the study of the great 
Mesozoic section here so plainly cut, — not doubting that kindly 
thoughts will accompany the corrections and additions which time 
has brought, and still must bring, to the work which I now consign 
to their use." 

The following list includes the species enumerated in the last 
edition, together with the names used in the first edition and their 
modem equivalents adopted in the present Catalogue. I have also 
added the name of the museum where the figured specimens may 
be seen, but there are still several species of which the originals

In 1829 there also appeared an important paper by Murcliison 
On the Coalfield of Brora, in Sutherlandshire, and some of the 
stratified deposits in the North of Scotland.^ Murchison's attention 
was first called to this district by Buckland & Lyell, who visited 
Brora in 1824, and were led to express the opinion that the 
Sutherlandshire Coalfield should be included in the Oolite division 
of the Jurassic system. Konig contributed some notes on an 
equisetaceous plant, which he named Oncylogonatum carbonarium 



Murchison (29). 



INTRODUCTION. 9 

(no doubt identical with Equisetites columnaris, Brongn.), and on 
some " subtriangular or inversely cordate carbonaceous plates," 
which are probably the scales of a female Araucarian cone. In 
referring to the Brora plants, Murchison makes the following 
observation : — "If the mode of distribution and the generic 
characters of these fossil plants be ever reduced under general 
laws, they will no longer be regarded as anomalies, but will form 
an important addition to the natural history of the beds with 
which they are associated." * 

The Fossil Flora of Great Britain, by Lindley & Hutton, which 
appeared in parts between the years 1831 and 1837,* contains 
drawings and descriptive notes of several species of Jurassic 
plants ; several of these were communicated by the younger 
Williamson, and others by Bean, Murray, Dunn, and Phillips. 
There is an interesting reference in Williamson's autobiography 
to his share in the production of the Fossil Fhra. He speaks 
of Mr. Dunn, Secretary to the Literary and Philosophical Society 
of Scarborough, as having urged him to undertake the drawings, 
which were made " at one end of Mr. Weddell's kitchen-table, 
whilst the housekeeper was occupied at the other end with the 
several processes of providing the day's dinner." ' Williamson 
was at this time a medical student living in the house of 
Mr. Thomas Weddell, a practitioner in Scarborough. 

The following list includes such plants from Yorkshire as are 
figured by Lindley & Hutton. I have added the modem names, 
and mentioned the museums in which I have seen some of the 
figured specimens. The date of publication is appended in each case. *

In Williamson's papers read before the Geological Society in 
1834 and 1836,' a list is given of Oolitic plants, but one of the 
most important additions to the geology of the plant-bearing strata 
in these contributions is the correction of Phillips' mistake as to 
the horizon of the Gristhorpe plant-bed. 

An important paper was read before the Geological Society of 
London in 1851 by Bunbury,* On some Fossil Plants from the 
Jurassic Strata of the Yorkshire Coast, in which several species 
are critically discussed, and illustrated by accurate drawings ; the 
species specially referred to include the following: —

The two folio volumes by Zigno entitled Flora Fossilis 
Formationis Oolithicee, published between 1856 and 1885,' contain 
numerous references to British Jurassic plants ; these are quoted 
in the lists of synonyms of the various species dealt with in the 
Catalogue. 

In Hugh Miller's Testimony of the Hoch,^ reference is made 
to the occurrence of several plants in the Helmsdale deposits of 
Sutherlandshire' identical with Lower Oolite species from the 
Yorkshire coast. The Mesozoic flora of Scotland is in need of 
further investigation, and it is proposed to deal elsewhere with the 
botany and geology of these northern species. 

In 1864 Leckenby* described and figured "some new or 
imperfectly known species" of East Yorkshire plants ; most of the 
specimens dealt with are included in the Leckenby Collection, 
which Professor Adam Sedgwick purchased in 1872 for the 
"Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge : — *

The writings of Morris,^ Carruthers,' Starkie Gardner,' and 
others contain scattered references to descriptions of Lower Oolite 
plants ; several species of the British Jurassic flora are dealt with 
also by Saporta * in his Monograph on the plants of this period. 

The most important of the more modem contributions to our 
knowledge of the Jurassic plants of England is unfortunately- 
written in the Swedish language, and is not accompanied by any 
illustrations. In 1880 Nathorst* published a series of notes on his 
visits to various English Museums, together with observations 
made in the field at some of the principal plant localities on the 
Yorkshire coast. The same author discovered a new plant-bed 
between White Nab and Scarborough, which enabled him to add 
some new species to the Lower Oolite flora. Nathorst's notes 
have proved of considerable value in the examination of the 
Yorkshire plants, and his opinions on the several species are 
frequently referred to in the descriptive part of this Catalogue. 
The following new species are mentioned or briefly described, 
but in some cases I have been led to identify them with species 
previously recorded. Whether or not Nathorst's supposed new 
species should be retained, there can be no question as to the 
great value of his critical notes.

Among the works dealing more especially with the stratigraphy 
of the Lower Oolite rocks of Yorkshire, reference may be made 
to the Geological Survey Memoirs by Messrs. Fox-Strangways, 
Barrow,^ and H. B. "Woodward,^ and to a series of valuable papers 
by Hudleston,^ published in the Proceedings of the Geologists' 
Association, also to Etheridge's Presidential Address of 1882.* 

The second volume of the Geological Survey Memoirs on 
the Jurassic rocks of Britain, contains a long list of fossils by 
Fox-Strangways, who acknowledges assistance in the revision of 
the plants by Clement Eeid.^ As this is the most recent list 
of plants hitherto published, and is largely founded on the notes 
by Nathorst to which reference has already been made, I have 
enumerated those species from Fox-Strangways' list which are 
referred to as "species now recognized," adding in each case the 
names employed in the present Catalogue. A change of nomen-

A glance at a geological map of England reveals the existence of 
a band of Jurassic rocks stretcMng diagonally across England from 
the coast of Yorkshire to Dorsetshire in the south-west. Between 
the Yorkshire strata and those of corresponding age in the midland

and south-west districts there is a striking difference as regards 
petrological characters, thickness, and fossil contents. The sedi- 
mentary rocks in the north-eastern area consist of a considerable 
thickness of estuarine or freshwater deposits, with here and there

a thin marine band, whereas in the other districts the Lower 
Oolite rocks are almost exclusively of marine origin. The country 
between Whitby and a few miles south of Scarborough is occupied 
by Middle and Lower Oolite and Liassic strata ; the accompanying 



18 rMEODIJCTION'. 

map shows the position of the most important localities in this 
part of the coast from which Lower Oolite plants have heen 
obtained. 

The sketch-map shown in Fig. 1 is a simplified form of part of the 
larger map published in the volume of the International Geological 
Congress of 1888. "While illustrating the relation of the Estuarine 
Series of the Inferior Oolite (Bajocian) to the Middle and Upper 
Oolite and to the Cretaceous rocks, it marks the position of the 
chief localities from which the fossil plants dealt with in the 
following pages have been obtained. 

The moorlands and bold headlands of North-East Yorkshire 
constitute an elevated region which is bounded on the west by 
the low-lying Triassic plain of Central Yorkshire. Geologically 
this district is marked off from the other Jurassic areas by well- 
defined characters ; the rocks composing it are chiefly arenaceous, 
with some Oolitic limestones and ironstones and a few thin seams 
of coal. The occurrence of some subordinate marine beds affords 
evidence of the frequent oscillations of level in this part of 
England during the Jurassic period. Broadly speaking, the East 
Yorkshire rocks of Lower Oolite age consist of three important 
Estuarine Series separated from one another by thin bands con- 
taining marine fossils. The following classification illustrates the 
relative positions of these two types of sediments : — 

/'Cornbrash. 
Upper Estuarine Series. 
Scarborough or Grey Limestone Series. 
Lower Oolite. ^ Middle Estuarine Series. 
Millepore Series. 
Lower Estuarine Series. 
,The Dogger and Blea Wyke beds. 

These Lower Oolite rocks of England are correlated with part of 
the Middle or Brown Jura of Germany (L. von Buch and Quenstedt ; 
= Dogger of Oppel), and with the Bathonian and Bajocian of 
French geologists.' 

The Yorkshire Dogger, exposed in the cliff sections of Blea 
Wyke, High Whitby, Saltwick, and elsewhere, forms the lowest 
member of the Lower Oolite rocks ; it is a littoral formation,

consisting largely of rounded blocks (the so-called doggers) of 
sandstone and ironstone. 

The Lower Estuarine Series, exposed at various localities on the 
coast between Eobin Hood Bay and HuntclifE (the latter is situated 
a few miles further north than the coastline shown in the map), 
consists of a considerable thickness of arenaceous and argillaceous 
sediments, associated with beds of oolitic ironstone, thin coal-seams, 
and an abundance of carbonaceous matter. This succession of 
estuarine sediments containing plant remains is capped by a thin 
marine band known as the Eller Beck bed. This is succeeded by 
the Millepore bed, so called from the occurrence of the Polyzoan 
Haplocecia straminea ' (Phill.) ( = Mtllepora and Cricopora straminea), 
which consists of ferruginous sandstone and limestone, and is 
exposed at Cloughton Wyke in its arenaceous facies, and at Gris- 
thorpe Bay and Cayton Bay as a limestone. Above the Millepore 
bed we pass up into the second series of freshwater or estuarine 
beds, known as the Middle Eduarine Series. These deposits 
constitute the principal coal-bearing series in the Inferior Oolite, 
and include the famous plant -bed of Gristhorpe Bay. From the 
Middle Estuarine rocks a certain amount of jet has been obtained ; 
but most of the well-known Whitby jet is of Upper Liassic age. 

Another marine intercalation, the Scarborough or Grey Limestone 
Series, rests on the Middle Estuarine beds ; these blue and grey 
limestones, exposed ia the cliffs at Cloughton Wyke, form the most 
important marine development in the Yorkshire Oolites. Resting 
on the Scarborough limestones there is a third succession of fresh- 
water strata, known as the Upper Estuarine Series, consisting of 
hard siliceous rocks, sandstones, shales, and ironstones, including 
much carbonaceous matter. Some species of plants have been 
obtained from sandstone strata in the lower part of this third 
Estuarine Series, which occupies nearly the whole of the moorlands 
of the East Yorkshire area. 

At the summit of the Inferior OoHte we have the Cornbrash, 
so named by William Smith, which is made up of calcareous beds 
containing abundant marine fossils, and is exposed in the Ca)i;on 
and Gristhorpe Bay sections.

20 INTRODTTCTIOIir. 

The conditions under which, the estuarine sediments of the 
Yorkshire area were laid down are briefly dealt with in the con- 
cluding pages of the Catalogue. As the present volume deals only 
with the Inferior Oolite plants of East Yorkshire, the consideration 
of the Stonesfield flora and of other Oolitic plants recorded from 
various British localities is reserved for the second volume of the 
Jurassic Flora Catalogue. 



JURASSIC PLANT-BEARING STRATA OF FRANCE, 
GERMANY, AND OTHER COUNTRIES. 

The following incomplete account of extra-British Jurassic plant- 
bearing strata is intended to draw attention to the principal floras, 
v^hich present a more or less close resemblance to that facies of 
Jurassic vegetation represented by the plants from the Yorkshire 
coast. In the following lists of plants the right-hand column is 
intended to illustrate the resemblance or possible identity of British 
species with species described fiom other countries ; a more detailed 
comparison may be found in the descriptive part of the Catalogue. 



FRANCE. 

One of the earliest notices of French Jurassic plants occurs in 
a memoir by Desnoyers^ on the Oolite rocks of Mamers in the 
department of Sarthe in the north-west of France, containing a few 
notes by Brongniart on some species of fossil plants. 

Some years later Pomel ^ published a series of notes on Jurassic 
plants from several localities and horizons, and proposed a large 
number of new generic names, most of which have not been retained. 
A small number of species is enumerated also by Brongniart in 
his Prodrome^ of 1828, and in the Tableau'^ published in 1849; 
but it is in the well-known volumes by Saporta* that we find

the fullest account of the Jurassic plants of France. Some of the 
figures in Saporta's monograph are reproduced from di'a wings 
originally prepared for Brongniart, and these enable us to recognize 
certain species which are mentioned but not described in the 
Prodrome and the Tableau. Several of the specimens figured in 
Saporta's volumes are in the Museum of Natural History and 
in the School of Mines, Paris ; an examination of some of the 
type-specimens impressed upon me the need of considerable caution 
in drawing conclusions from the figures alone, many of which are 
far from accurate. In the following list only such plants are 
included as present a close resemblance to East Yorkshire species, 
or agree approximately in age with the British species. Several 
species of Sphe7iopteris, Scleropteris, Cladophlebis, and other ferns 
have been omitted, as they are often founded on fragmentaiy 
and insufficient material. Most of the strata from which the 
Jurassic plants of France have been obtained are of marine origin. 
Among the most important localities from the point of view of a 
comparison of the French and English species are Mamers 
(Bathonian), D'Etrochey (Combrash), and Chateauroux (Corallian), 
in the departments of Sarthe, Cote d'Or, and Indre respectively. 
The numerous fossils referred by Saporta to Algae need not be 
considered; they have no representatives in the Yorkshire beds, 
and most of them have in all probability no claim to be included 
in the plant kingdom.

A few species of Inferior Oolite plants have been recorded by 
Fliche & Bleicher' from strata in the neighbourhood of Nancy, 
but the fragments figured are too small to admit of accurate 
determination. 

Additions have been made to the plants from French Jurassic 
strata by Crie, who records some new species from Mamers and 
other localities. This author has also published brief notes on the 
comparison of French Jurassic plants with species from England, 
Portugal, and the Southern Hemisphere.* A fern described by 
Zeiller as Acrostichides rhombifolius, var. rarinervis, Font., from 
the Gres bigarre of Saint-Germain bears a close resemblance to 
Todites Williamsoni from the English Oolitic rocks.' 



GERMANY. 

The chief developments of Jurassic rocks in Germany are referred 
by Kayser * to three principal areas : 

1. Franko-Swabian area, forming a large curve, "one arm of 
which extends with a south-easterly strike from the region 
of Coburg to Regensburg, whilst the other stretches thence 
in a south-westerly direction to the foot of the Black 
Forest. " The passage - beds between the Keuper and

24 rNTKODUCTION. 

Liassic rocks of the north arm of this area have afforded 
a particularly rich flora, which has been described in 
detail by Schenk ^ ; this flora is referred to later. 

2. North-West Germany; from Helmstedt and Quedlinburg to 

the Teutoberger Wald. Several Wealden species have been 
described from this region.* 

3. Upper Silesian Jura. A belt thirty miles long, from Cracow 

to Kalisch. 

Kurr^ has described a few species of plants from the Swabian 
Jura, "vyhich suggest a Liassic horizon ; a few of these may be 
compared with East Yorkshire species : 

Zamites Mandelslohif'KvucT; cf. Otozamites parallelus (PYxUl.). 
Zamites gracilis, Kurr ; cf. small forms of Williamsonia pecten (Phill.). 

From the Solenhofen beds in Franconia,* which are classed with 
the Upper or White Jura, several plants have been recorded, 
especially species of conifers. 

The fossil flora of Bamberg, Bayreuth, and other localities in the 
Franconian area is one of the richest in Europe. Plants from these 
localities have been described by Sternberg, Goppert, Braun, and 
others, but it is to Schenk ^ that we owe the most complete account 
of this Rhaetic-Lias flora. Attention has been called by Braun, * 
and more recently by Nathorst, to the close agreement or even 
identity of many of the Franconian plants with species of Lower 
Oolite age from East Yorkshire. The following list includes such 
species as illustrate most clearly the marked Lower Oolitic facies 
of the Keuper and Lias flora.

AUSTKIA. 

Jurassic plants are poorly represented in the Austrian Empire. 
The well-known floras of Lunz in Lower Austria and Raibl in 
Carinthia belong to an earlier epoch, and present but few points of 
contact with the Lower Oolite flora of England. 

From Steierdorf in Banat in the south-eastern part of Hungary, 
Ettingshausen ' described a few plants in 1852; but this flora has 
been more fully dealt with by Andrae,* who recognized nine species 
as identical with Lower Oolite types from the Yorkshire coast. As 
a few only of Andrae's plants are figured it is impossible to express 
any opinion as to the identity of some of the species with Lower 
Oolite types.

In 1888 Stur'^ described several species of Jurassic plants from 
Grojec in Galicia, and more recently Eaciborski ^ has published an 
important memoir on the fossil flora of the Cracow district obtained 
from the mines of Grojec and other localities. Many of Eaciborski' s 
species are undoubtedly identical with East Yorkshire plants ; and 
the flora as a whole presents a closer agreement with that of the 
Inferior Oolite than with any other period. Eaciborski recognizes 
the correspondence between the Cracow plants and those from the 
Yorkshire coast, but from the presence of Thinnfeldia and some 
other Ehsetic types he concludes that the flora he describes is 
slightly older than the English flora.

ITALY. 

By far the most important contribution to the Mesozoic Botany 
of Italy is that by Zigno, published in parts between 1856 and 
1885.'' In a preliminary paper published in 1853, Zigno' drew 
attention to the close similarity of the recently discovered Lower 
Oolite (Bathonian) plants of the Venetian Alps with those from

Saporta' have described several species of plants from strata of 
Jurassic age, some of which are probably identical with English 
species. Several of the ' species ' founded by Saporta on extremely 
small fi'agments possess but little value as definite specific types, 
and it is impossible to form any accurate estimate of the number of 
East Yorkshire types which may be represented in the Portuguese 
flora of Jurassic age. 

Eguuetum lusitanicum, Heer, figured by Heer and Saporta, may 
be identical with Equisetites columna/ris, and Ototamites angusti- 
folius, Heer, agrees fairly closely with some of the English examples 
of Williamsonia pecten (Phill.) ; among the fragments referred by 
Saporta to Sphenopteris there are some which recall Coniopteris 
hymenophylloides and C. quinqueloba ; but it is useless to attempt 
to base any detailed comparisons on such imperfect data. 



SCANDINAVIA. 

The Rhsetic flora of Scania, in Southern Sweden, contains several 
species which are closely allied to Lower Oolite types. Nathorst's 
memoirs on the plants from Palsjo, Bjuf, Helsingborg, and other 
localities in Scania, are among the most important contributions 
to our knowledge of Lower Mesozoic floras, and they enable us 
to obtain a fairly comprehensive view of the characteristics of 
Rhaetic vegetation. Nathorst has himself drawn attention to the 
numerous points of contact between the Rhaetic flora of Sweden 
and the later flora of East Yorkshire.^ The following list includes 
such species from Nathorst's lists as best illustrate the existence 
of a Lower Oolite facies in the Swedish flora ; for further 
information regarding the Scanian plants reference must be made 
to Nathorst's memoirs, from which the following species have been 
selected : — '

BORNHOLM. 

Jurassic plants from Bomholm have long been known through the 
description of a few species by Pingel, Brongniart, Forchhammer, 
and Nathorst, but it is only recently that any complete account of 
the fossil flora of this island has been attempted. Bartholin's 
investigations '^ clearly demonstrate the occurrence of several 
Inferior Oolite species in the Bornholm fossil flora ; he concludes 
that rather less than half of the species are identical with or closely 
allied to Rhaetic plants, while about one-third agree with Inferior 
Oolite types. The species enumerated below afford strong evidence 
in favour of the existence of a well-marked Oolitic facies in the 
Bomholm flora ; in fact, I am disposed to consider that the Inferior 
Oolite types predominate over the Rhsetic and Wealden species.

The Mesozoic plants obtained from Advent Bay and Cape

of uppermost Jurassic age.^

Araucarioxylon and two species of Cedroxylon from the plant-beds 
of Green Harbour ; the specimens were originally described by 
Cramer under the generic name Pinites?

Among the Mesozoic floras of the far North the most important, 
from the point of view of the distribution of Lower Oolite species, 
is that which Heer has described from material collected by 
Czekanowski, Hartung, and others. The principal localities at 
which these Jurassic plants were discovered are Ust-Balei, in

In 1879 and 1881 Schmalhausen ' published a memoir on the 
Jura- Flora of Russia, in which he described plants from the coul- 
basin of Kusnezk in the Altai Mountains, in West Siberia, from 
the valley of the Petschora River in North-East European Russia, 
and from the lower Tunguska River in Northern Siberia. From 
these regions he recorded certain species of plants indicative of 
a Jurassic age, such as Ginkgo digitata, Cukanowakia rigida, 
Thyrsopteris prisca, Heer, and other ferns. It is, however, very 
probable, as Zeiller' has shown, that these plant-beds should be 
referred to a Permian horizon. The reasons for this conclusion 
and the correctness of Schmalhausen's determinations are discussed 
at length in Zeiller's paper.

coast of Greenland; he considers the flora to he of Rhsetic or 
Ehaetic-Lias age, hut he expresses his opinion cautiously, and 
points out that the evidence is hardly sufficient to admit of 
accurate determination of the geological horizon. Some of Hartz' 
plants are no doubt identical with Inferior Oolite species.

A few somewhat fragmentary plants have been collected by

a comparison with members of the Inferior Oolite flora of England ; 
but the specimens are hardly numerous enough and sufficiently 
well preserved to afford certain evidence of geological age. 

The plants obtained by Nansen were examined by Nathorst,* 
and compared by him with the Upper Jurassic flora of Spitzbergen. 
Among the specimens mentioned by Nathorst the most interesting 
is a leaf of Ginkgo, very similar to some of the smaller examples

of G. digitata (Brongn.), from the Yorkshire coast, which is 
referred to a new species, G. polans, Nath. ; this might perhaps 
be designated G. digitata, var. polaris. Some of the Jackson- 
Harmsworth plants have been figured in a recent paper by 
I^ewton & Teall.^ The specimens described by the latter authors 
are referred to the genera Ginkgo, Thyrsopteris, Baiera ?, Fieldenia ?, 
Podozamites ? ; but the material is insufficient to enable us to do 
more than express the opinion that the Cape Flora beds may be 
best compared with Oolitic or Wealden strata of other regions. 

Messrs. Newton & Teall have also described some plant remains 
from Cape Stephen, about twenty miles west of Cape Flora, which 
they compare with Schmalhausen's species from Petschora and 
Tunguska. It is very probable that these Franz Josef plants may, 
like Schmalhausen's, be referred to a Penuian horizon. 



NORTH AMERICA. 

1. United States. 

Fontaine's monograph on the older Mesozoic flora of Virginia 
contains several illustrations which forcibly recall Lower Oolite 
plants. It is to be regretted that the drawings of the fossils have 
not been executed in more detail ; they are often too sketchy, 
and presumably somewhat inaccurate, to enable one to feel mucli 
confidence in the nature of the plants represented. Fontaine thus 
concludes the discussion on the age and affinities of the flora : — 
"Eui'opean authors, and especially Schimper, often call attention to 
the strong resemblance between the Rhaetic and Lower Jurassic 
floras, the likeness to the Lower Oolite of England being especially 
striking. In accordance with this fact, the presence of a marked 
Jurassic element in the flora of these Mesozoic beds, both in 
Carolina and Virginia, is of itself an evidence that they cannot 
be older than Rhaetic. We are, then, I think, entitled to consider 
that the older Mesozoic flora of North Carolina and Virginia is 
most probably Rhaetic in age, and certainly not older." *

Stur ' has pointed out the close similarity between the Lunz flora 
of Austria and the Ehaetic flora of Virginia. Perhaps the most 
striking example of a type identical with, or at least very nearly 
allied to, a Lower Oolite species is afforded by some fronds referred 
by Fontaine to the genus Acrostichites. In his description of 
plants fi'om Virginia, Bunbury ^ expressed the view that as regards 
the evidence afforded by the fossil plants the strata might be 
referred with almost equal plausibility to either the Triassic or 
Jurassic series.

The numerous plants described by Fontaine in a later monograph 
on the Potomac or younger Mesozoic flora* consist for the most 
part of Wealden and other Lower Cretaceous species, but Jurassic 
forms are also represented.^ The ' Potomac flora ' of Virginia 
and Maryland is in reality made \ap of floras varying in age fi'om 
Upper Jurassic to the upper members of the Lower Cretaceous, 
and does not represent a single flora marking one definite geological 
horizon. It is unnecessary to attempt a detailed analysis of the 
species described by Fontaine. Several of the plants agree with 
European "Wealden types, others point to a higher horizon, and 
there are a certain number which may be compared with Lower 
Oolite species. It is very difficult to institute any exact comparison 
between the Virginian and the East Yorkshire plants without 
access to the specimens themselves ; the illustrations in Fontaine's 
monograph hardly do justice to the rich material, and the excessive

of the elements of these two floras renders their separation a matter

INDIA. 

It has long been recognized that some of the Upper Gondwana 
floras of India present several features in common with European 
Jurassic floras. Feistmantel and others have identified various 
plants of the Kach and other Indian floras with Lower Oolite 
species from East Yorkshire, hut it is very probable that the 
correspondence between these widely separated floras has been 
rather underestimated than exaggerated. Eossil plants of the 
Kach (Umia) flora were first described by Morris ^ in Captain Grant's 
Geology of Cutch, published in 1840, and in more recent years 
numerous species have been described by FeistmanteP and 
others,^ The Jabalpur flora, so called from the town of Jabalpur, 
also contains several elements of a marked Lower Oolite facies. 
Both the Jabalpur and the Umia floras appear to be approximately 
of the same age ; in the recent edition of the Geology of India * 
the latter is compared with the Middle and the former with the 
Upper Oolite. Several species of the Eajmahal flora also bear 
a striking resemblance to East Yorkshire types; this flora has 
been referred to the Liassic period. 

In the following list are included such species as appear to be 
identical with or at least closely allied to British Inferior Oolite 
types ; a more detailed comparison is made in several instances 
in the descriptive part of the Catalogue : —

AUSTRALIA. 

A valuable summary and critical review of the " Fossil Flora 
of Australia," by Dr. Feistmantel, was published in 1890 by the 
Department of Mines, New South Wales.'' This work, which was 
based on a memoir previously published in the Faleeontographica 
(1878-79), contains a comprehensive historical sketch of palaeo- 
botanical literature relating to Australia, and a revised list of 
fossil plants from various geological horizons.

Since the publication of Feistmantel's work several species of 
Queensland plants have been recorded by Jack 8c Etheridge ^ 
in their Geology of Queensland and New Guinea. More recently 
specimens have been collected by the staff of the Geological 
Survey, and some of these are described by Shirley* in a paper 
contained in Bulletin No. 7 of the Queensland Geological Survey. 
Some of the species of Ginkgo and Baiera instituted by this author 
are founded on imperfect specimens hardly worthy of being raised 
to the rank of type -specimens. Among the leaves referred to 
these two genera there are some examples which bear a fairly 
close resemblance to Baiera gracilis, Bunb., e.g. Ginkgo bidens 
(Ten.- Woods) and Baiera ipsviciensis, Shir. A fragment named 
Dictyophyllum Bremerense may be compared with D. rugosum, 
L. & H., and a leaf figured as Sagenopteris rhoifolia recalls 
S. PhilUpsi (Brongn.). The specimens described as Beania 
geminata afford little or no evidence of generic identity with 
Carruthers' genus. Some of the fossils figured by these authors 
are referred to in the descriptive part of the Catalogue.

DESCRIPTION^ OF SPECIMENS. 



In the descriptive part of tliis Catalogue the species are grouped, 
as far as possible, ia accordance with their natural affinities. Some 
of the genera are discussed at length, but in the majority of cases 
reference must be made to the two volumes on the Wealden Flora ' 
for an account of the history and application of generic names, as 
also for definitions of Families and Classes. Several of the specimens 
are from the collection of William Bean, and these usually bear 
a label with his determination. Bean's names are often quoted in 
the description of the specimens as occasionally throwing light 
on the current use in his day of various specific names ; but, on 
the other hand, it is necessary to exercise considerable caution in 
attaching importance to the determinations of this enthusiastic 
collector. The localities are, in many cases, too vague to serve as 
guides to the exact horizon from which the plants were obtained ; 
we frequently find nothing more than "near Scarborough," "near 
"Whitby," " Scarborough," etc., indicating that, as a rule, the 
necessity of gi\'ing accurate information as to the position of the 
beds had not been realized. 

In several instances the difficulty of determination has been 
considerable, owing to the constantly recurring question as to the 
advisability of uniting a series of specimens under one specific 
name or of emphasizing the existence of slight differences by the 
use of distinct names. It frequently happens that the examination 
of the material in a single collection leads to the view that certain 
forms are specifically distinct ; but the abundance of specimens in 
several museums often supplies transitional forms which render 



Seward (94 >} (95). 



44 DESCEIPTION OF SPECIMENS. 

specific separation too artificial. In cases where we have a large 
number of forms constituting a series, and the extreme types 
exhibit marked distinctive features, it has been found convenient 
to use a specific term in a comprehensive sense, and to append 
a second name as indicative of a ' form ' or variety. The species 
Sagenopteris Phillipsi (Brongn.), as used in this sense, includes 
leaves or leaflets differing considerably from one another in size 
and shape ; but from the analogy of recent plants, and from the 
occurrence of more or less connecting links between the extreme 
types, it seems preferable to include all under one term, and to 
refer to the more distinct forms by varietal names, which in some 
cases may have been previously used as specific designations. The 
small form of Sagenopteris named by Lindley & Hutton S. cuneata 
may be spoken of as S. Phillipsi, var. cuneata, while a few 
examples of unusually large leaves are referred to as S. Phillipsi, 
var. major. 

My tendency has been to diminish the number of specific names 
in cases where the data afford insufficient evidence of important 
differences. It would reduce specific distinctions to an absui'dity 
to designate by a special name the various forms of cycadean or 
fern leaves which may be grouped around a well-marked type. At 
best the material is insufficient for accurate diagnosis and deter- 
mination; and while drawing attention to such forms as afford 
valuable evidence in the recognition of geological horizons, our 
chief aim should be to deal with the fossil specimens on the same 
principles as are applied to recent plants, and to interpret the 
botanical records in a manner best calculated to render them useful 
as indices of plant development and distribution. 

In a letter to Lyell in 1860, Darwin wrote : " How far to lump 
and split species is, indeed, a hopeless problem. It must in the 
end, I think, be determined by mere convenience." ^ 

In the description of each species a definition is given after the 
list of synonyms, and where possible the locale of the type-specimen 
has been mentioned. Comparisons of the fossil types with recent 
plants are, for the sake of uniformity, usually discussed at the end 
of the remarks on the synonymy or history of each species.

passage from an impublished letter.

48 ALG^. 



Group THALLOPHYTA. 
Class ALG^. 

The few specimens described as Algae from the Inferior Oolite 
rocks of Yorkshire are either too imperfect to determine, or in 
all probability may be more correctly regarded as impressions of 
thalloid Liverworts. Lindley & Hutton' described a fossil from 
Gristhorpe under the name Fucoides arcuatus, and the same species 
is figured in the third edition of Phillips' Geology of the Yorkshire 
Coast "^ ; there is little doubt, however, that the type-specimen 
of Lindley & Hutton is an imperfect example of Leckenby's 
Fucoides erectus,^ a species now placed in the genus Marchantites. 
A still more imperfect fossil from Gristhorpe, named by Phillips 
Fucoides diffusus,'^ may also be doubtfully refen-ed to Leckenby's 
species.

iri'egularly parallel ridges; and on the other face, as shown in 
Fig. 6, two sets of ridges intersect, dividing the surface into 
a number of depressed areas, which present a slight resemblance 
to a partially decorticated Lepidodendroid stem. The ridges are 
no doubt ripple-marks produced on the surface of an argillaceous 
sand; the specimen is of some interest as illustrating a possible 
source of error, and agrees very closely with a photograph of 
intersecting ripple-marks figured by Williamson* in 1885.

shows a distinct and comparatively broad darker median band, with 
lighter- coloured and thinner margins. 

The specific name erectus proposed by Leckenby in 1864 is 
adopted in preference to the older term arcuatus, because the 
specimen to which Lindley & Hutton applied the latter name 
was much more imperfect than Leckenby's type, and it is not 
certain, although highly probable, that the two are specifically 
identical. Leckenby's type - specimen presents a striking re- 
semblance to some recent members of the Marchantieae, and, as

Nathorst also suggested, it would seem to be more fitly referred 
to the Liverworts than to the Algae. Leckenby, in defining the 
species, speaks of the occurrence of "fructification in one or more 
rows of ovate vesicles immersed in the frond," ^ but an examination 
of the type -specimen does not reveal any characters suggestive of 
organs of fructification. The best examples of this plant are those 
in the Leckenby Collection ; in tbe York Museum there are a few 
specimens of M. erectus labelled Spharococcites arcuatus. 

The present species of Marchantites bears a close resemblance 
to M. Zeilleri, Sew.,^ from the Wealden rocks of Sussex ; the 
two may be identical, but the habit of the older form appeal's 
to be more spreading and open than in the Wealden species. 
A small and imperfect fragment has been described by MM. 
FUche & Bleicher' from the Lower Oolite rocks of Nancy, 
under the name of Marchantites oolithicm, but the material on

and a thinner lateral margin, which appears as a light-brown

the midiib being 1 mm. wide. The specimen figured by Lindley

of branching, but the drawing suggests a stiflFer and less delicate

imperfect example of Marchantites erectus.

EQtJISETALES. 



Group PTERIDOPHYTA 
(VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS). 

Class EQUISETALES. , 

Perennial plants with underground branched rhizomes, from 
which are given off roots and erect branched or unbranched 
aerial shoots. The shoots are characterized by the small verticillate 
sheathing leaves borne on the slightly swollen nodal regions ; the 
nodes are separated by longer or shorter internodes. The sporangia 
occur on specially modified sporophylls or sporangiophores, aggre- 
gated to form a definite strobilus or spore-bearing cone. 

The Equisetales include the single recent genus JEquisetum and 
the fossil genera ^quisetUes, Phyllotheca, Schizoneura, Calamites, 
and Archaocalamites ; the genus Equisetites is the only one 
represented in the Yorkshire Oolite flora. 

Family EQTJISETACE^. 

An accurate diagnosis of the family Equisetaceae as including 
the recent Horsetails and species of Equisetites is practically 
impossible, as our knowledge of the fossils is far from complete. 
The striking similarity of the fossil stems from Triassic, Jui'assic, 
and more recent formations to the widely distributed Equisetums, 
justifies the inclusion of Equisetites in the Equisetaceae as a type 
agreeing in habit, and presumably in structural features, with the 
recent genus ; but our information rests solely on external 
characters, and we know little or nothing as to the anatomy of 
the fossil Horsetails, nor have we any evidence as to whether the 
sporangia contained spores of one kind only or were heterosporous. 



EftTJISETITES. 53 

Genus BQUISETITES, Sternberg. 
[Flor. Vorwelt, v.-vi. p. 43, 1833.] 

1. Equisetites columnaris, Brongn. 

2. Equisetites Beani (Bunb.). 

A generic name applied to such fossil stems as closely resemble 
the recent genus Equisetum. 

The various species of Equisetites are founded on stems, leaves, 
and strobiH, which occur as casts or impressions, and nothing is 
known with certainty as to the anatomical characteristics of the 
fossil forms. The large size of some of the Triassic and Jurassic 
stems and the fine longitudinal striation occasionally seen on the 
surface of the casts, render it probable that some at least of the 
fossil Horsetails grew in thickness by means of the activity of 
a cambium, as we know to have been the case with the Palaeozoic 
Calamitean plants. 

It is an unsatisfactory task to attempt to define the distinguishing 
characters of species of Equisetites, which are usually represented 
by fragments of rhizomes or aerial shoots. The leaf- sheaths are 
often imperfectly preserved, and aflford uncertain evidence as to 
specific features ; the differences in the diameter of the stem 
fragments and in the length of the intemodes are often such as 
might easily occur in the same plant.

on which Brongniart's diagnosis was founded were sent to him by 
the Philosophical Society of York. 

Stem reaching a diameter of 5-6 cm., with intemodes 13-14 cm. 
long. The nodal region slightly swollen, at least in the larger 
stems or branches, bearing leaf-sheaths closely adpressed to the 
stem with 70-80 linear acuminate teeth. In the smaller branches 
the leaf-sheaths consist of a smaller number of segments, and 
occasionally occur as isolated sheaths with radiating linear teeth 
apart fix)m the branches or lying on the surface of an inteniode. 
In the thicker specimens the free distal ends of the teeth have 
usually been broken off, the sheaths having a truncated margin. 
The leaf-segments are separated from one another by a fairly deep 
V-shaped groove, which widens towards the edge of the leaf- 
sheath, where the teeth become free. The median portion of each

EQXJISETITES. 55 

leaf - segment is flat or slightly depressed, and the edges in 
well-preserved specimens bear small protuberances, which may be 
indications of siliceous deposits in the epidennis. 

The stem or larger aerial branches bore occasional branches at 
the nodes, about five at each branching node ; the more slender 
specimens sometimes possess still more delicate branches (e.g. Text- 
fig. 3). 

Nodal diaphragms occur frequently on the lower part of the 
intemodes of the smaller branches, or as isolated discs ; the 
diaphragms consist of a central cu'cular area of tissue, from which 
radiate nan'ow bands separated by slightly broader spaces. 

Brongniart defined the species in 1828 as follows: — " E. caule 
erecto, simplici, laevi, cylindrico, diametro 2-3 poll, aequali, articulis 
versus basim approximatis, superae distantibus ; vaginis erectis, 
cauli arete applicatis, multidentatis, dentibus brevibus, sed in 
acumine filiformi caduco productis." * 

In the work of Young & Bird (1822)* a figure is given of a fairly 
large JEquhetitea branch, and additional drawings of the same 
species occur in the second edition^ published in 1828. These 
authors refer to Equisetites as a reed-like plant abundant in the 
strata exposed in the cliffs opposite High Whitby ; they compai'e 
the fossils with Equisetum, and regard the vertical position of the 
casts as a proof of their occurrence in situ ; they suggest, however, 
that both stems and matrix may have been transported into their 
present position. It is interesting to notice that Young & Bird 
speak of the occurrence of lateral branches, a fact overlooked by 
later writers. The occurrence of branch -scars protruding through 
the lower portion of the leaf-sheaths of several specimens fully 
bears out the conclusion of these authors (vide PI. XIX. Fig. 1). 

The casts of Equisetites columnar is have long been familiar 
fossils in the Lower Estuarine beds in the clifEs near Whitby 
and elsewhere ; they often occur in a vertical position in the 
sandstone,* or as flattened carbonaceous impressions on the associated 
bands of shale. Many writers have expressed the opinion that 
these Equisetaceous plants contributed largely to the formation

of the thin coal-seams of the Estuarine series ; the occurrence of 
an argillaceous bed crowded with small roots immediately below 
the coal has suggested a comparison with the underclays of the 
Coal-measures. 

Konig's species Oncylogonatum carhonarium,^ from the Brora 
Coalfield of Sutherland, is no doubt identical with Eq^uisetites 
columnaris of the Yorkshii'e rocks; the coal-seams of the Brora 
district are considered by Konig to have been formed, in part 
at least, from the remains of the reed-like plants to which he 
applied the above name.' 

In 1829 Phillips' published a figure of a slender fossil stem 
from Saltwick under the name Equisetum laterale, characterized 
by the occurrence of small circular areas of a wheel-like pattern 
on the internodal region. The same form of stem was also figured 
and described by Lindley & Hutton ^ in 1836 ; by these authors 
the circular discs are compared with the phragma of a Calamite. 
They remark that similar discs were said to occur as isolated 
objects on the surface of the shale (on the authority of 
" Mr. Williamson, jun." — the late Professor Williamson). In 
1851 Bunbury® discussed another example of Phillips' species, in 
which narrow spreading leaves were given off from the node as in 
Aster ophyllites. The fossil represented in Text-fig. 3 (No. 40,561) 
is probably the one which Bunbury had before him, and it is 
certainly the specimen figured by Zigno as Calamites lateralis. 
The long ' spreading leaves ' of these authors are no doubt slender 
branches, the time Equisetaceous leaf-sheath being faintly shown 
as a series of small pointed teeth just above the nodes. Heer, misled 
no doubt by the descriptions of Hunbury and Zigno,® proposed to 
transfer Phillips' species to the genus Phyllotheca, and Schimper '' 
substituted the generic name Schizoneura. The circular discs on

the intemodes of this form have long proved a difficulty, several 
authors having regarded them as branch -scars occurring some 
distance above the nodal region. Lindley compared them with the 
nodal septa of Catamites, and Schimper afterwards regarded them 
as displaced nodal diaphragms. This is, I believe, the correct 
explanation of the circular discs.

(Block lent by the Cambridge University Press.) 

The frequent occurrence of isolated nodal diaphragms renders it 
probable that the tissue of these organs was strengthened by the 
development of periderm, and possibly by a subsequent sclerification 
of the cells. It has been shown ^ that the parenchymatous nodal

58 EQIJISETITES. 

diaphragms of Calamites developed a layer of cork -tissue, and 
Jeffrey* has more recently described the partial sclerification of 
periderm cells in the diaphragms of recent Horsetails. 

The specimen (No. 10,379) represented in PI. XIX. Fig. 4 
affords a good example of an isolated nodal diaphragm, and in 
Fig. 5 of the same Plate a portion of a similar diaphragm is 
surrounded by an imperfectly preserved leaf-sheath ; the latter 
specimen, from the Leckenby Collection,* demonstrates the nature 
of the discs, and shows that their usual manner of occurrence 
a little distance above the node is merely the result of displace- 
ment. As the hollow branches were crushed by the weight of 
overlying sediment the diaphragms, being comparatively resistant, 
were squeezed from their original position and flattened out on 
the intemode.' 

It has been the custom to regard the form named by Phillips 
Equisetum later ale as specifically distinct from Brongniart's species ; 
but a comparison of numerous specimens of Equisetites colmnnaris 
and E. lateralis has led me to unite both under Brongniart's 
designation. Nathorst inclined to this view, as shown by a note 
written on a specimen of E. lateralis in the Leckenby Collection — 
" Eq. columnaris includes Eq. lateralis" The difference in diameter 
between the smaller examples of E. lateralis and the ordinary casts 
of E. columnaris is considerable, but in a large collection it is easy 
to find intermediate forms ; the leaf-sheaths also exhibit no dis- 
tinguishing features, but agree in the form of the segments and 
in their minute surface features. 

The Italian specimens figured by Zigno * as Equisetites Veronensis 
appear to be identical with the common British species, and his 
species has therefore been included in the above synonymy. The 
fragments of stems described by Saporta^ from rocks referred 
to a Bathonian horizon bears a close resemblance to Equisetites 
columnaris, and may well be specifically identical; but in the 
absence of more satisfactory evidence than is afforded by Saporta's

figures we may consider the French specimens as probably identical 
with, or at least closely allied to, the British species. 

Heer ^ compares his Siberian species, Phyllotheca sibirica, with 
Phillips' Equisetum laterale, but recognizes certain small differences 
which he considers of specific value. There is, however, so close 
a correspondence between Heer's figures and some examples of 
the Siberian plant in the British Museum collection and certain 
of the Yorkshire specimens, that it would seem very probable the 
two plants are not specifically distinct. 

The specimens figured by Raciborski ' from the Cracow Jurassic 
rocks as Equuetites hlandus present a close agreement with such 
examples of E. columnaris as those shown in Figs. 4 and 5, 
PL XIX., and in Text-fig. 3. 

Although no fertile shoots of E. columnaris have been recognized, 
it is reasonable to assume that they were of the same type as the 
strobili of recent Horsetails, with which the cones of some other 
Mesozoic species of Equisetites closely agi'ee. 

It is practically impossible to discriminate accurately between 
many of the Mesozoic Equisetaceous stems, or to give definite 
diagnostic characters, but it is at least probable that Equisetitea 
columnaris is specifically distinct from the more slender Wealden 
species Equisetites Lyelli, Mant.' The latter species never reached 
the same girth as the older plant, and the more robust habit of the 
Inferior Oolite and Triassic Horsetails seems to be a well-marked 
feature of some importance. 

Some of the older species of Equisetites, e.g. E. Muensteri, bear 
a fairly close resemblance to E. columnaris, and, while probably 
specifically distinct, the form,er plant must be considered, as Schenk * 
suggests, an analogous species. The specimens figured by Andrae * 
from Steierdorf and by Tenison- Woods • from Queensland are too 
imperfect to admit of satisfactory identification, but the fragments 
figured by these authors as Equisetum laterale and E. roti/erum

respectively recall the slender branches and leaf-sheaths of the 
English species. 

Numerous examples of Equisetites columnaris are met with in 
practically all collections of Inferior Oolite plants. The smaller 
forms, formerly spoken of as Equisetites lateralis, are less common, 
but good specimens may be seen in the museums of Cambridge, 
Oxford, Manchester, York, Scarborough, and elsewhere. 

The large stems of the recent species, Equisetum giganteum, L.,^ 
which grows in the marshes of tropical A.merica, may be compared 
with the still larger plant, which must have formed a prominent 
feature in the landscape of the low-lying marshj^ ground bordering 
the Jurassic sea in the north-west of Europe. 

V. 2613«. PI. XTX. Fig. 1. 

This small specimen shows two nodes with the short stumps of 
two alternating whorls of branches. The knobs or branch-scars 
occur at regular intervals on each branching node, and the members 
of each whorl are situated midway between those of the next 
whorl. 

In this cast the pointed tips of the leaf-segments have not been 
preserved, but the form of the sheaths is clearly indicated. 

40,681. PI. XIX. Fig. 3. [Also in Seward (98), p. 265, 
fig. 58b.] 

The large cast, of which the figure represents a portion of one 
node, measures 49 cm. in length, and affords a good example of 
the large type of branch with long intemodes. The organic 
substance of the stem has been replaced by a thin film of 
carbonaceous material encircling the sandstone cast ; the bulk 
of the specimen being no doubt the cast of a large hollow pith. 
The breadth of the branch is 5*5 cm., and the internodes have 
a length of 13-14 cm. The leaf-sheaths consist of 70-80 teeth, 
usually truncate at the margin of the sheath, but in the portion 
represented in Fig. 3 the acuminate distal ends of the teeth are 
faintly indicated. The leaf -sheath projected slightly fi'ora the 
surface of the branch, the intervening space being filled with

There are fragments of several imperfect specimens lying on the 
shale ; the best example, which is shown in the figiire, measures 
11-2 cm. long and 1-2 cm. in breadth, the internodes having 
a length of 4'5 cm. Portions of leaf -sheaths with short teeth 
are faintly indicated at the nodes, tind distinct impressions of 
diaphragms occur above the nodal lines. The long slender 
appendages, of a light - brown colour, which were formerly 
described as leaves, are no doubt delicate branches comparable 
to the finer branches of some of our recent Horsetails. No 
trace of nodes can be made out on the surface of the branches, 
but the preservation is far fi'om perfect. A somewhat similar 
specimen from the Yorkshire coast, with traces of branches, may 
be seen in the Leeds Museum. 

10,379. PL XIX. Fig. 4. 

An isolated nodal diaphragm, showing a central flat area and 
slightly convex radiating bands of cai'bonized tissue separated fi'om 
one another by spaces. These diaphragms are usually about 1 cm. 
in diameter, and have the fonn of a shallow saucer. Part of 
a similar diaphragm is seen in Fig. 4, lying immediately above the 
lower leaf-sheath. 

The example represented in Fig. 4 (fi'om the York Museum) 
shows the leaf-sheaths and linear acuminate segments very cleaiiy ; 
it is interesting also as being larger than many of the specimens 
of the Equisetites lateralis type, and serves to connect the wider 
^. columnaris with the naiTOw branches usually identified as 
E. lateralis. 

The diaphragm of the specimen represented in PI. XIX. Fig. 5 
is surrounded by a portion of a leaf-sheath, and affords good 
evidence in support of the nature of the isolated circular discs, 
which were considered originally to be the scars of branches.

concave median portion of each leaf-segment, the outlines of the 
epidermal cells may be readily detected, and the slightly raised 
edges bear numerous small irregular tubercles, which may be due 
to the presence of siliceous deposits in the epidermal cells. On 
some of the nodes five branch-scars are shown ; these alternate in 
position with the scars on the next node. This fonn of stem may 
be compared with the type of Calamitean cast known as Calamites

as a distinct species chiefly on the ground of the greater diameter 
of the stem than in JS. columnaris; in other respects the two 
species appear to be very similar, and it is not improbable that the 
stout casts included under the present species may be unusually 
large examples of the preceding type. 

In 1851 Bunbury proposed the name Calamites Beani for some 
sandstone casts of stems fi'om the Inferior Oolite of Yorkshire, 



EQUISETITES. 65 

which had been previously named by Bean, in unpublished notes, 
Calamites giganteus. Bunburj-'s species is referred to by Schimper 
as being possibly founded on the pith-cast of Eqiiisetites columnaris. 
In 1886 Starkie Gardner published a figure of a specimen ■which 
was identified by Williamson as an example of Calamites Beani, 
and compared by the latter author with recent arborescent 
Graminese. Text-fig. 5 is taken fi'om the block used by Gardner 
in his paper on Mcsozoic Angiosperms, in which the specimen is 
quoted as possibly a AEonocotyledonous stem. The cast shows two 
conspicuous nodal regions, but no trace of leaf -sheaths, and affords no 
definite evidence of its Equisetaceous nature. Casts like that figured 
by Gardner occur in the Whitby, York, and Scarborough Museums, 
and in some cases reach a length of over 40 cm. ; they have the 
form of cylindrical or more or less compressed stems, di\-ided by 
transverse nodal constrictions into fairly long intemodal regions, 
and occasionally the casts of the several internodes occur as separate 
pieces, fitting together by clean-cut faces. The larger specimen 
represented in Text -fig. 6 shows not only nodal regions, but 
distinct indications of leaf-shcaths which reveal the Equisetaceous 
character of the casts. Some of the pith-casts of these stems exhibit 
a fine longitudinal striation on the surface, which suggests the 
presence of a woody cylinder enclosing the wide pith ; it is probable 
that these largo stems grew in thickness by the development 
of secondary vascular tissue, but we have as yet no precise 
information as to their anatomy. In the York Museum there 
are some large circular discs 10cm. in diameter, enclosed in the 
matrix of a rock conttxining a cast of Equisetites Beani, which 
undoubtedly represent the nodal diaphragms of this species.

Class LYCOPODIALES. 

Perennial plants of terrestrial, epiphj-tic, or aquatic habit, 
usually herbaceous, but more or less shrubby in a few tropical 
«pecies. Stems for the most part long and slender, dichotomously 
or monopodially branched; in some forms the stems arc short, 
unbranched, and tuberous. The sporangia are large and exannulate, 
occurring singly either in the axil of a more or less modified leaf 
or on the lower part of the upper surface of a leaf. 

The li\'ing genera included in this class are the isosporous 
Lycopodium, Phylloglossum, Psilotum, and Tmesipteris, also the 
heterosporous Selaginella and Isoetes. Isoetes, Selaginella, and 
Lycopodium are represented by British species, but the other 
genera have a restricted tropical distribution. The extinct types 
Lepidodendron, Sigillaria, and other Palaeozoic plants belonging 
to the Lycopodinse played an important part in the vegetation of 
the Carboniferous and Permian periods ; they differed from the 
modem genera in their arborescent habit and in their power of 
secondary gro^vth in thickness. 



68 lYCOPODITES. 

Genus LYCOPODITES, Brongniai-t. 
. [Prodrome, p. 83, 1828.] 

Herbaceous or small arborescent plants, agreeing in habit with 
recent species of Lycopodium and Selaginella, with branched stems- 
bearing small leaves, either all of the same form or dimorphic, 
disposed spirally or in rows. Sporangia in the axil or on the 
upper face of a leaf, or borne on leaves forming a terminal strobilus.^ 

The generic name Lycopodites was proposed by Brongniart in 
1828 for plants with pinnate branches bearing leaves disposed 
spirally or in two opposite rows, which on falling did not leave 
a well-marked or definite leaf - scar. The only Inferior Oolite 
species {Lycopodites Williamsoni) included by Brongniart in his 
genus is now recognized as a Conifer, most of the species being of 
Palaeozoic age. While some of the specimens placed in Lycopodites 
are in all probability small twigs of Lepidodendron, there are a few 
species which must be retained in Brongniart's genus as differing 
in certain respects from Lepidodendron. 

It is usually the case that the specimens described as species of 
Lycopodites have the form of delicate twigs bearing small crowded 
leaves, but with one or two exceptions there are no indications 
of the sporophylls, nor is there any evidence as to anatomical 
characters. The meagre nature of the material makes it impossible 
to decide in some instances whether Selaginella or Lycopodium is 
the most nearly allied genus, and it is safer, therefore, to use 
Brongniart's generic name in a comprehensive sense as including 
fossils, which may belong either to the heterosporous Selaginellaceae 
or to the homosporous Lycopodiacea^.

Tifpe-specimen. British Museum, No. 39,314. 

Stem slender, branched in an apparently dichotomous manner, 
bearing leaves disposed in two rows, and fairly closely arranged, 
but not contiguous. Leaves thin, entire, broadly falcate, with an 
acute apex pointing upwards or slightly inclined towards the axis 
of the branch. Sporophylls unknown. 

Lindley & Hutton ^ speak of the plant, which they describe as 
Lycopodites falcatus, as no doubt identical with a specimen figured 
by Young & Bird,^ bearing "small round crowded leaves" ; but 
it is not improbable that the drawing given by the latter authors 
represents a piece of the conifer lirachyphylhim mamillare, Brongn. 

There is little doubt that Lycopodites falcatus should be regarded 
as a Lycopodinous plant more nearly allied to the genus Selaginella 
than to Lycopodium. At the end of the diagnosis of the species 
given by Phillips,' it is stated that he detected "marks of stipulaB " 
on one of the specimens ; these pi'obably represent imperfectly 
presci-ved leaves on the upper surface of the stem, differing in their 
smaller size from the two-ranked leaves, which are distichously 
disposed. In the type-specimen of Lindley & Hutton (39,314) 
there are in places faint suggestions of smaller leaves, but the 
presen-ation is not sufficiently good to render this point certain. 
The probability is that this species, as Schcnk* suggests, agrees 
more closely with the recent genus Selaginella than with 
Lycopodium. Solms - Laubach, in speaking of fossil Lycopods, 
goes so far as to say that "all Lycopodites with distichous 
leaves may be reckoned without hesitation among heterophyllous 
forms,"* that is, among plants of the type of Selaginella. The

LYC0P0DITE8. 



habit of the plant, as well as the arrangement and thin texture 
of the leaves, and the probable presence of two kinds of leaves, 
all point to a comparison with recent species of Selaginella. 
Nathorst,^ on the other hand, has referred to Lycopodites falcatus 
as a representative of the Lycopodiuni type of plant. 

Such examples of Lycopodiaceous plants as have been described 
from foreign Mesozoic localities do not offer any close resemblance 
to the English species. A species figured by Heer'' from the 
Jurassic rocks of Siberia as Lycopodites tenerrimus is characterized 
by nan'ower leaves, and agrees closely with Taxodium gracile,^ 
described by the same author. A few specimens figured by 
Oldham & Morris* from the Jurassic rocks of the Rajmahal Hills 
as Araucarites (?) gracilis, and afterwards placed in the genus 
Cheirolepis by Feistmantel, may be compared with Lycopodites, 
FeistmanteP calls attention to the similarity of the Indian and 
British fossils, but suggests that both should probably be placed 
in the Coniferse rather than in the genus Lycopodites. There 
can be little, if any, doubt as to the Lycopodiaceous nature of 
Lycopodites falcatus, with which the Indian species appears to be 
closely allied. 

The York Museum contains an unusually good example of 
Lycopodites falcatus. Fragments are met with also in the Scar- 
borough, Cambridge, and other collections of Inferior Oolite plants. 

39,314. Figured by Lindley & Hutton (33), pi. Ixi. 

The drawing in the Fossil Flora gives a fairly accurate idea 
both of the habit of the plant and of the foim of the leaves. 
The slender axis is repeatedly forked, and bears apparently two 
rows of alternately disposed leaves. The leaves, which are in 
the form of carbonaceous films on a sandy shale, are not preserved 
sufficiently well to enable one to describe them in detail; they 
are broadly falcate in form, about 4 mm. in length, with an 
acute apex directed upwards and slightly inwards. At the tip of

Class FILICALES. 

Stem comparatively small in proportion to the size of the leaves. 
The members of this class are usually isosporous, but in a few 
forms heterosporous ; sporangia bonie on leaves which are either 
identical with the foliage leaves or more or less modified. Roots 
developed from the stem in acropetal succession, or borne on the 
leaf-stalks. The stem may be either polystclic or monostelic. 



Sub-Class FiLiCES. 



Order LEPTOSPORANGIAT^. 

The Filices or true Ferns ai'e isosporous. The spores on 
germination produce a green independently gi'owing prothallus, 
bearing the sexual organs. Leaves relatively large, in nearly all 
cases with circinate vernation, bearing scaly ramenta or filamentous 
hairs ; the sporangia are usually in gi'oups or son, either naked or 
enclosed by an indusium, borne on leaves which may be identical 
with, or more or less distinct from, the vegetative leaves. With 
a few exceptions the sporangia possess a well-marked annulus ; 
each sporangium is formed from a single epidermal cell. Stem 
horizontal and creeping, oblique or vertical, bearing scattered 
fronds or terminating in a crown of leaves.' 



' Vide Seward (94), p. 35, for a general " latroductioa to the Filices." 



72 MATONINE^. 



A. Genera assigned to existing families. 

Family MAT0NI:NE^. 

Son borne on the under surface of ordinary fronds, composed of 
a few comparatively large sporangia, with tetrahedral spores, sessile 
on a central columnar receptacle, which in the recent genus 
Matonia spreads out into an umbrella - like indusium, with the 
recurved margin tucked in below the ring of sporangia. Sporangia 
characterized by an obliquely vertical incomplete annulus. 

The recent Malayan fern Matonia pectinata, R. Br., first described 
by Eobert Brown ^ in "Wallich's Plantce Asiaticm rariores has long 
been recognized as a species which shares certain characters with 
the Cyatheaceae and other families, but differs in some of its features 
from other members of the Filices. Moore ^ referi'ed this species 
to a special tribe, Matoninese, and in recent years Baker, Christ, 
and others have treated the genus Matonia as the type of a distinct 
family, exhibiting points of contact with both the Cyatheaceae 
and Gleicheniaceae. In 1888^ a second species, Matonia sarmentosa, 
Baker, was discovered by Mr. Charles Hose at Niah, Sarawak, in 
Borneo ; this fem agrees m the structure of the sori with the 
older species, but is strikingly unlike it in the form of the fronds. 
It is of interest to note that the anatomical structure * of Matonia 
pectinata entirely confinus the conclusions as to the isolated position 
of this species among existing ferns, which were based entirely on 
external characters. Comparisons have often been made between 
Matonia pectinata and various Mesozoic species ; these rest not 
merely on a similarity or identity of habit, but on the more 
trustworthy resemblance of the sori and sporangia. Solms-Laubach' 
cites the genera Laccopteris, Selenocarpus, Andriania, Clathropteris, 
and Dictyophjllum as leptosporangiate ferns which agree in certain

respects both with the Gleicheniaccae and Cyatheaceae ; Ificro- 
dtctt/on, Gutbiera, and Carolopteris may be added to this list as 
closely allied genera. In his memoir on the Jurassic plants from 
the neighbom'hood of Cracow, Raciboi'ski ^ includes the two fossil 
genera Laccopteris and MicrodicUjon in the family Matonineae ; the 
latter genus, instituted by Saporta in 1873,* I have been led to 
consider identical with Presl's Laccopteris. 



Genus MATONIDIUM, Schenk. 
[Palaeontographica, vol. xix. p. 219, 1871.] 

This genus, founded on specimens of steiile and fertile fronds 
from the Wealden of North Germany, is thus defined by Schenk : — 

"Folia sterilia et fertilia conformia flabellato-pinnata, segmenta 
pinnatifida. Xervi primarii cxcurrentcs, sccundaiii angulo subrecto 
cgi'edientes dichotomi, ramuli simplices. Son biseriales oblongi 
indusiati. Sporangia receptaculo in ramulo affixa. Annul us 
obliquus." 

It has been the custom to adopt Schenk' s genus for such fossil 
fronds as agi'ee in habit and in the form of the sori with the recent 
species Matonia pectinata, but it is ad^•isablc not to attach too 
great prominence to the habit of the fronds as a guide to family 
or generic affinity. The habit of Matonia sarmcntosa is entirely 
distinct from that of the other species of the genus, and it is 
probable that older species may have existed which possessed 
sori and sporangia of the Matonia tj-pe, but differed from Matonia 
pectinata in the form of their leaves. Since the publication of 
the British Museum Catalogue of Wealden ferns, in which 
Matonidium is dealt with, an interesting Cretaceous species, 
Matonidium Wiesneri, has been described by Krasser from Ceno- 
manian rocks in Moravia, a type which exhibits a striking 
resemblance to Matonia pectinata ; the Moravian plant approaches 
the recent species even more closely than the allied Wealden and 
Jurassic fern, Matonidium Goepperti. Potonie' has suggested the

MATONIDIUM. 75- 

Type. Large specimens of sterile and fertile segments. In the 
Berlin Collection. 

Fronds of similar habit to those of Matonia pectinata, R. Br., 
fan - shaped or pedate, with pinnate or pinnatifid pinnae, the 
ultimate segments linear, slightly falcate, bluntly pointed. Son 
numerous on the under side of the ultimate segments, in two rows, 
one row on each side of the prominent midrib, circular or oval in 
form, covered by an indusium attached to a short central columnar 
receptacle, which bore the sporangia arranged in a circle. Sporangia 
with an oblique annulus. 

The specimens of Matonidium Goepperti hitherto discovered do 
not afford any satisfactory evidence as to the exact number of the 
sporangia, nor do we know in detail the character of the venation. 
It would appear that the sporangia were more numerous in each 
soinis than in the recent species, and so far as is known the 
venation appears to agi'ee 'with that in Matonia pectinata. 

Reference may be ♦made to Vol. I of the Wealden Catalogue 
for remarks on the synonymy of this species. The plant named 
by Phillips Pecopteris ccespitosa, and described by him in his 
Geology of Yorkshire, is included as a synonym of Matonidium 
Goepperti in my former list, but an examination of the type- 
specimen in the York Museum has convinced me that Phillips* 
specimen must be referred to the genus Laccopteris. 



V. 3660. PI. XI. Fig. 3. 

The characteristic disposition of the long narrow pinnae is clearly 
shown, but the petiole itself has not been preser>'ed. Portions of 
nine pinnae are seen, the longest measuring 16 "5 cm. in length and 
about 1 cm. broad, tapering very gradually towaitls the distal end. 
The segments are crowded, narrow, and falcate, with a slightly 
obtuse apex. The lower surface of the pinnsD is represented 
in the drawing; in each pinnule the midrib forms a prominent 
ridge, on either side of which there are indistinct depressions 
marking the position of the sori. The whole surface of each 
segment appears to have been covered with crowded sori, as in 
the specimen shown in Text-fig. 7, A. In some of the segments 
a small umbo in the centre of the soral depression marks the 
position of the receptacle.

A fairly large specimen, a portion of -whicli is shown in Fig. 1 to 
illustrate the origin of about ten fertile pinnae from the summit 
of the petiole. The leaf is preserved with the upper face exposed, 
the sori appearing as two rows of circular elevations. In some 
places where the carbonaceous film has been removed there appear 
to be indications of the individual sporangia, but these are not 
at all clear. The small basal pinnules are well shown. Labelled 
by Bean Pecopteris muUicaulis.

This fragment shows the short rounded pinnules on the basa. 
portions of the pinnae, and illustrates the occurrence of sori on 
even the smallest segments. In Matonidium Goepperti, as in 
Matonia pectinata, all the segments of a frond appear to be fertile. 
The figure represents the sori as circular elevations, with a central 
depression, projecting from the lower surface of the pinnules.

Genus LACCOPTERIS, Presl. 
[Presl, in Sternberg, Flor. Vorwelt, fasc. vii. p. 115, 1838.] 

1. Laccopteris polypodioides (Brongn.). 

2. Laccopteris Woodwardi (Leckenby). 

This genus was instituted by Presl in 1838 for some fragments 
of fern fronds from the Keuper of StruUendorf, the type species 
being named Laccopteris elegans. The generic characters are thus 
defined : — 

" Frons pinnata, nervi primarii exciUTcntes, ncrvi secundarii 
dichotomi ramulis furcatis siraplicibusve, mediis in medio dorso 
soriferis. Sori biseriales, foveas scmiglobosoD immcrsi, e sporangis 
compositi." 

The same genus is described also by Giippert,* Schenk,* and 
other writers. Schenk's account of the species of Laccopteris is 
the fullest, and some excellent figures of the sori, sporangia, and 
spores accompany his plates of the fronds of this genus. More 
recently Zeiller* has demonstrated the very close resemblance — 
previously referred to by Schenk — between Laccopteris and the 
recent genus Matonia. The published figures of the Rhaetic species 
of Laccopteris represent the veins as dichotomizing and not 
anastomosing ; but an examination of specimens in the British 
Museum and in the Palaeontological Institute of Berlin has 
convinced me that anastomoses are fairly frequent. A specimen of

78 LACCOPTERIS. 

Laccopteris elegans (Presl) from Bayreuth, in the Britisli Museum 
Collection (N'o. 500), shows anastomosing veins in some of the 
more perfectly preserved pinnules.^ The Laccopteris venation may 
he compared with that of Matonia pectinata, but in the latter fern 
the anastomes between the lateral veins are rather less numerous 
than in Laccopteris. The close agreement between Laccopteris 
and Matonia as regards the form of the frond, the structure of 
the sori and sporangia, and the venation characters afford sufficient 
evidence for the inclusion of the genus in the Matoninese. We 
may define the genus Laccopteris as follows : — 

Fronds pedate, in habit like those of Matonia pectinata, E.. Br., 
with pinnate or pinnatifid pinnae ; ultimate segments linear in 
form, with a well-marked midrib giving off numerous secondary 
veins which branch dichotomously, and are in places connected by 
short lateral anastomoses. Sori circular, forming a single row 
on each side of the midrib ; the sporangia are usually few in 
number, from five to fourteen, with an oblique annulus and 
tetrahedral spores.

the base of each pinna. Sori borne in two rows, on the under 
surface of the segments, one row on each side of the midrib ; each 
sorus consists of as many as twelve or fourteen large sporangia 
(Text-fig. 10), with an oblique annulus and tetrahedral (?) spores. 
The sori are circular in form, probably without an indusium ; but 
this point is difficult to decide with certainty, the individual 
sporangia being attached to a central receptacle as in Matonia. 
Each segment is traversed by a well-defined midrib, from which 
numerous secondary veins are given off at a wide angle ; these form 
a series of elongated areolae parallel to the midrib, as in the recent 
genus Woodwardia, and from the areolae or meshes forked and

veins form fairly regularly radiating meshes below each sorus.

by Lindlcy & Hutton Pecopteris profinqua are probably not 
specifically distinct from P. polypodioides ; an examination of 
the type-specimen of the former ' species ' in the Scarborough

Museum convinced me that it is identical with Brongniart's 
type. iN'athorst,' who regarded Laccopteris as a more suitable 
generic designation than Phlehopteris, has expressed the view that 
Phlebopteris pohjpodioides, P. crenifolia,'^ and P. propinqua are 
specifically identical ; the same author also states that Phillips' 
species Pecopteris ligata ' is identical with Laccopteris polypodioides.

The specimen figured by Phillips (in the York Museum) as

a badly preserved fragment of a leaf of Laccopteris pohjpodioides ; *

a specimen in the Whitby Museum (No. 2379) Avhich was figured 
inaccurately both by Young & Bird and by Phillips, and by the 
latter referred to Zigno's genus Marzaria. The type -specimen of 
Mar%aria Simpsoni is in all probability a young frond of Laccopteris 
yolypodioides ; the linear pinnules of the adult leaf are represented 
by irregular rounded crenulations on the margin of the pinnae, and 
bear a resemblance to the small and partially developed ultimate 
segments on a young frond of Matonia pectinata. 

There is a striking similarity between the Inferior Oolite species 
L. polypodioides and the older species Z. affinis, L. Muensteri, and 
Z. Goepperti figured by Schenk and other authors.' The fern 
described by Etheridge from the Ipswich Coal-measures, New 
South "Wales, as Phlebopteris alethopteroides may be compared 
with Laccopteris polypodioides} It is evident that Brongniart's 
type is a member of a family which in the Mesozoic period was 
represented by numerous and closely allied forms with a wide 
geographical range. At the present day Matonia pectinata survives 
as one of two species which have persisted within narrow 
geographical limits as tropical representatives of a once vigorous 
and widely spread family of ferns. 

39.251. PL XII. Figs. 1 and \a. 

This specimen illustrates very clearly the characteristic habit of 
the frond; five pinnae are shown converging towards a common 
petiole. The form of the leaf is precisely similar to that in 
Matonia pectinata and in Matonidium Goepperti (Ett.). Each 
pinna has a broad central axis bearing fairly broad ultimate 
segments with a midiib and anastomosing secondary veins. One 
of the lower deltoid segments is slightly enlarged in Fig. la ; 
this shows the forked and anastomosing secondary veins. The 
longest pinnule measures 1*2 cm. in length.

Family OSMUNDACE^. 

Genus TODITES. 

The term Todites is employed in preference to the recent generic 
name Todea, which has been used by some authors, on the ground 
that we are here dealing with a fossil type which it is inadvisable 
to designate by the name which is applied to recent ferns. The 
sporangial characters and the form of the frond afford satisfactory 
evidence not only of Osmundaceous affinities, but lead us to regard 
the fossils as very closely allied to the recent fern, Todea harhara, 
Moore. 

The generic name Todeopsis has been employed by Renault ' for 
some sporangia from the Culm of d'Esnost which in the form of the 
annulus recall those of Todea. Considering the great difference in 
age between Benault's specimens and the Lower Oolite fern, and 
the absence of decisive evidence as to the affinity of the French 
fossils, it is probably wiser to employ a distinct name for the 
Jurassic Osmundaceous fern.

Pinnse long, 20-30 cm., of uniform breadth, linear and gradually 
tapering to an acuminate apex, alternate and crowded on the 
rachis, given off at an acute angle (cf. PL XV. Fig. 2), but in 
the lower part of a frond the habit is more open and spreading 
and the pinnse are almost at right angles to the rachis.

TODITES. 89 

Pinnules attached by a broad base, closely set on the axis of 
the pinna, but the longer feiiile segments of the lai'ger pinnae are 
farther apart and more open in their arrangement. Slightly 
falcate, the side towards the rachis is strongly convex, and the 
outer margin is straight or concave, and bulged outwards towards 
the base of each segment ; the apex of the pinnules is acute ; 
the margin is in some cases, especially in the larger segments, 
slightly lobed. In the larger pinnae the pinnules may be between 
1*5-2 cm. in length. Towards the distal tapering end of the 
pinnae the pinnules are more falcate, and assume a short deltoid 
form (as in Pecopteris dentata, L. & H.), and the acute apex is 
directed forward. The venation is of the Cladophlehis type ; each 
segment being traversed by a midiib from which spring forked 
secondary veins, and the midrib itself breaks up into dichotomously 
branched veins towards the tip of the segments. 

The fertile pinnules have usually the same form as the sterile, 
but in the larger segments the breadth is often less in proportion 
to the length than in the sterile segments, and the margin of the 
former often shows a tendency towards irregular lobing. 

The sporangia are large and circular, and of the Osmundaceous 
type ; they usually cover the whole of the under surface of the 
fertile segments, as in Todea. 

The long list of synonyms demonstrates the confusion with 
regard to the nomenclature of this common and characteristic 
Jurassic fern. The confusion is considerably increased by the fact 
that the fern to which Brongniart gave the name Pecopteris 
whitbiemt's — a species usually considered to have been very widely 
distributed during the Jurassic period — is not identical with the 
plant to which Lindley & Hutton and several other authors applied 
the same designation. Brongniart's Pecopteris whitbienais I have 
no doubt is specifically identical with his Pecopteris TFilliamsotm, 
and with the specimen described under this name by Lindley 
and Hutton. On the other hand, the Pecopteris whitbiensis of 
Lindley & Hutton and of several other writers is, I believe, 
specifically identical with Pecopteris denticulata of Brongniart; 
but this question is more fully discussed under the latter species. 
Pecopteris tenuis of Brongniart is included in the above synonymy 
as identical with Todites Williamsoni, as the form of the pinnules 
and the habit of the frond appear to agree exactly with the 
characters of that species. Nathorst has expressed similar views 



90 



with regard to the identity of these ferns, ^ and Brongniart * himself 
speaks of the "extreme affinite " of the two species. The specimena 
referred by Phillips and Lindley & Hutton to Pecopteris recentior 
differ from Brongni art's Pecopteris Williamsonis in the larger and 
longer pinnules, but an examination of several large fronds in 
various collections has convinced me of the identity of the two 
forms. Specimens of undoubted Todites WilUamsoni are often met 
with in English museums bearing the name Pecopteris recentior, 
given to them by Bean and other contemporaries of Phillips and 
Lindley & Hutton, and there is no doubt that the examples 
so designated are simply the lower parts of large fronds of 
T. WilUamsoni. Phillips' figure of what he names Pecopteris 
curtata represents the characteristic fertile pinnules of Todites. 

The type-specimens of Pecopteris dentata, L. & H., were fortu- 
nately discovered in the Williamson Collection in the Manchester 
Museum ; ^ they exhibit the characteristic pinnae and closely set 
short and broad segments of Todites WilUamsoni, agreeing exactly 
with such specimens as 39,250 (PI. XIV. Fig. 7), V. 3654, and 
others, and with the figures of Pecopteris whithiensis of Brongniart. 

In 1836 Groppert adopted his generic name Acrostichites for 
Pecopteris WilUamsonis, on account of the manner of occurrence of 
the sporangia as shown in the figure of Lindley & Hutton. Many 
authors have retained this genus, but as Schenk and Raciborski 
have demonstrated, the structure of the sporangia clearly points 
to the inclusion of the species in the Osmundaceae ; the sporangial 
characters being such as we are familiar with in Todea and 
Osmunda. 

The figures given by Zigno of a portion of a fertile bipinnate 
frond, which he names Dichopteris microphylla,'^ bear a striking 
resemblance to Todites, and it is probable that the Italian plant 
is specifically identical with the present species. There is a close 
agreement between Acrostichites Goeppertianus^ from the German 
Khaetic beds and Todites WilUamsoni, but there are certain small

differences in the form of the pinnules which render the inclusion 
of Schenk's species in the list of synonyms inadvisable ; the two 
forms, however, are closely allied. 

Amongst the numerous specimens of ferns of the Cladophlebis 
type figured by Heer from the Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of 
Siberia and other northern regions, we find several fronds, or rather 
fragments of fronds, which are probably closely allied to or even 
identical with Todites WilUamsoni. He applies the generic name 
Asplenium^ to many of the leaves without adducing satisfactoiy 
evidence of the relationship to the recent genus. The fertile frag- 
ment of Asplenium whitbiense figured by this author appears to 
agree in the distribution of the sporangia and in the shape of the 
segments with the present species, and differs from the specimens 
in which the sori bear a resemblance to those of Asplenium. While 
feeling confidence in the identity of some of Heer's so-called 
Asplenium species from Siberia with Todites WilUamsoni, it is 
practically hopeless to attempt an accurate determination of the 
species without a careful examination of the fossils themselves. 

In Fontaine's Potomac Flora, which we now know to include 
both Wealden and Jurassic species, there are several examples of 
Cladophlebis fronds which may be reasonably identified with 
Todites WilUamsoni. Fontaine's zeal for the institution of new 
species led him to adopt new names for plants which in some cases 
he admits bear a striking resemblance to known European fonns ; 
he has frequently described under distinct specific names portions 
of fronds which one would reasonably expect to find as parts of 
one large leaf. Cladophlebis virginiensis, Font., is in all probability 
identical with Todites ; it agrees very closely with the English 
specimens with the larger pinnules, but in the absence of fertile 
pinnae it is almost impossible to speak with certainty. The 
examples with smaller pinnules which he names Cladophlebis pare a 
agree exactly with the smaller forms of Todites WilUamsoni, as 
represented in PI. XXI. Fig. 6 of this Catalogue; similarly, his 
C. distans is probably identical with the same species. Fontaine 
refers to the similarity of his Cladophlebis parva and Pecopteris 
dentata of Lindley & Hutton, and adds, "one may well hesitate 
to separate them"; but he considers the venation is not quite 

' Heer (77), ii. pi. xxi. fig. 4.

identical. An examination of the type of Lindley & Hutton leads 
me to recognize the venation characters as being in the closest 
agreement. 

It is to Schenk and Eaciborski that we are indebted for the 
detailed examination of the sporangia of Todites Williamsoni : 
the former author ' published a figure of a fertile pinnule bearing 
well -preserved sporangia in his paper on the plants collected by 
Szechenyi in China, and Raciborski "^ has since confirmed Schenk's 
conclusions. There are several ferns figured by different authors 
as Asplenium whitbyense, which may be identical with Todites, 
but in many cases it is impossible to speak positively without 
seeing the specimens.' The rich flora of the Jurassic rocks of the 
Cracow district contains several excellent specimens of Todites ; 
some of these are referred to T. Williamsoni by Raciborski, 
while others, which I believe to be specifically identical, are 
placed under different names. This author uses the specific 
designation whitbiensis in l^rongniart's sense, and includes under 
that name certain fronds which cannot J)e separated from Todites 
Williamsoni. Raciborski' s figures in Engler's Jahrbuch and in his 
Jurassic Flora of Cracow should be consulted as the best so far 
published of the sporangia of Todites. 

It is, I believe, safe to assert that the recent Australian and 
South African fern Todea barbara, Moore, is the species which 
agrees most closely with one of the commonest plants in the fern 
vegetation of the Inferior Oolite period. 

The last English specimen of Todites Williamsoni that I have 
seen in which the sporangial characters are clearly shown is in the 
Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 48). The Museums of York, 
Scarborough, Manchester, and Whitby contain numerous examples 
of this common Inferior Oolite species, bearing a variety of names, 
•e.g., Pecopteris Lindleyana, Neuropteris recentior, N. undulata^ 
N. lobifolia, Pecopteris dentata, P. whitbiensis, P. curtata, etc. 
A specimen in the Museum of Lund (No. 568), labelled by 
Nathorst Acrostichites, n.sp., is probably a small example of Todites 
Williamsoni. There is a striking similarity between some of the

A. large specimen 45 cm. in length, bearing crowded linear 
pinnae springing from the broad rachis at a wide angle. The 
longest pinna measures 15*5 cm. in length; the pinnules are 
broad and short, and closely set on the long pinna axis. This 
example shows very clearly the characteristic habit of the frond, 
the long and very gradually tapered pinnoD, and the crowded, 
short, and broad pinnules, with their inner margins strongly^ 
convex and the outer edge straight or slightly concave and 
bulging outwards towards the broad base. The -senation is clearly 
shown. Cf . this specimen and the examples with larger pinnules,

An instructive specimen of a large sterile frond, 19 cm. in length, 
of the form figured by Lindley & Hutton as Pecopteris dentata. 
The rachis gives off numerous crowded pinnaB, the longest of which 
is 14 cm. long and 1*3 cm. in breadth ; as shown in the figure, the- 
ultimate segments become more falcate and sharply pointed towards 
the tips of the pinnse. The margins of the pinnules appear to be 
entire, but in some of them the margin is slightly irregular ; each 
pinnule is traversed by a midrib, from which are given off forked 
secondary veins at an acute angle.

This specimen shows portions of large pinnae almost at right 
angles to the rachis. The longest pinnules are about 1*3 cm. in 
length, and of thin texture ; there are no definite teeth, but the 
margin of some of the segments is slightly irregular or wavy. 
Towards the tip of the pinnae the segments assume a more falcate 
form, but in the basal portions they are practically straight.

This type of specimen is very difficult to determine ; it bears 
a close resemblance to some forms of Cladophlebis denticulata 
(Brongn.), but the broad bases of the pinnules and the habit of 
the fi'ond point to Todites Williatmoni as the more likely species.

angle to the broad rachis ; the fertile pinnules have a somewhat 
ragged outline, and are longer and nan-ower than the sterile 
pinnules of such a pinna as that of Fig. 5 (39,226). The specimen 
is evidently from the lower part of a fertile frond, where the

Family CYATHEACE^. 

It is not always an easy matter to draw a satisfactory 
tlistinction between fossil ferns which exhibit the characters of 
the CyatheacesD, and those which should be compared with some 
recent species of Davallia. While admitting with Nathorst that the 
genus Davallia was probably represented in the Jurassic vegetation 
by near allies, I have been led to conclude that the Cyatheacea) 
played a prominent part in the fern floras of the Mesozoic period. 



98 CONIOPTERIS. 

Genus CONIOPTERIS, Brongniart. 
[Tableau foss. veg. p. 26, 1849.] 

1. Coniopteris hymenophylloides (Brongniart). 

2. Coniopteris quinqueloba (Phillips). 

3. Coniopteris arguta (Lindley & Hutton). 

Brongniart made use of this generic name for such fossil fern 
fronds as show characters more or less intermediate between 
Pecopteris and Sphsnopteris, and agree with the recent Dicksoniese 
in the form of the sori. Saporta adopted this term and, like 
Brongniart, he quotes Tympanophora of Lindley & Hutton as the 
type of a fertile pinna of the genus Coniopteris. The following 
definition is given by Saporta of Brongniart's genus : — 

" Le genre Coniopteris ainsi constitue comprend des especes 
a pinnules steriles, plus ou moins retrecies a la base, lobees, 
denticulees sur les bords et pourvues d'une nervation pinnee ; 
les fructifications, en forme de clou, de rein ou de coin, plus ou 
moins elargies au sommet, sont disposees vers l'extremit6 des 
nervures secondaires qu'elles terminent ; le limbe contracte a disparu 
en tout ou en partie, et la pinnule, dans les portions fertiles des 
frondes, le trouve presque reduite aux seules mesures elargies 
en clou et servant de support aux sores. Ces organes disposes en 
forme de receptacle, de texture evidemment coriace, sont generale- 
ment ranges deux par deux de chaque cote de la mediane." ^ 

Solms - Laubach,^ in referring to the Jurassic fern originally 
named by Brongniart Pecopteris Murray ana, and by some other 
authors included in the recent genus Thyrsopteris, advocates the 
retention of the generic designation Coniopteris in preference to 
a term implying identity with a recent genus. There is little doubt 
that the Jurassic fern described in this Catalogue as Coniopteris 
hymenophylloides is very closely allied to some recent species of 
Dicksonia as well as to the monotypic genus Thyrsopteris \ but 
rather than make use of such terms as Dicksonites or Thyrsopteris, 
it is a safer plan to retain the genus Coniopteris and definitely 
include the species among the Cyatheacese. Schimper also applies

Type-specimens. Sphenopteris hymenophylloides, Brongn., in the 
Paris Museum. [S. arguta, L. &H., Manchester Museum.' 8. nephro- 
carpa, Bunb., Leckenby Coll., Cambridge. S. Murrayana, with 
fertile pinnae of Tympanoplwra racemosa, figured by Leckenby, in the

Frond tripinnate ; pinnae linear acuminate, attached to the rachis 
:at a wide angle ; the pinnules vary considerably in size and shape, 
in some forms they have a few broad and rounded lobes and in 
•others the lamina is deeply dissected into narrow linear segments. 
The fertile pinnules bear the sori at the ends of the veins ; the 
lamina is usually much reduced, and in extreme cases the fertile 
segments agree closely with those of Thyrsopteris elegans, Kze. , or 
Bicksonia Bertervana, Hook. The sori are partially enclosed in 
a cup-shaped indusium ; the sporangia appear to have an oblique 
-annulus of the Cyatheaceous type. The two lowest pinnules of 
a. pinna are often characterized by their unusual shape, the lower 
half of each pinnule consisting of long spreading and irregular 
Aphlehia-]i\e lobes (vide PI. XXI. Figs. 1-4).'- 

Venation and fonn of the frond of the Sphenopteris type. 

Brongniart's figure of the type-specimen of Sphenopteris hymenO' 
phylloides agrees very closely with the example represented in 
PI. XX. Fig. 1 of this Catalogue; the only difference being that 
Brongniart's specimen is a somewhat large form, Phillips' species 
S. stipata is included by the French author as a synonym of 
S. hymenophylloides. The following is the original diagnosis of 
S. hymenophylloides : — 

"S. foliis bipinnatis, tenuissimis, pinnis lineari - lanceolatis, 
Tachi alato ; pinnulis approximatis, ovatis, pinnatifidis, lobis ovatis 
tridentalis, inferiori et oxteriori (versus apicem pinnarum) majori, 
pinnatifido ; nervulis tenuissimis." 

Brongniart compares S. hymenophylloides with the filmy ferns 
Hymenophyllum and Trichonwnes, but with his usual astuteness 
he expresses the opinion that there is a more perfect analogy with 
some of the recent Dicksonias, e.g. B. ruhiginosa, B. dissecta, etc. 

Phillips' species, S. stipata, is represented in the first edition 
of the Geology of Yorkshire by a very poor figure ; in the third

edition it is transferred to S. hjmenophylloides, and compared with 
the recent species Davallia canariensis, Smith. 

In the Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast, by Young & 
Bird, some small specimens of Sphenoptoroid ferns are illustrated 
by very inadequate and crude figures, some of which certainly 
represent Brongniart's S. hymenophylloides; the original of fig. 5, 
pi. ii. of the first edition of this work is undoubtedly a fragment 
of the present species.' 

Among the numerous examples of ferns in the Museums of 
Whitby, Scarborough, Cambridge, York, and elsewhere, which 
I regard as specifically identical with Coniopteris hymenophylloides, 
there are several labelled by Bean and others Sphenopteris or 
Pecopteris Murrayana. This brings us to the question of the 
possible identity of the plant which Brongniart named Pecopteris 
Murrayana and his species 8. hymenophylloides. It is probable 
that under the former designation the French author included more 
than one species ; some of the specimens, e.g. that of fig. 3, 
pi. cxxvi.,* I am of opinion should be refeiTed to Coniopteris hymeno- 
phylloides, but some of the others may be retained under the name 
Sphenopteris Murrayana. Brongniart's fig. 3 of S. Murrayana 
agrees closely with Fig. 2, PI. XXI. and with Fig. 6, PI. XVI. of 
this Catalogue. A Bornholm fern, Pecopteris Pingelii, is considered 
identical with Sphenopteris Murrayana, and this species may 
probably be added to the synonymy under C. hymenophylloides. 

There are some other species figured in the Histoire which 
should perhaps be transferred to the latter species ; the fragments 
named by Brongniart Sphenopteris crenulata may well be identical 
with C. hymenophylloides, but on this point it is difficult to speak 
with certainty (cf. PI. XX. Fig. 1, and Brongniart's pi. Ivi. fig. 3). 
Sphenopteris denticulata, Brongn., is another species which may 
be compared with C. hymenophylloides, but so far as it is possible 
to base an opinion on the figure, it would seem more probable 
that it is identical with S. Williamsonis, Brongn. (cf. Brongniart's 
figure^ and PL XVII. Fig. 2). 

An examination of the type-specimen of Sphenopteris arguta of 
Lindley & Hutton leads me to regard that species as identical with

CONIOPTEKIS. 103 

Coniopteris hymenophylloides} The fragment drawn by Williamson 
in pi. clxviii. of the Fossil Flora'^ is precisely similar to the 
specimens represented in PL XX. Fig. 1 and in PI. XVI. Fig. 4. 

In the third edition of Phillips* Geology of Yorkshire there are 
portions of various Sphenopteroid fronds figured under several 
specific names, but in many cases the drawings are not accurate 
enough to render possible the recognition of the type-specimens. 
Some of the species of Sphenopteris instituted in Phillips* work 
are no doubt identical with C. hymenopkylloides : of these may be 
mentioned S. affinis, agreeing with PI. XX. Fig. 2 ; also S. socialis 
and 8. dissocialis. It is clear that the fertile pinna3 of the form 
originally named by Lindley & Hutton Tympanophora, and 
compared by them to an alga, are of the same type as we now 
find among Cyatheaceous ferns, the sori being partially enclosed by 
a cup-shaped indusium and consisting of several sporangia with 
an obliquely vertical annulus. It has been the custom of many 
authors to consider this Tympanophora fonn of fertile pinna closely 
allied to, or identical with, Kunze's recent species of the monotypic 
genus Thyrsopteris, now confined to Juan Fernandez. The use 
of this generic name has, however, been much too widely used by 
palaeobotanical writers. I have elsewhere drawn attention to the 
obvious misuse of this generic name by Fontaine in his Potomac 
Flora.^ Other writers have adopted, to a less degree, the same 
misleading use of this genus. It is true that some of the examples 
of fertile pinnae from the Lower Oolitic rocks are practically 
identical with those of Thyrsopteris elegans and are in all proba- 
bility very near allies of this recent species, but we find precisely 
similar fertile pinnae in other genera of recent Cyatheaceae as in 
the species Dicksonia Bertervana, Hook., represented in Text-fig. 13. 
In this species the lamina of the fertile segments is considerably 
reduced, and the indusium consists of a cup with two lips; this 
two-lipped form of the indusium is not a character easy to recognize 
in a fossil specimen, nor is it by any means very obvious in dried 
examples of recent fronds. 

There is the question of the identity of various types of 
fertile pinnae met with in association with sterile pinnules of

C. hymenophylloides. Lindley & Hutton instituted two species, 
Tympanophora simplex and T. racemosa ; Bunbury described another 
species in which the lamina of the fertile pinnules is less reduced, 
as in Sphenopteris nepJirocarpa, and compared this type with recent 
species of Bicksonia. All these can, however, be connected by 
intermediate forms, and we have insufficient evidence to justify 
their recognition as distinct species. In the Tympanophora simplex

British Museum Herharium.) 

type the sori are larger and more prominent than in T. racemosa, 
of which a single pinnule bears several sori ; this difference is, 
however, most probably due to a form of compensation, that is 
to say, where we have one sorus on a pinnule the production of 
sporangia is greater than in cases where the sporiferous tissue 
is less concentrated and divided between four or five sori. 
Moreover, in such a specimen as that in Fig. 3, PI. XXI. we 



CONIOPTERIS. 105 

tave a transition from a pinnule of the racemosa type to others 
of the sitnplez form. The pinna shown in Fig. 4 of the same plate 
recalls S. nephrocarpa of Bunhury, and from this type we pass 
by gradual transitions, marked by an increasing reduction of the 
lamina, to the form represented in Figs. 6 and 8, PI. XVII. 
These details are more fully dealt with in the description of the 
individual specimens. 

The same type of fertile segment is found also in some of 
Heer's Siberian ferns referred by him to Thyrsopteris and 
Dicksonta ; e.g., D. clavipes, T. Maakiana, and T. Murrayana. 
Zigno's species Hymenophyllites Leclcenhyi, from the Italian Oolite, 
is another form closely resembling the fertile pinnoe of Coniopteris 
hymenophylloides. Finally, Raciborski figures some fertile leaves 
as Dichoma Seerii, which are probably identical with the English 
species ; and his species J). Zarecznyi might also be reasonably 
referred to the same specific type. 

There are seveml recent species with which Cont'opferis hymeno- 
phylloides may be compared. The fertile pinnae of Thyrsopteris 
eleyans, Kze.,* are practically identical with some examples of the 
fossil species (e.g., PI. XVII. Figs. 6 and 8 ; PI. XXI. Figs. 3 and 
3a) ; there is also a fairly close agreement between the sterile 
segments of the fossil and recent types. The fertile segments of 
Dicksonta Bertervana, Hook. (Text-fig. 13), have the same form as 
those of Thyrsopteris ; the two-lipped indusium of the former is 
a point of difference which may be casUy overlooked. It is 
interesting to note the striking difference between the sterile pinnae 
of the Dicksonia shown in Text-fig. 13 and the Sphenopteroid 
pinnae of Thyrsopteris and Coniopteris hymenophylloides. There can 
be little doubt that Thyrsopteris elegans may be regarded as an old 
type of fern which was widely distributed in Mesozoic times. 

Among other recent fcnis which bear a strong likeness to 
Coniopteris hymenophylloides we may mention Dicksonia arborescens, 
L'Her., and Balantium culcita (L'Her.) ; also some species of 
Davallia, e.g., Davallia canariensis, Sm., D. Wilfordii, Baker, etc. 
As illustrating a variation in the fonn of the fi'onds in the same 
plant, even greater than that in Coniopteris hymenophylloides,

reference may be made to a figure of Asplenium multilineatum, Hk.^ 
given by Eeinecke in a recent volume of Engler's Jahrhucher} 

An English specimen in the Lund Geological Museum, labelled 
by Nathorst Sphenopteris searbroensis, bears a very close resemblance 
to Coniopteris hymenophylloides, and may be identical with that 
species. C. hymenophylloides is represented by numerous specimens 
in all collections of Yorkshire Jurassic plants. 

52,568. PI. XYI. Figs. 4 and 5. 

Several pieces of pianse with deeply dissected pinnules, varying^ 
in size from the small and narrow form shown in Fig. 4 to the 
broader deltoid shape of Fig. 5. The venation is very clearly 
shown in some of the pinnules. These fragments appear to me 
identical with Brongniart's Sphenopteris hymenophylloides, the onlj- 
difference being that in the fragment of the lower part of the pinna 
of Fig. 5 the segments are rather broader than in Brongniart'a 
specimen. The pinna, of which a part only is drawn in Fig. 5,. 
is 8 cm. in length, the uppermost pinnules being of the form 
illustrated in Fig. 4. The type-specimen of Sphenopteris arguta, 
L. & H., agi'ees exactly with the examples represented in 
Figs. 4 and 5 ; similarly, I regard the smaller pinnae of the frond 
shown in Fig. 1, PL XX. as identical with the present specimen. 
This leads to a comparison with Heer's species Thyrsopteris 
Maahiana, from the Jurassic beds of Siberia,'^ a type which 
I believe to be identical with such English specimens as 52,568 
(PL XVI. Figs. 4 and 5), the Whitby frond shown in PL XX. 
Fig. 1, 40,467 (PL XVII. Fig. 3), and others. 

Scarborough. Bowerhanh Coll. 

V. 3672. PL XVI. Fig. 6. 

The chief difference between this pinna and those of specimen 
52,568 (PL XVI. Figs. 4 and 5) is in the more rounded form of 
the lobes of the segments, as shown in Fig. 6, PL XVI. This type 
of pinna is identical with those in some of the specimens referred 
by Brongniart to Coniopteris Murrayana, especially as drawn in 
his pi. cxxvi. fig. 3.^ The example figured in Phillips' third

edition of the Geology of tlie Yorkshire Coast as Sphenopteris ajinis 
is probably specifically identical with that shown in our Fig. 6. 

The important point to decide is the specific identity of the 
fronds with pinnules like those of Fig. 6 — with more or less 
rounded or sometimes truncate lobes — and the rather longer 
segments with acutely dentate lobes as represented in Figs. 4 and 5. 
My belief is that these two forms cannot be specifically separated ; 
both pLnnaj have the same linear foim, the pinnules agree in texture 
and in venation, and one often finds that some of the pinnules 
on such specimens as that of Fig. 6 exhibit a tendency towards 
sharply pointed denticulations on the edges of the lobes like those 
in Figs. 4 and 5. There are other reasons which lead to the 
same conclusion, but these are stated in detail in the descriptions 
of the specimens shown in Plates XX. and XXI. Cf. 52,597 
(PI. XXL Fig. 2). 

52,595. PI. XVII. Figs. 6, 7. 

These fragments illustrate the association of sterile pinnules like 
those in 52,568 (PI. XVI. Figs. 4 and 5) with fertile segments 
in which the lamina is considerably reduced and the tips of the 
narrow lobes bear prominent sori. The fertile portion of a pinna 
shown in Fig. 6 is no doubt specifically identical with Tympano' 
phara racemosa of Lindley & Hutton, and with the fertile pinna 
attributed by Leckcnby to Sphenopteris Murrayana ; the sterile 
pointed segments ai'e identical with those represented in PI. XVI. 
Figs. 4 and 5, and these, as already pointed out, I regard as 
indistinguishable from S. arguta, L. & H., and S. hymenophylloides, 
Brongn., as also from those of the specimens illustrated as 
S. Murrayana in fig. 3, pi. cxxvi. of Brongniart's Histoire. 

Bunbury's species, S. nephrocarpa, the type of which is in the 
Leckenby Collection, Cambridge, agrees with the fertile fragment 
shown in PI. XVII. Fig. 6, and does not, I believe, represent 
a distinct species. Cf. also Dicksonia clavipes, as figured by Heer,.

Portions t)f sterile pinnules of the S. hymenophylloides type are

agi'eement with those of the recent fern Dichsonia Bertervana, Hk.,

The pinna shown in Fig. 3 is drawn from a bipinnate frond with 
long acuminate pinnae, bearing obliquely placed, narrow-pointed 
segments of the same form as those of Brongniart's Sphenopteris 
hymenophylloides and 52,595 (PI. XVI, Figs. 6 and 7), but 
of smaller dimensions. This specimen appears to be specifically 
identical with Hcer's Siberian examples of Thyrsopteris Maakiana^ 
Heer, and with the "Whitby specimen shown in PI. XX. Fig, 1 ; 
it affords a good example of the smaller type of frond of the same 
habit as the larger and more abundant specimens of S. hymeno- 
phylloides. A specimen, identical with this, in the Leckenby 
■Collection is labelled by Nathorst Thyrsopteris Maakiana, Heer.

This is an important specimen as affording evidence of the specific 
identity of the fronds with shorter pinnules and more rounded or 
tmncate divisions, and those of the fonn represented in Brongniart's 
figure of S. hymenophylloides. It affords additional evidence, in 
fact, in favour of regarding such pinnse as those shown in PI, XVI, 
Fig. 6 and PL XXI. Fig. 2 as identical with the type shown in 
PI. XVI. Figs, 4 and 5 and PI. XXI, Figs, 1 and 4. The two 
fronds, portions of which are drawn in Figs, 1 and 2, PI, XX,, 
occur close to one another on the same piece of rock, and fragments 
•of pinnae with shorter and more rounded segments, and others 
with the more pointed segments, occur indiscriminately associated 
together. There is also one fertile pinna like that of Figs, 6 and 8, 



C0NI0PTEEI8. 109* 

PL XVII. The apices of the pinnae shown in Fig. 1 are identical 
with those of Fig. 2, and the less deeply cut and rather broader 
pinnules in Fig. 2 are connected with the more deeply cut 
segments of Fig. 1 by transitional forms met with here and there. 
I have no hesitation in regarding the fi'onds of Figs. 1 and 2 as 
those of one plant, or at least of one species. That shown in 
Fig. 1 is identical with Heer's Thyrsopteris Ma^kiana, but it is 
connected, by slightly larger forms, with S. hymenopkylloides, 
Brongn., and with ^S". arguta, L. & H. ; the fi'ond of Fig. 2 
agrees exactly with some of the published figures of S. Murrayana, 
S. affinis, Phill., and other 'species.' The difference between 
Figs. 1 and 2 is far less than one finds between fronds on the 
same plant of several recent ferns. 
Cf. Scleropteris tenuisecta, Sap.' 

39,261. PI. XXI. Fig. 1. 

This specimen illustrates a further point confirmatory of the 
specific identity of the fronds with sharper and longer pinnules 
with those bearing the more rounded and shorter segments. In this 
pinna the segments arc of the former type, as in S. hymenophylloides, 
Brongn. ; but at the base of the pinna the two lowest pinnules 
are curiously modified and have a fonn suggestive of an Aphlebia- 
type of lamina, the lamina being much more deeply cleft and 
the narrow linear divisions much longer and more spreading. 
Exactly similar AphlehiaAJikc segments are met with on pinna) 
bearing the shorter and more rounded pinnules.

The specimen represented in Fig. 3 is shown about twice natural 
size ; the pinna measures 2*7 cm. in length. Some of the fertile 
segments are exactly like those of PI. XVII. Figs. 6 and 8, and 
identical with Tympanophora racemosa, L. & H. ; the upper fertile 
segments, which are more reduced and have only one large cup- 
shaped sorus, subtended in some cases by a short bract-like sterile 
lobe, agree with the form referred to Tympanophora simplex. 
Another feature of interest is the same long and narrow division 
depending from the lowest pinnule as in the specimen shown in 
Figs. 1 and 2.

sporangia. Cf. Thyrsopteris Murrayana as figured by Heer.

Part of fertile pinna, drawn twice natural size. The chief 
interest of this fragment is that the pinnules are only partially 
fertile; instead of a much reduced fertile segment with little or 
no lamina, we have pinnu.les of the ordinary sterile form bearing 
one or two marginal sori. The lowest pinnules have the same 
Aphlehia-Yike appearance — more obvious than shown in the figure 
— as in Figs. 1,2, and 3. 

Fragments of pinnae of the form illustrated in both Figs. 1 ahd 2

some cases by a short sterile lobe, exactly as in the slightly 
smaller example shown in PI. XXI. Fig. 3. The best specimen 
of T. simplex is in the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge. This 
shows part of a rachis with fertile pinnae bearing pinnules with 
single cup-shaped sori ; some of the pinnules, however, bear two 
or more sori, as in PI. XXI. Fig. 3. In the typical T. simplex 
fragments the single sori are larger than the son which are borne

segment.

Frond tripinnate, of similar habit to that of the preceding 
species, but the pinnules arc of smaller size and characterized by 
the narrow linear form of the ultimate segments. The sori and 
sporangia appear to be of the Cyatheaceous type. 

Phillips gives the following definition of Sphenopteris quinqueloba : 

"Frond bipinnate; pinnae long, narrow, with a slightly flexuous 
axis ; pinnules separate, petiolate, 5-lobed, changing to 3-lobed 
towards the apex of the pinna." 

The specimens on which this diagnosis was founded were 
obtained from Haiburn "Wyke and Staintondale cliffs. Another 
species, described by Phillips as Sphenopteris arbuseula, also agrees 
closely with the specimens I have included under Coniopteris 
quinqueloba. This species is described as a tripinnate frond, 
with the pinnules "entirely pinnatifid, the lobes decomposed 
into petiolate quinquepartite leaflets, set on a flexuous axis." 
A smaller specimen is spoken of by Phillips as S. arbuseula, var. ; 
this, I believe, is probably identical with S. quinqueloba : two 
figures are given of this variety, one of which represents the 
"extremity of a pinna with only the principal veins preserved," 
exactly as in the accompanying enlarged drawing (Text-fig. 14) 
of a specimen in the Manchester Museum. 

In all probability S. arbuseula, var., and S. quinqueloba are 
specifically identical, while S. arbuseula may, perhaps, be referred 
to S. Murrayana (cf. PI. XXI. Fig. 5).

In the volume of illustrations originally drawn for Linclley & 
Hutton and published by Lebour in 1877, a specimen is represented 
in plate xxxviii, which is no doubt identical with S. quinqueloha ; 
it is described as S. quinqueloha, var. arbu8cula. Williamson, in 
writing to Lindley in 1837, describes this example as "one of the 
most elegant little ferns I have yet seen on the Yorkshire coast." 

The habit of the plant referred to S. quinqueloha is rather 
more open, and the general appearance of the deeply divided 
pinnules more delicate, than in the smaller forms of Coniopteris 
hymenophylloides ; but the two species are undoubtedly closely

the character of the sterile pinnae, while the specimen — shown 
in Text-fig. 14, drawn twice natural size — affords an example 
of frond fragments identical with that figured by Phillips as 
S. arbtMcula, var., and in which he considers the lamina has 
been destroyed. It is a question whether this skeleton form of 
a pinna represents the feitile leaf or a partially macerated frond 
in which only the veins have been left. "We know that partially 
decayed fronds may assume this appearance, but it is not 
improbable that in this ease we have the noimal type of fertile

fertile pinnae, in which the sori are not preserved, rather than 
a macerated portion of a frond of the type represented in PI. XVI.

Frond tripinnate. Pinnae linear and tapeiing, given off from 
the rachis at a wide angle ; on the lower pinnae the linear pinnules 
have a crenulated margin and reach a length of 1-2 cm. The 
smaller pinnules are entire and slightly falcate. The fertile 
pinnules differ in a marked degree from the sterile segments ; 
each fertile pinnule consists of a midrib with a narrow laminar 
border tapering towards the apex, where it bears a circular 
cup-like indusium 1 mm. in diameter, with a central receptacle 
to which the sporangia were attached. 

The drawing by the late Professor Williamson in the Fossil 
Flora of Lindley & Hutton illustrates the difference between the 
comparatively long and straight pinnules borne on the lower 
pinna3, and the small, acutely pointed, and curved pinnules in 
the upper part of the frond. The ferns named by Lindley & 
Hutton Pecopteris aeutifolia and Sphenopteris serrata, I believe 
to be specifically identical with their species Neuropteris arguta. 
There is a fairly close resemblance betwe(!n the pinnae of 
Coniopteris arguta, bearing small pinnules, and the pinnae of Klukia 
exilis, but in the former species the pinnules are more acutely 
pointed and attached more obliquely to the pinna axis. 

The name Pecopteris Lindleyana was applied by Presl in 1838 
to a plant which he regarded as identical with Neuropteris arguta 
of Lindley & Hutton ; Royle also described a fern from India 
under the name Pecopteris Lindleyana, specifically distinct from 
Presl's species.^ 

Presl's specific name is adopted by Phillips, who figures 
a specimen in which fertile and sterile pinnules are shown on the 
same pinna ; the original of Phillips' figure is in the Leckenby 
Collection, Cambridge. In the absence of the characteristic fertile 
segments, it is practically impossible in some cases to determine 
the species of ferns of the Cladophle}>is type bearing small

The form of the fertile segments, especially the cup -shaped 
indusium, leads me to include Coniopteris arguta in the Cyatheaceae. 
In Text-fig. 16 the fertile segments are clearly showTi, twice

-other members of the Cyatheaceae, and are somewhat similai* to 
those of Nephrolepis davalh'oides, Swartz.* The single fertile

indusium with the small central umbo or receptacle.

Family DIPTERIDIN^. 

This family name is employed to indicate the probable close 
relationship between the recent genus Bipteris and such fossil 
genera as Bictyophyllum and Protorhipis, and to give expression to 
the deviation of these ferns from the typical Polypodiacese.

J)ICTYOPHYLLITM. 119 

Genus DICTYOPHYLLUM, Lindley & Hutton. 
[Foss. Flor. vol. ii. pi. civ. 1834.] 

The genus Dictyophjllum was founded by Lindley & Hutton 
as a designation for a pinnatifid leaf from the Yorkshire Oolite, 
which they regarded as a doubtful Dicotyledon and named 
Bictyophyllum rugosum. Plants agreeing closely with this species 
have been placed by different authors in several genera, of 
which the distinguishing characteristics are by no means clear. 
We have, for example, the genera Clathropteris, TJiaumatopteris, 
Camptopteris, Hausmannia, and Protorhipia applied to palmate 
fern fi-onds of Mesozoic age, which agree in many respects 
with Bictyophyllum and with one another. The use of these 
different names has not only led to much confusion, but has 
also considerably exaggerated the diversity which exists among 
the ferns refen-ed to under the several genera. 

Goppert's genus Thaumatopteris has been wisely included by 
Schenk and some other wiiters in Bictyophyllum ; ' the examination 
of several specimens refeiTed to these genera in the Museums 
of Berlin and elsewhere has convinced me that there are no 
satisfactory grounds for retaining both generic names. 

The genus Clathropteris was instituted by Brongniart in 1828 ' 
for a plant which he had previously described fi'om Scania under 
the name Filicitea meniscoides ; ' the most striking characteristics 
of this fern are its pinnatifid fronds and the regular square meshes 
formed by the finer veins in the lamina. The best known species 
of this genus is Clathropteris platyphylla (Gopp.),' of Rhaetic age, 
the same type which Brongniart had described as Clathropteris 
meniscoides. The main distinction between Clathropteris and 
Bictyophyllum is the more regular and rectangular form of the 
meshes formed by the secondary and tertiary veins of the former, 
but in some fronds * portions of the lamina exhibit the less regular 
meshes characteristic of Bictophyllum. It would perhaps more

accui'ately express the affinity of the plants referred to these 
genera if they were regarded as generically identical, but it may be 
more convenient to retain the genus Clathropteris, as representing 
a fairly well defined type. 

Presl instituted the genus Camptopteris ^ for certain ferns named 
by Brongniart Phlehopteris. The figure given by Presl of his 
type-specimen, C. Muensteriana — a plant subsequently referred 
to the species Clathropteris platyphjlla — represents a small piece 
of frond with the venation characters of Brongniart' s genus 
Clathropteris. 

Another plant, named by Brongniart Phlebopteris Nilssoni, and 
included by Presl in his genus Camptopteris, should undoubtedly 
be referred to Bictyophyllum. "While there are, I believe, no 
good reasons for retaining Presl's genus as originally applied, 
it may be convenient to retain it in the modified sense in which 
Nathorst has applied it to some remarkable specimens of Rhsetic 
age from Scania.'^ A restoration published by Nathorst of 
Camptopteris spiralis, Nath., in his Geology of Sweden,^ admirably 
illustrates the habit of the genus. Ha\4ng had an opportunity 
of examining the Scanian fossils in the Stockholm Museum, I can 
bear testimony to the accuracy of Nathorst's restoration. It is 
probable that a specimen recently figured by Zeiller* as the 
base of a Clathropteris frond should be referred to the genus 
Camptopteris as used by Nathorst.® 

Dunker's genus Hausmannia was instituted in 1846* for an 
imperfect leaf from the North German Wealden. The type- 
specimen, H. dichotoma, has a palmate frond, deeply divided into 
lobed linear segments traversed by forked main veins from which 
anastomosing branchlets are given off. The type-specimen of

' Since this was written, M. Zeiller, of Paris, has published an excellent work 
on Palaeobotany {Elements de Paleohotaniquc), in which he figures an unusually 
perfect specimen of Clathroptm-is platyphylla, Gopp., from Tonquin ; this is 
by far the finest example so far described of a Mesozoic species which presents 
a striking resemblance to some forms of the recent genus Dipteris, and in habit 
agrees also with Matonia pectinata and Cheiropteris palmatopedata (Bak.). 

6 Dunker (46), p. 12, pi. v. fig. 1. 



DICirOPHYLLTJJr. 121 

Andrae's genus Protorhipis was described in 1853 * from the 
-Jurassic rocks of Steierdorf under the name Protorhipis Bueliii : 
this differs from Hausmannia dichotoma of Dunker in having 
11 broader suborbicular leaf with an irrcguharly dcntated margin. 
Some fossils figured by Bartholin from Bomholm as Hausmannia 
Forchhammeri'^ are in part apparently identical with Andrae's 
Protorhipis Buchii^ while others agree equally well with Bunker's 
"Wealden type. Zeiller has recently pointed out that Bartholin's 
specimens should be referred to Protorhipis,^ and it seems clear 
that Andi'ae's genus should include fronds of the Hausmannia 
dichotoma type. As Zeiller has demonstrated by photographs 
and several good examples of Steieixiorf specimens, the genus 
Protorhipis agrees remarkably closely with the recent genus 
Dipterts, to which it is undoubtedly very neaiiy related. It is 
-convenient to retain the name Protorhipis for certain species of 
Wealden and Jurassic ferns which agree in the form of the 
frond with Dipteris, and are somewhat smaller than the tj-pical 
Bictyophyllum fronds. While it is not difficult to distinguish 
between Bictyophyllum and Protorhipis in the case of good 
specimens, it is practically impossible to do so if we have only 
fragments of fi-onds. 

If we retain Camptopterk in Nathorst's sense, the only other 
generic names of those we have mentioned which should be 
retained are, in my opinion, Bictyophyllum, Protorhipis, and 
possibly Clathropteris. 

As Brongniart* long ago noticed, there is a striking similai*ity 
between the fronds of some species of Poly podium — referred to 
a special subgenus Brynaria — and the leaves of Bictyophyllum ; 
this resemblance, however, does not extend to the habit of the 
frond as a whole. As regards the shape of the frond, there is 
a still closer resemblance between Bipteris and Bictyophyllum, and 
-a still more striking similarity between Biptcris and Protorhipis.

Frond large, palmate pedate, deeply dissected into broadly linear

Dictyophyllum rugosum, but in other species the sporangia are 
described as ha\'ing a complete vertical or oblique annulus and 
tetrahedi'al spores.^] 

In 1828 Brongniart proposed the name Phlehopteris Phillipsiiov 
the plant figured by Lindley & Hutton in 1834 as Bictyophyllum 
rugosum ; the latter name is quoted by the French author as 
a synonym, although the plant was not described in the Fossil 
Flora until 1834. We must assume, therefore, that Brongniart 
saw the description by the English authors some years before 
Lindley & Hutton published their work. The name Bictyophyllum' 
rugosicm has been usually accepted, and, apart from the question 
of strict priority, it is adopted as the better known and more 
convenient designation. In a later work, Brongniai-t* expressed 
the opinion that the English species should probably be referred 
to Presl's genus Camptopteris. 

In 1856 Zigno instituted a new specific name, Bictyophyllum' 
Leckenhyi, for a Bictyophyllam frond from the Yorkshire coast, 
with deeply pinnatifid pinnae having long and narrow ultimate 
segments, which he regarded as distinct from B. rugosum. The 
difference between such a leaf as that shown in pi. xxiii. of Zigno's 
work and Williamson's drawing published by Lindley & Hutton^ 
consists chiefly in the longer and naiTower segments of the former, 
but the existence of transitional forms affords ample evidence 
of the specific identity of the two forms. In 1878 Nathorst' 
discussed at some length the genus Bictyophyllum, and quoted 
the species as characterized by very variable leaves and as 
illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing between species and 
varieties. 

The relationship of Bictyophyllum rugosum with recent ferns 
is of considerable interest. The genus Bictyophyllum has been. 
quoted as a leptosporangiate feni agreeing in certain characters 
with both the Gleicheniaceaj and Cyatheacea),* and in that respect 
comparable with Matonidium and Laccopteris. Some of the more 
perfect specimens of Bictyophyllum certainly suggest a comparison^

as regards the form of the frond, with Matonia pectinata, R. Br., 
but the soral characters and the form of the loaf point rather 
to a comparison with the genus Dipteris. Bipteris * is a tropical 
Indo-Malay type represented at the present day by a few species, 
which have usually been placed among the Polypodiaceae, but the 
sporangia do not appear to be typically polypodiaceous, and the 
genus is clearly an isolated type of somewhat uncertain position. 
Raciborski ^ has suggested the new family term Protopolypodiaceae 
for the reception of a fertile Dictyophyllum leaf characterized by 
naked son, consisting of a few sporangia with an oblique annulus, 
•characters which are found also in the recent species of Dipteris. 
It is proposed to discuss more fully elsewhere the systematic 
position of the recent genus, but such evidence as we at present 
possess favours the view that Bictyophyllum and Protorhipis are 
closely related to Bipteris, and constitute Mesozoic members of 
a group of ferns now barely represented, but in former times 
widely distributed. It may be c6nvenient to emphasize the 
affinity of Bictyophyllum with Bipteris, and the isolated position 
of both these genera and Protorhipis, by placing them provisionally 
in a separate family, which we may designate the Dipteridinse, 
using in a wider sense a term already employed with a more 
restricted meaning.

segment represented in the figure is given off practically at right 
-angles from the axis of the pinna, and represents a portion of 
a long and narrow segment with irregularly dentate or undulating

V. 2724. PI. XVIII. Fig. 1. 

A good specimen representing the apical portion of a pinna; 
at the apex the pinna is strongly dentate, and the pointed entire 
segments become rapidly longer towards the lower part of the 
leaf, which may be described as pinnatisect with linear tapering 
segments. The whole specimen has a length of 17-5 cm., but the 
lowest part is not shown in the figure. Prominent lateral veins 
are given off from the central axis of the pinna, and from these 
. arise smaller anastomosing veins. 

The segment shown in Fig. 3, PI. XIII. is, in all probability, 
specifically identical with the present specimen, and belongs to the 
lower part of a deeply dissected pinna, of which Fig. 1, PI. XVIII. 
represents the apical portion. Beckles Coll.

This unusually good specimen from the Whitby Collection is no

Flora of England ; he compares it with Claihropteris plattjphylla, 
Brongn., and adopts the name C. whitbiensis, which Brongniart 
suggested, but never published, for the Whitby specimen. 

A comparison of specimen V. 2724 (PI. XVIII. Fig. 1) with 
Text-fig. 17 at once brings out the close agreement between one 
of the dentate divisions of the fi'ond shown in the figure and the 
portions of a pinna represented in Fig. 1, PI. XVIII. The Whitby 
specimen is an example of a comparatively small frond clearly 
illustrating the characteristic method of branching of the main 
veins, which agrees with that in the recent genus Dipteris. The 
commoner specimens of Bictyophyllum are merely portions of pinnsB 
or the ultimate segments of pinnae. 

The spotted appearance shown in Fig. 17 is due to the presence 
of small patches of carbon ; no definite trace of sporangia can be 
detected.

in the lower part of the pinna. The margin of the shorter and 
smaller segments in the upper part of the pinna is entire, agreeing

Family SCHIZ^ACE^. 

Genus KLiUKIA, llaciborski. 

[Engler's Jahrb. vol. xiii. p. 1, 1891.] 

The genus Kluhia was instituted by llaciborski as a substitute 
for Pecopteris in the species P. exilis, Phill., on the ground that 
the sporangial characters proved the fern to be a member of the 
Schizaeaceae ; a new name was, therefore, wisely chosen to mark 
a fuller knowledge of botanical affinity than is expressed by the 
form-genus Pecopteris. 



130 KLTTKIA. 

Klukia is a genus characterized by the manner of occurrence 
and structure of the sporangia as well as by the Pecopteris or 
Cladophlelis form of the frond; the sporangia possess an apical 
annulus, and occur singly on either side of the midrib of the 
ultimate segments. 

In 1851 Bunbury^ figured a fragment of a fertile pinna of 
Pecopteris exilis, and drew attention to the agreement between 
the fossil sporangia and those of the Schizseaceae. Bunbury's 
specimen, which is now in the Cambridge Botanical Museum, has 
been refigured to show more clearly the structure of the sporangia.'' 
Other figures of this species may be found in Raciborski's paper 
already referred to, and in the Monograph of the Cracow Flora by 
the same author. 

It is of interest to note that the type of sporangium characteristic 
of the Schizseaceae is met with also among Palaeozoic ferns ; the 
well-known genus Senftenbergia of Corda* is characterized by the 
possession of sporangia with an apical annulus consisting of two 
rings of thick-walled cells, while the recent species have usually 
one ring only. In a recent publication Zeiller has shown that in 
the sporangia of Lygodium a second ring of thick-walled cells is 
occasionally represented ; a fact which connects more closely the 
Palaeozoic type and the recent species.* A similar example of 
a recent Lygodium sporangium, with an indication of a double 
annulus, was figured by Link in 1842.*

Type-specimen. ? York Museum. 

Frond tripinnate, of the Cladophlehia type ; the pinnae are 
alternate and linear, lanceolate in form ; attached to the rachis 
at a wide angle. The ultimate segments are short and linear, 
with more or less bluntly rounded apices, seldom exceeding 5 mm. 
in length ; the sporangia, which may reach a length of "5 mm., 
are borne singly on the under side of the pinnules, forming a singl? 
TOW on each side of the midrib. 

It is difficult to distinguish some of the sterile bipinnate fronds 
■of this type from the fern described by Lindley & Hutton as 
Sphenopteris serrata. Nathorst considers the two forms specifically 
identical, but I believe that the latter fern should be included 
in Neuropteris arguta of Lindley & Hutton. 

Raciborski' s figures of the specimens he refers to Klukia 
acutifolia, K. exilis, and K. Phillipsi do not afford satisfactory 
evidence of specific difference ; it is probable that the examples 
so named are all referable to Phillips' species. 

There are several good examples of Klukia exilis in the 
Leckenby Collection, Cambridge, and in the Museums of Man- 
chester, Scarborough, and other places.

Genus RTIFFOIIDIA, Seward. 

[Brit. Mus. Catalogue ; Wealden Flora, vol. i. p. 75, 1894.] 

The generic name Ruffordia was substituted for the provisional 
genus Sphenopteris, because the evidence afforded by the rich 
"Wealden material seemed to justify the inclusion of Dunker's 
species, Sphenopteris Goepperti, in the Schizseaceae ; the new name 
was suggested as indicating a less imperfect knowledge of aflS.nity 
than is implied by the generic term Sphenopteris. The genus is 

1 Phillips (29), pi. viu. fig. 16. 



RTTPFOEDIA. 133 

characterized by a distinct contrast between ban'cn and fertile 
pinnae, by the resemblance of the pinnules to those of Anemia 
■adiantifolia, Sw., and by the correspondence in habit of both the 
sterile and fertile pinnae. 

Ruffordia Qoepperti (Dunker). 

[Wealdenbildung, p. 4, pi. i. fig. 6 ; pi. ix. figs. 1-3, 1846.] 

The synonymy and diagnosis of this species have been given at 
length in the first volume of my Wealden Catalogue. Leckenby 
was the fii'st to suggest the identity of the Lower Oolite fern with 
the Wealden species which Ettingshausen named Sphenopteris 
Jugleri. Schenk included Sphenopteris Jugleri, Ett., as a synonym 
of Bunker's species S. Qoepperti, and the Wealden specimens in 
the British Museum amply confirm this view. There are no 
examples from the Yorkshire Oolite rocks in the Museum Collection 
which can be referred to the Wealden type, but in the Leckenby 
Collection (Cambridge) there arc two small specimens (Nos. 144, 
158) which are probably identical with Ruffordia Goepperti. In 
the third edition of Phillips* Geology of Yorkshire there is a figure * 
■of a portion of one of the Leckenby specimens which does not do 
justice to the original, but it serves to illustrate the resemblance 
of the Jurassic fern to the Wealden type. 

The list of Inferior Oolite fossils given by Fox-Strangways ' 
includes the Wealden species Sphenopteris Jugleri, Ett. On 
the smaller specimen in the Leckenby Collection Nathorst has 
written: "Possibly the young leaf of Sphenopteris W^illiamsonia, 
or perhaps the same as S. Jugleri^ The larger specimen 
{No. 158) bears but little resemblance to Brongniart's species 
/S. TFilliatnsonis.

The species Cladophlebis denticulata (Brongn.) is included in 
the family Poljrpodiacese on the ground that the fertile pinnules 
agree fairly closely with those of some recent polypodiaceous ferns, 
but the evidence is insufficient to admit of a positive statement 
as to systematic position. The other two species of the genus 
must still be included among the ferns which do not afford any 
trustworthy evidence as to family affinities.

Type - specimens. Brongniart's type - specimens in the Paris 
Museum. A specimen, whicli is the counterpart of the type- 
specimen of Pecopteris insignis of Lindley & Hutton, is in the 
Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 342). 

Frond bipinnate, large, with long spreading pinnae attached to 
a comparatively slender rachis. Pinnules falcate, acutely pointed, 
usually finely dentate, attached by the whole of the base; the 
longest pinnules may reach a length of 3-4 cm. Venation of 
the tj^ical Cladophlehis type ; a well-marked midrib giving off 
secondary dichotomously forked veins at an acute angle. Towards 
the apex of the frond the pinnules are shorter and broader than 
the longer and narrower segments in the lower or middle portion 
of the frond. 

Fertile fronds similar in form to the sterile ; the segments of the 
same shape, but somewhat straighter, and with an irregularly 
serrate margin, the sori are oblong in shape and parallel to the 
secondary veins. 

The specimens on which Brongniart founded his species Cladophlebis 
denticulata are fairly large examples of well-preserved fronds with 
falcate pinnules having an obviously dentate margin; they are 
of the same form as those represented in PI. XIV. Figs. 3 and 4 
of this Catalogue. Brongniart regards Pecopteris ligata of Phillips 
and Neuropteris ligata, as figured by Lindley & Hutton, as identical 
with his P. denticulata. The type-specimens of P. denticulata were 
sent to Paris by Williamson and Bean from the neighbourhood of 
Scarborough (no doubt Gristhoi-pe Bay). 

The frond represented in the Fossil Flora of Lindley & Hutton 

as Neuropteris ligata has falcate dentate pinnules like those in 

Brongniart's specimen, and as shown in PI. XIV. Fig. 3. Nathorst, 

who has examined the type - specimen of Pecopteris ligata of 



CLADOPHLEBIS. 137 

Phillips in the Oxford Museum, helieves it to be a fragment of 
Laccopteris polypodioides ' (Brongn.), but he regards Neuropteris 
ligata, L. & H., as identical with Cladophlehis dentictdata} The 
same author considers that Pecopteris insignis of Lindley «S: Hutton 
is probably the lower part of a frond of P. denticulata, Brongn. 
This view is no doubt correct. The drawing in the Fossil Flora 
(pi. cv.) represents the long falcate pinnules as entire, but a close 
inspection of the type-specimen (or rather the counterpart, now 
in the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge, No. 342) reveals the 
presence of fine teeth on the more perfectly preserved segments. 
Nathorst has also suggested that the fragments figured by Lindley 
and Hutton and others as Pecopteris or Phlehopteris undans may 
belong to a fertile frond of Cladophlebis denticulata. A careful 
comparison of several specimens of P. undans with C. denticulata 
has led me to this conclusion (vide PI. XX. Figs. 3a and 3d). 
The type-specimen of P. undans of Lindley & Hutton (Scarborough 
Museum) is associated with portions of Cladophlebis denticulata on 
the same piece of shale. 

Schimper and some other authors have also considered Neuropteris 
ligata of Lindley & Hutton and Cladophlebis denticulata (Brongn.) 
identical. 

It has already been pointed out, in the description of Todites 
Williamsoni, that the specimens described by Brongniart as 
Pecopteris whitbiensis appear to be identical with the former 
species and specifically distinct from the type - specimen of 
P. whitbiensis as figuix'd by Lindley & Hutton. It woiild bo 
a hopeless task to attempt an accurate determination of the 
numerous fronds or fragments of pinna) referred by various authors 
to Pecopteris whitbiensis, Asplenium whitbiense, etc., but it is at 
least highly probable that not a few of the fossils thus described 
are specifically identical with Cladophlebis denticulata, Brongn. 
Pern fronds of the type described under such names as Cladophlebis 
whitbiensis, C. Albertsii, Asplenium Roesserti, A. nebbense, etc., 
have a worldwide distribution in Mesozoic rocks,' and we know 
that leaves of a precisely similar habit are met with in different

138 CLADOPHLEBIS. 

genera and families of recent ferns; an identification of fossil 
fi-agments of this type without the evidence of fertile pinnae is 
a hopeless task. All that we can do, is to point out what appear 
to be the most probable cases of identity among the numerous 
examples of fronds of this type in the English Jurassic strata 
and in beds of approximately the same age in other countries. 

Zigno includes Pecopteris whitbiensis, L. & H., as a synonym 
of P. ligata, Phill. The pinnules as represented in pi. cxxxiv. 
of the Fossil Flora {P. whitbiensis) have entire margins, but are 
otherwise identical with those of JVeuropteris ligata of Lindley & 
Hutton. The small portion of a pinna figured in PI. XV. Fig. 5 
of this volume is taken from a fairly large specimen of a frond 
which is labelled by Bean Pecopteris whitbiensis (No. 39,240), and 
agrees exactly with the frond illustrated under this name by the 
authors of the Fossil Flora. I believe that P. denticulata of 
Brongniart and P. whitbiensis of Lindley & Hutton are specifically 
identical. 

The specimens figured by Lindley & Hutton as Pecopteris dentata 
have been incorporated under the species Todites Williamsoni, as 
a result of the examination of the type-specimens. 

Brongniai't's figure of Pecopteris PhilUpsii^ di-awn from a specimen 
contributed by "Williamson from Cayton, near Scarborough, presents 
a f aii'ly close agreement with some forms of Cladophlebis denticulata,. 
and is clearly identical with the example represented in PI. XX. 
Fig. 4 ; this specimen has been labelled by Bean Pecopteris 
Phillipsii, Brongn. The somewhat narrower form of the pinnules 
and other slight differences between this form of frond and the 
more typical C. denticulata are, I believe, of no importance ; they 
rather suggest that the frond had been exposed to the sun some 
time and slightly contracted or shrivelled before it was embedded 
in the mud. 

Enough has been said to indicate the confused state of the 
synonymy of these Cladophlebis fronds. 

Brongniart' s specific name denticulata is adopted as having 
been published earlier than C. insignis of Lindley & Hutton, and 
as denoting a type of frond of common occurrence in collections 
of Yorkshire Oolite plants. To use the specific name whitbiensis 
would lead to considerable confusion, as different authors have 
applied this designation to fern fronds belonging to distinct genera 
and different families. 



CLIDOPHLEBIS. 189^ 

Before refcmng to othei' authors whose detenninations ai'& 
mentioned in the above synonj'my, it maj' be a convenience to 
concisely summarize the conclusions to "which an examination of 
the East Yorkshire Cladophlebis fronds has led me. 

In the first place it seems almost certain that Pecopteris undans 
as figured by Lindley & Hutton and others is, as Nathoi-st suggested, 
the fertile frond of Cladophlehis denticulata. Further reference i» 
made to this point elsewhere. The comparison of such specimen* 
as that figured by Lindley & Hutton as Pecopteris imignis, tho 
example represented in PL XIV. Fig. 1 (39,236), and many otheif, 
with specimens like that shown in PI. XIV. Fig. 3, and as figui*cd 
by authors under such names as Neuropteris or Pecopteris ligata, 
P. tahitbiensis, etc., in which the pinnules arc smaller, has con- 
vinced me of the identity of the fronds possessing larger and smaller 
ultimate segments. The prominence or almost complete absence of 
denticulations on the margin of the pinnules arc character of slight 
importance. In some cases, as an examination of tj'pe-specimens 
has shown, segments with a finely dentate border have been 
erroneously represented in drawings as pinnules with an entire 
margin. In one or two specimens in the National Collection and 
other museums the pinnules appear to be entire, but in other 
respects the fi'onds cannot be separated from those with dentate 
pinnules. To lay stress on such a point as this would be to 
magnify a chai-acter of verj' small importance to the rank of 
a specific tliffercnce ; my impression is that on a large frond 
of the fern Cladophlehis denticulata, we might well find somo 
pinnules with entire and others with a denticulate border. 
Brongniart's species Pecopteris Phillipsii, as already suggested, is. 
probably a somewhat imperfect example of C. denticulata. 

There are certain species of fronds of the Cladophlehis tj'pe 
figured by several authors from Jurassic horizons which present 
a close agreement with C. denticulata, but which cannot with 
safety be included in a list of synonyms. In Schenk's atlmirablo 
work on the flora of the strata between the Keuper and the Lias 
of Fi-anconia a frond is figured as Asplenites Roesserti (Presl) ; the 
drawing of this species in Schenk's pi. x. fig. 1 * agrees veiy 
closely with specimen No. 39,238 in the British Museum Collection, 
and still more closely with a specimen in the Leckenby Collection 

' Schenk (67). 



140 CLADOPHLEBIS. 

from the Yorkshire Oolites. In Schenk's figure we have the apical 
portion of a frond, which is characterized by the open habit of the 
pinnae and by the rather short and broad form of the pointed 
pinnules ; at the tip of the frond the pinnae are gradually replaced 
"by single falcate segments. The striking similarity leads me to 
regard the Gei-man and English plants, although from different 
geological horizons, as nearly allied, if not indeed identical. 
Another specimen illustrated in Schenk's monograph, and named 
Asplenites ottonis,'^ agrees in habit with A. Roesserti, but differs in 
the appearance of the pinnules, which are fertile, and present 
a corrugated surface due to the presence of sori parallel to the 
secondarj- veins ; these are precisely the characters of the fertile 
pinnae of C. denticulata {Pecopteru imdans). It may be suggested 
that Asplenites ottonis is the fertile form of the frond referred by 
Schenk to A. Roesserti; the very small fragment of the latter 
species described by the same author as fertile is veiy imperfect 
and far from clear. While speaking of the fertile pinnules, 
a comparison may be made also with some fragments figured by 
Heer from Siberia, and referred by him to Asplenium whithiense ; 
these possess long sori apparently with indusia disposed obliquely 
to the midrib and parallel to the secondary veins, as in Pecopteris 
undans. It is unfortunately impossible to make out the exact form 
-of the sori in the English specimens or to decide on the presence or 
■absence of an indusium, but so far as it is possible to judge, it 
would appear that the sori may have been of a type similar to that 
shown in Heer's figures, and to such as we find in some recent 
Polypodiaceous species. 

In addition to the species Pteris frigida and P. longipennis 
figured by Heer from Greenland, and included in the above list 
as most probably specifically identical with Cladophlehis denticulata, 
there are some other fragments of fronds refen-ed by the same 
author to Pecopteris argutula, Aspidium Oerstedi, and other species, 
which may be identical Avith C. denticulata; but it is impossible 
to decide as to the affinities of many of these fronds. It is not 
improbable that the Australian fern named by McCoy ^ Pecopteris 
australis, and compared by him with the English type, which 
Bean named P. scarhurgensis, is identical with that species.

In Fontaine's Potomac Flora there are several specimens named 
Cladophlehis falcata ; ^ these have the same form of frond as 
C. denticulata, hut there is haixllj- enough evidence, without 
having access to the specimens, to warrant the inclusion of 
the Potomac species among the synonj-ms of Brongniart's plant. 
Fontaine also figures some fi-onds which he names C. denticulatay 
hut speaks of this species as new, while drawing attention to 
published figures of Pecopteris denficnlata by Heer.' 

A specimen in the British Museum Collection (V. 640) from 
Steierdorf im Banat, nametl Pecopteris whithiensis, bears a very 
close resemblance to Cladophlehis denticulata, but the pinnules 
appear to have an entire margin. There are various other fossil 
fronds which may be compared with Cladophlehis dentiadata, e.g. 
Asplenium disfans as figmed by Yokoyama * from Japan ; but 
without more ti*ustworthy e^-idence than a similarity in the form 
of the sterile pinnae there must always be an element of uncertainty 
in our comparisons.* 

The point of most inteivst as reganls the comparison of 
Cladophlehis deiiticulata with recent feras is the e^adence afforded 
by the nature of the fertile pinnules of the fossil species. Wo 
know nothing as to the structure of the sporangia, and our 
compaiisons must rest solely on the form of the feiiile segments 
and the disposition of the sori. It is among the Polypodiaceaj that 
we find the nearest resemblance to the fossil species ; in some species 
of Asplenium, e.g. A. luguhre,^ also Phegopteria decussata (L.),' the 
fertile pinnules with their tliin linear sori parallel to the lateral 
veins agi'ee closely with those of Cladophlehis denticulata (^•ido 
PI. XX. Fig. Sh). Raciborski has suggested the probability of 
Cladophlehis dentiadata ' and some other species of the genus being

the sterile fronds of Osmunclaceous ferns ; the form of the fertile 
pinnse does not favour this view, and it is more in accordance 
with the available evidence to refer Brongniart's species to the 
Polypodiaeeffi. Cladoplilehis denticulata is represented in several 
museums hy many large and well-preserved specimens ; some of the 
finest are to he found in the collections at Whitby and Scarborough, 
not infrequently labelled by Bean Pecopteru scarburgensis.

A part of the specimen is shown in the figure. The rachis 
measm-es 7-5 cm. in length and 4 mm. in breadth ; the longest 
pinna is 12-5 cm. long, bearing falcated dentate segments agreeing 
exactly with those of the specimens figured by Brongniart as the 
type of the species. The pinnules are about 1-3 cm. in length. 
A precisely similar form is figured by Lindley & Hutton as 
Neuropteris ligata.

Two pinnules, represented about twice natural size, showing the

agrees with 13,495 (PL XIV. Fig. 3), but on the lower pinnse the 
ultimate segments are longer, reaching a length of 2-2 cm. ; they 
serve to connect the fronds with pinnules of intennediate length 
with such examples as that shown in Fig. 1 (39,236), in which the 
ultimate segments are longer. Towards the apex of the pinnse 
Ihe pinnules assume a shorter and more strongly falcate form.

The frond has a stout rachis fi'om which the pinnse are given off 
at an acute angle, bearing falcate pinnules reaching a length of 
2-8-3 cm. This type of frond is identical with that figured by 
Lindley & Hutton as Pecopteris insignis ; the margin of the segments 
is finely dentate, as in the type-specimen of P. insignis.

I have included this species as a synonym of Cladoplilehis 
denticulata. The preservation is far from perfect, but here and 
there fine denticulations may be detected. The pinnules are 
rather less falcate and narrower than in most of the specimens, 
but I feel no doubt as to their specific identit)', and am disposed 
to attribute the slight peculiaiities in the appearance of this fi'ond 
to the probability of its having been dried in the sun and more or 
less shrivelled before fossilization. Cf. the fertile pinnae figured 
by Lindley & Hutton as Fhlebopteris undans.

Fig, 3h represents part of a pinna of the form known as 
JPhlebopteria or Pecopteris undans. These fertile pinnules have 
the same general form as the sterile segments, but are straighter 
and the margin is distinctly serrate ; the surface of the lamina is 
raised in the fonn of oblique ridges or corrugations, parallel to the 
secondary veins, which are no doubt caused by the occurrence of 
oblong sori on the lower face. It is unfortunately impossible to 
obtain any more precise information as to the structure of the 
sori and sporangia. Cf. Schenk's figures ' of Asplenites ottonis 
and Heer's- figures of Asplenhtm tchitbienae ; also Feistmantel's ' 
.figures of Asplenites tnacrocarpus. 

The sterile fragment (Fig. 3a) shows the usual type of falcate 
and finely denticulate segments ; I have no doubt that both these 
fragments (3a and 3b) belong to. the same plant.

39,245. This specimen, an imperfectly preserved portion of 
a fertile frond, is of interest from the point of view of the 
comparison of sterile and fertile pinnae. The pinnae and pinnules 
are exactly like those represented in PL XX. Fig. 3a, but in 
39,245 we have a portion of the rachis as well as pieces of three 
or four pinnae attached to it. Labelled by Bean Fhlehopteris

fertile pinnae had the same habit as the sterile fronds.

towards the apical portion, where the pinnae are farther apart and 
the pinnules shorter and relatively broader. In the Leckenby 
Collection there is a still finer example, illustrating the open habit 
at the apex of a frond ; we have precisely the same appearance 
presented by a specimen of Asplenites Roesscrti figured by Schenk.^ 
The pinnules are slightly dentate. Labelled by Bean Pecopteris

identical with a similar apex of a frond figured by Heer from the 
Jurassic rocks of Siberia as Asplenium petruscMnense,^ and may be 
compared also with Asplenium whithiense tenue ^ of the same 
author.

The slender rachis gives off opposite and sub-opposite pinnae 
with short, broad, and apparently entire segments. It is not 
improbable that this example may be regarded as the apex of 
C. denticulata. The veins are exceedingly well shown. Cf. 
specimen 39,240 (PI. XV. Fig. 5). 

It is just possible that this specimen and 39,240 (PI. XV. 
Fig. 5), both of which have pinnules with entire margins, belong 
to a separate species of the type represented by P. wkitbietms, as 
figured by Lindley & Hutton ; but we have not, I think, sufficient 
evidence to justifj' a specific separation of these two specimens 
from Cladophlehia denticulata.

Frond bipinnate. Pinnse long, linear acuminate, and spreading, 
given off from the rachis approximately at right angles. Pinnules 
linear, attached by a portion of the base, apices more or less acute, 
the margin usually slightly lobed ; the basal pinnule on the lower 
side of each pinna is characterized by its greater breadth. [None 
of the specimens in the Museum Collection afford any evidence as 
to the character of the son, but a small piece of a pinna in the 
Stockholm Museum (Text-fig. 23) bears indications of marginal 
sori ; the data, however, are insufficient to enable us to determine 
the probable position of the species.] 

Some large and well-preserved examples of Cladophlebis lobifolia 
have been figured by Raciborski ^ from the Jurassic rocks of 
Cracow. Among the specimens in the British Museum referred 
to this species there is a great difference in the size of the 
pinnules, but this is, I believe, largely due to the unusual length 
of the pinnse, which are characterized by a gradual decrease in the 
length of the ultimate segments towards the distal end. Some of 
the larger pinnae bear a resemblance to Todites WilUamsoni, and 
a separation of the two types is not always easy ; Cladophlebis 
lobifolia is usually recognizable by the nan-ow bases of the pinnules, 
and by the spreading and open habit of the frond.

Type-specimen. Newcastle-upon-Tyne Museum.* Tlie available 
material is insufficient to enable us to give a satisfactory diagnosis 
of the species. The frond was probably bipinnate ; the large, 
broadly linear pinnules have the Cladophlelis type of venation ; 
they ai-e attached at almost a right angle, and differ from those 
of C. dentieulata in being straighter and not falcate. There are 
no specimens in the British Museum Collection which can be 
reasonably refen'ed to this species. A solitary example in the 
Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 80), agrees exactly with 
the specimen figured by Lindley & Hutton. It is possible that 
Cladophlelis haiburnensis is not a distinct species, but the general 
appearance of the Leckenby specimen hardly favours its inclusion 
in any of the other species of Cladophlebis or in Todites Williamsoni. 
There is a striking similarity between C. haiburnensis and a specimen 
named by Heer Asplenium whitbiense tenue?

and present a characteristic and somewhat stiff appearance ; the

venation miglit be described almost equally well as agreeing with 
the Sphenopteris or Cladophlehis type ; in the larger pinnules there 
is a definite midrib giving off forked secondary veins at an acute 
angle, but in the smaller deltoid segments the venation is more 
spreading and approximates more closely to that of Sphenopteris. 
The fertile segments bear sporangia covering the lower surface. 
The rectangular disposition of the pinnae and pinnules and the 
rather indefinite ragged appearance of the delicate and finely 
crenulate segments give to this species a characteristic habit. 

The description of the stem and of the fertile segments is taken 
from Schenk's diagnosis ^ of Acrostichites princeps ; neither stems 
nor fertile segments have so far been recognized in association 
with the English specimens. 

In his valuable notes on the English Jurassic plants, Nathorsf^ 
has expressed the opinion that the specimens for which Leckenby 
instituted the new specific name Sphenopteris modesta are identical 
with Presl's Rhsetic species iS. princeps, afterwards referred by 
Schenk to the genus Acrostichites and fully described and 
illustrated in the Flora of the Rhcetic Beds of Franconia. The 
figures given by Schenk represent a tj^Q of frond which appears 
to be identical with Leckenby' s Sphenopteris modesta. I cannot 
detect any discrepancies which justify a specific separation of the 
two sets of specimens ; in spite of the fact that one plant is from 
Rhaetic and the other from Lower Oolitic rocks, Nathorst's 
determination has therefore been adopted. 

Nathorst points out that the generic name Acrostichites, chosen 
by Schenk on the strength of the fertile pinnule having the 
under surface covered with sporangia, is not very suitable, as 
the same manner of occurrence of sporangia is met with also in 
species of Aspidium and other recent genera. "We may add that 
the same mode of occurrence of crowded sporangia occurs also in 
Todea, as illustrated by the Jurassic species formerly referred to 
Acrostichites and now placed in the genus Todites. Raciborski^ 
records Sphenopteris princeps from Cracow, and places it in the 
Osmundaceae under the name Todea princeps.

SPHEN0PTERI8. 163 

Some of the species mentioned in the above synonymy have 
teen included on the evidence furnished by Schenk as the result 
•of his examination of the actual specimens. 

As there is no indication of sporangia on any of the specimens 
-of this species in the English collections, I have adopted what may 
appear to be a somewhat retrograde course in placing Sphenopteris 
princeps among ferns which cannot safely be assigned to a definite 
family. The evidence published by Continental authors does not 
seem to be sufficiently con\-incing to warrant the inclusion of the 
Yorkshire plant in the family Osmundaceaj.

Tery closely with Leckenby's type-specimen of Sphenopteris modesta, 
now in the Leckenby Collection. Compare also Schcnk's ' pi. viii. 
fig. 1 with PI. XVI. Fig. 2 of this Catalogue; the two figures 
present a very close resemblance, and one can hardly doubt that 
they represent leaves specifically identical. 

The pinnffi are at right angles to the rachis, and the crowded 
pinnules at right angles to the axis of each pinna. There are some 
fragments with smaller pinnules on the same piece of shale, which 
agree with the smaller pinna figured by Schenk.

Type-specimen. Brongniart' s types in the Paris Museum (?). 
Type of Lindley & Hutton in the Scarborough Museum. 

Frond ? tripinnate ; the rachis slender and winged, bearing short 
acuminate pinnse attached at an acute angle ; the pinnules are 
deeply dissected into narrow linear and forked ultimate segments. 

There is not sufficient reason for following the example of some 
authors and using the generic name Hymenophyllites for this species ; 
we know nothing as to the character of the sori or sporangia. 

39,281. PI. XVII. Fig. 2. 

The drawing represents a portion of a pinna 7 cm. long, bearing 
deeply dissected pinnules with naiTow ultimate segments. The 
finer segments are traversed by a single vein, and the general 
appearance of the specimen suggests a fern with a thin or almost 
filmy texture ; this thin brown filmy appearance is misleading and 
need not necessarily point to an originally thin lamina. There i&

Frond tripinnate ; pinna? broad and spreading, given off from

deltoid in form, and similar to those of Coniopteris hymenophylloidrs 
(Brongn.). 

It has been pointed out in discussing Coniopteris hymenophylloides, 
that in all probability some of the specimens included by Brongniart 
and others under the name Pecopteris or Sphenopteris Murrayana 
may belong to a distinct species, which we have refeiTcd to-

156 §PHENOPTEKIS. 

C. hymenophylloides ; but other specimens exhibit certain differences 
which seem to point to the retention of Sphenopteris Murrayana 
for certain fern fi-oncis agreeing with the examples figured by 
Brongniart in figs 1, 2, and 4 of his pi. cxxvi.^ Possibly this 
separation may prove to be artificial, but it is at least a convenience 
to distinguish some of the Yorkshire ferns, which differ in a few 
points from the typical Coniopteria hymenophylloides, by a distinct 
specific designation. It is hopeless to attempt a complete synonymy 
of Sphenopteris Murrayana as employed in the present sense, as 
the greater number of the fossils so named by various authors 
should be referred rather to C. hymenophylloides. As no specimen 
exhibiting the vegetative characters which we associate with 
8. Murrayana in its restricted sense has been seen with fertile 
pinnules, the genus Sphenopteris is retained in preference to 
Pecopteris or Coniopteris. 

The fronds of the S. Murrayana type appear to be characterized 
by a spreading habit, and by the broad pinnae being almost at right 
angles to the rachis. 

39,273. PI. XXI. Fig. 5. 

The fragment illustrated consists of a secondary rachis bearing 
short pinnse with small pinnules having the Sphenopteris type 
of venation, and agreeing fairly closely in form with those of 
Coniopteris hymenophylloides. It is, however, quite possible that 
such specimens as this may belong to the lower portions of large 
Coniopteris fronds. Labelled by Bean Sphenopteris arguta.

Type-specimen. ? Natural History Museum, Paris. 

Frond simple, linear-lanceolate, reaching a length of more than 
20 cm. and a breadth of 3 cm. The lamina increases gradually in 
breadth from the petiole and tapers gradually towards the apex. 
Numerous secondary veins are given off at right angles from 
a broad midrib ; these are simple or forked ; the branching of the 
lateral veins may take place close to the midrib, in the marginal 
or in the intermediate portion of the lamina. 

There is a close agreement between the English specimens of 
Tceniopteris vittata and the species T. tenuinervis, Brauns, as 
'figured by Schenk ^ and other authors, but in dealing with leaves 
of the Taniopteris type it is practically hopeless to attempt to 
•distinguish between closely allied and identical forms. 

Unless its sori or sporangia are preserved, it is impossible to 
determine the family of ferns to which Taniopteris leaves should 
be referred ; this simple type of leaf is met with in several recent 
genera, and is of little or no value as an indication of affinity. 
T(Bniopteris vittata is one of the commonest fossils from the 
Yorkshire coast rocks. 

39,217. PL XVI. Pig. 1. 

The lower part only of the specimen is shown in the figure. 
The lamina is 20 cm. long, and the slightly curved petiole 2*5 cm. ; 
the latter appears to terminate in a fairly clean-cut face, which 
is probably the actual base by which the leaf was attached to 
a rhizome. This feature suggests a comparison with the leaves 
of the recent fern Oleandra neriiformis, Cav., which become cut 
off near the base of the petiole by a well-marked absciss-layer. 
The lamina in its broadest part measures 3 cm. ; the lateral veins 
are seen to fork at varying distances fi'om their point of origin 
from the broad midrib.

Frond simple, similar in venation to T. vittata, but of greatei* 
breadth in proportion to its length than the previous species. 
The midrib in T. major is narrower and less prominent than in 
T. vittata. Veins approximately at right angles to the midrib, 
rather farther apart than in T. vittata, forked either close to the- 
midrib or at varying distances from their point of origin. 

The specimen figured by Lindley & Hutton from a drawing 
by "Williamson, and now in the Manchester Museum, illustrate* 
the chai'acteristic form of this broader-leaved Teeniopteris very 
clearly ; the dichotomously branched veins are clearly shown. 
Some authors have called attention to the venation of this species 
as a distinguishing feature ; in T. vittata the secondary veins are 
said to be simple or once forked, while iu the broader form the 
veins are repeatedly forked. This supposed distinction does not 
hold as a satisfactory means of identification; in both the long, 
and narrow as well as in the broader fronds we find the same 
manner of forking in the lateral veins. The differences indeed 
between T. vittata and T, major are barely sufficient to wan'ant 
a specific separation, but as the gi'eater breadth of T. major appears 
to be a fairly constant character, as well as other small differences, 
it is probably better to retain both names. 

Nathorst "^ has suggested that T. major may be an entire leaf 
of Anomo%amites Lindleyanus, but this is, I think, improbable. 
The best specimen in the British Museum Collection is the clearly 
preserved portion of a leaf associated with some impressions pf 
Marchantites erectus (Leek.) (JS'o. 39,328) ; this form of frond, 
however, is not well represented. 

It is not improbable that the short and broad leaf described 
by Lindley & Hutton as Otopteris ovalis ^ may be the young frond

of T. major, as Nathorst suggests ; * but the type-specimen in the 
Scarborough Museum is too imperfect and indistinct to enable 
one to form any decided opinion as to its nature ; the veins ai'e 
too indefinite to be made out. It is probably wiser under these 
circumstances to omit this * species,' which has been referred to

Genus SAGENOPTERIS, Presl. 
[Sternberg, Flor. Vorwelt, vii, p. 164, 1838.] 

The position of the genus Sagenopteris in the plant kingdom is 
still undecided. More than one writer has placed this Mesozoic 
plant in the Marsiliaceae,'^ but, as I have elsewhere pointed out,* 
the eWdence on which this conclusion is based is hardly satisfactory. 
While admitting the absence of such characters as might enable 
us to speak with any degree of certainty as to systematic position, 
I am disposed to regard Sagenopteris as probably a genus of ferns. 
Fontaine * has figured some leaflets of Sagenopteris from the 
Potomac beds beaiing small dot-like elevations, which may be 
the remains of sori or sporangia. He regards the specimens as 
favouring the inclusion of Sagenopteris among the ferns.

SAGENOPTERIS. 163 

Type-specimms. Brongniart's type in the Paris Museum (?) ; that 
■of Otopteris cimeata of Lindley & Hutton in the Manchester 
Museum. The specimens figured by Phillips (pi. viii. fig. 8) and 
bj- Lindley & Hutton (pi. Ixiii.) are in the York and British 
Museums respectively. 

Frond very variable, petiolate ; in some forms the petiole bears 
four linear lanceolate leaflets having a distinct midiib and oblique 
anastomosing lateral veins ; in other fonns a shoi'ter winged petiole 
bears one or two shoi'ter and broader, somewhat obcuneate leaflets 
without a midrib and traversed by spreading anastomosing veins. 

The figures published by Brongniart of this species represent 
the leaves with dichotomous but not anastomosing secondary 
veins ; one of the drawings was commiinicated to him by Professor 
Phillips and another was drawn from a specimen supplied by 
Dr. Murray. At a later date Brongniart instituted a new genus 
Phjllopteria * to include the leaves previously identified as 
Glossopteris Phillipgii ; the specimens figtired by Lindley & 
Hutton under the latter name are refen-ed by the French author 
to Sagenopteris. This separation of the Yorkshire fossils into 
two genera, Phyllopteris and SagenopterU^ was the result of 
incorrect representation of the venation in some of the earlier 
figures ; there is, however, no doubt as to the identity of the 
plants figured by Brongniart and Lindley & Hutton. 

In plate civ. of the Fossil Flora a smaller form of leaf with 
anastomosing venation is represented under the name Otopteris 
cuneata ; these specimens agree as reganls the anastomosing veins 
with the longer and narrower leaves which the authors referred 
to Glossopteris Phillipsii, but differ in the absence of a midrib and 
in having fewer leaflets on each frond. The original specimen 
of one of the drawings in plate civ. of the Fossil Flora is now in 
the Manchester Museum.* 

In 1851 Bunbury discussed at some length the affinities of 
Otopteris cuneata, L. & H. ; he considered that this species " is 
merely an imperfect or abnormal state — probably a seedling — of 
Sagenopteris Phillipsiy Speaking of a specimen in Mr. Bean's 
collection, which is in all probability No. 39,311 in the British

or seedling fronds of recent ferns." In the third edition of 
Phillips' Geology of the Yorkshire Coast it is also suggested that 
this cuneate form may be specifically identical with the longer- 
leaved Sagenopteris PMlUpsi} Some leaflets fi'om Australia figured 
by Feistmantel ^ as Glossopteris spathulata-cordata bear a close 
resemblance to Sagenopteris Phillipsi, var. cuneata. 

Although it is impossible to decide the question of identity 
of Sagenopteris Phillipsi and S. cuneata, I am inclined to agree 
with Bunbury that it is at least reasonable to suppose that both 
forms of leaf wei'e borne by the same species. Evidence of the 
variation in the form of the leaf displayed by this genus is furnished 
by numerous specimens (in the British and other Museums) of what 
no one would hesitate to refer to S. Phillipsi : the size of the 
leaflets varies considerably; the proportion of breadth to length 
and the distinctness or prominence of the midrib are characters 
subject to considerable variation. Again, in the scries of figures 
of the Rhsetic species Sagenopteris rhoifolia (Presl), and in the 
di'awings of species of this genus published by Zigno and Nathorst, 
we have abundant proof of the variability displayed by the leaflets. 

There is a reference in the later edition of Phillips' work and 
in the more recent notes on Jurassic plants by Nathorst to a larger 
fonn of Sagenopteris leaflet, represented in the Leckenby Collection 
and elsewhere, which agrees closely with S. Goeppertiana described 
by Zigno from the Italian Oolites. A leaf flgured by Feistmantel ^ 
as Sagenopteris, sp., may also be compared with this larger tj-pe of 
S. Phillipsi. This form of leaflet is represented in Fig. 26, drawn 
from a specimen in the Scarborough Museum ; a still larger 
example of this form in the Manchester Museum has a length of 
11 cm.* 

In spite of the striking difference between such a leaflet as that 
shown in Text-fig. 26 and the leaflets represented in Figs. 2-4 of

SAGENOPTEEIS. 165 

PI. XVII I. and Text -fig. 24, I believe it is the better plan to 
include all under one specific name, and as a matter of convenience 
to refer to the very small and very large forms as Sagenopt&ris 
Phillipn, var, cuneata, and 8. Phillipsi, var. major, respectively. 
Such a method of designating by descriptive varietal names extreme 
tj-pes of leaves which may be connected by a fairly complete series 
of transitional forms, and which there is no sufficient reason for 
refomng to as to distinct species, may in some cases prove 
convenient. 

The English species of Sagenopteris, 8. Phillipai, differs from 
8. rhoifolia and from 8. Goeppertiana chiefly in the longer and 
narrower form of the leaflets, but the lai'ger type of leaf such 
as that shown in Text-fig. 26, and the intermediate forms repre- 
sented by fig. 1, pi. Ixiii. of Lindley & Hutton (No. 39,221 in the 
Museum Collection), agree very closely with Schonk's figures of 
8. rhoifolia,^ and with those given by Zigno of 8. Goeppertiana^ 
The specimens from Australia, figured by Fcistmantel as 8. rhoifolia,^ 
are very similar to many of the forms of 8. Phillipsi. In a letter 
written by Bean* to Lindley in 1832 accompanj-ing the di'a wings 
afterwards published in the Fossil Flora (pi. Ixiii.), the broader- 
leaved form is named Pecopteris Bunnii, but this designation, like 
many of Bean's manuscript names, was never adopted. Some of 
the naiTowcr- leaved foi-ms of 8. Phillipsi may be compared with 
8. angustifolia, Zigno,' and with 8. undulata, Nathorst.' 

A fi-agmcnt recently figured by Shii-ley from Queensland as 
Sagenopteris cuneata ' is too small for accurate determination.

This example, which agrees closely with those figured by Lindley & 
Hutton as Otopteria cwieata,^ consists of a stalk 4 mm. wide, with 
a thick median portion and thin lateral wings, bearing two cuneiform 
segments. The segments have a fairly well-marked midrib, dividing 
the lamina into unequal portions ; the secondary veins exhibit the 
same kind of anastomoses as in the longer segments of PI. XVIII. 
Fig. 4. The general appearance of these specimens reminds one 
of the small leaves in Pavia and other Dicotyledons, which are 
intermediate between bud -scales and true foliage leaves. The 
question of the specific identity of these smaller forms and the 
longer-leaved type has been discussed in the introductory remarks 
on Sagenopteris PhilUpsii.

is no definite midrib, but the lamina is traversed by spreading 
and anastomosing veins. Bunbury refers to this specimen in his 
remarks on Sagenopteris cuneata, L. & H. A similar specimen, in 
which a short petiole terminates in a single leaflet, may be seen 
in the Scarborough Museum.

4-5 cm. long and 1*6 cm. broad, with a distinct midrib and long

leaf forms a more or less intermediate foim between the long

Genus PACHYPTERIS, Brongniart. 

[Prodrome, p. 49, and Hiatoire, p. 166, 1828.] 

Brongniart instituted this genus in 1828, defining it as follows : 
""Foliae pinnatae vel bipinnatoe, pinnulis integris coriaceis enerviis 

' Zigno (56), pis. xxi. and xxii. 
2 Nathorst (78»), pi, iv. fig. 2. 



170 PACHYPTERIS. 

vel uninerviis, basi constrictis nee rachi adnatis." ^ He notes- 
the form of the pinnules, which are never lobed, and the absence 
of veins as characteristic features. Brongniart and many other 
authors place Pachypteris among the ferns, but in 1845 Unger'^ 
included the genus among the "Cycadacese dubiae," and Andrae^ 
regarded it as a member of the Taxinese. Zigno instituted the 
genus Bichopteris for ferns having bipinnate fronds characterized by 
a stout rachis bearing linear pinnae with short lanceolate or ovate- 
segments traversed by several veins. A specimen figured by thi& 
author as a portion of a fertile frond of Bichopteris microphylla, 
Zigno/ has been accepted by Schimper and others as definitely 
settling the fern-nature of the genus. This critical example 
I regard as a piece of a fertile frond of Todites ; the pinnules 
agree in shape and in the arrangement of the sporangia with 
the fertile segments of Todites Williamsoni (Brongn.).^ In 1873 
Saporta proposed a new genus Scleropteris for several imperfectly 
known species previously referred to Pomel's genus Laxopteris, 
to Sphenopteris, Bichopteris, and Pachypteris.^ It is probable that 
more than one generic type of plant is included in Saporta's 
genus ; some of the species are undoubtedly ferns, while others, 
formerly referred to Pachypteris or Bichopteris, may possibly be 
Cycadean. In placing Pachypteris among the ferns of doubtful 
aflinity, it is not intended to imply that the evidence available 
renders that position in any sense established. The argument 
advanced by Brongniart against Unger's reference of Pachypteris 
to the Cycads, that no Cycad is known with bipinnate fronds, 
cannot be maintained; in the Australian genus Bowenia we have 
a well-known instance of a Cycad with bipinnate leaves, and it 
is very probable that this form of leaf was not infrequently borne 
by stems having the structure of Cycads. Kecent research has 
thoroughly established the closest affinity between Cycadean and 
Filicinean types in the PalsBozoic epoch, and there is evidence that 
during the Mesozoic period the distinction between Ferns and

Cycads was mucli less marked than at the present day. It may 
well be that Pachypteris is an extinct type in which fern-like 
fronds were attached to a stem possessing the structure of a Cycad. 
"We have recently been taught to recognize the intimate association, 
and indeed the common origin, of Ferns and Cycads, and we 
cannot expect, in dealing with fronds alone, to be able to draw 
a sharp line of distinction between these two classes of the plant- 
kingdom. The view that Pachypteris may represent an extinct 
genus intermediate between Cycads and Ferns was held by Braun 
in 1854, and this may well be the nearest approach to the tnith. 
In a recent paper on Cretaceous plants fi'om Lesina, Krasser* has 
given the history of the genus Pachypteris ; this author discussea 
at length the aflBuiity of the genus, which he includes among the 
CycadaceaB.

T^pe-specimens. The type-specimens of Phillips are said to be 
in the York Museum, but I was unable to identify them among 
the plants in that collection. The example figured by Saporta 
[(73), pi. xiv. fig. 3] is in the Scarborough Museum (Text-fig. 28). 

Frond bipinnate ; rachis stout ; the linear pinnae bear thick 
ultimate segments obliquely inclined to the axis, lanceolate or 
of narrow oval form with an entire or slightly lobed margin ; 
veins very indistinct, probably more than one in each pinnule. 

The material afforded by the East Yorkshire plant-beds is too 
fragmentary and insufficient to enable us to give a satisfactory 
diagnosis of the species to which the English specimens are 
referred. It is not improbable that more than one specific type 
is represented by the two examples shown in Text-figs. 27 and 28, 
but in view of the meagre data and the probable variation in the 
form of the pinnae and pinnules in one large frond, it is wiser to 
refrain from any attempt at specific separation. 

The specimens which Brongniart named Fachypteris lanceolata 
and P. ovata were obtained from a locality near "Whitby ; they 
are specifically identical with the portions of fronds figured by 
Phillips in 1829 as Sphenopteris ? lanceolata and Neuropteris 
Itsvigata. Saporta, in discussing the English specimens, points 
out that Brongniart's description of the pinnules as being without 
^^sible veins, or as having a single vein, is not accurate, the 
lamina of each ultimate segment being traversed by several veins. 
The few fragments of Pachypterk obtained from English localities

do not afford any evidence of the existence of a single midrib 
in the pinnules, as figured by Brongniart. In all probability the 
thick pinnules were traversed by several veins, as shown in 
Zigno's figures of Italian specimens. Saporta considers Pachypteris 
ovata of Brongniart identical with Neuropteris Icevigata of Phillips, 
and changes the latter name to Scleropteris Itsvigata ; the figure

form of the pinnae between a large specimen described by Saporta

Class CYCADALES. 



The term Cycadales is used as a comprehensive designation to- 
include certain fossil genera which are usually spoken of as- 
Cycads, but do not conform to the accepted definition of the 
existing Cycadaceae. It is well known that the Mcsozoic Period 
was characterized botanically by the abundance of plants bearing 
pinnate fronds very similar to those of recent Cycads. These 
extinct types, at least in some cases, have been shown to differ 
essentially from the modern Cycadaceae in their reproductive 
structures, which diverge too widely from the type represented 
by the flowers of living Cycads to admit of the inclusion of the 
fossil genera in the family Cycadaceae. It has been found 
convenient, therefore, to make use of the class-name Cycadales 
to include both the existing Cycadaceae and certain fossil genera 
of which the floral structures are known, with others with which 
we are acquainted only as regards their leaves or stems. 

Amongst the Jurassic Cycadean genera we have the type 
Williamsonia, which is of special interest as representing an 
extinct division of the Cycadales definitely marked off from the true 
Cycads by the morphology of the floral organs ; this division is 
spoken of as the Bennettiteae. Other Cycadean genera abundantly 
represented in the Jurassic flora cannot at present be referred 
with certainty either to the Bennettiteae or to the Cycadaceae; 
these may be dealt with as types of Cycadales, without being 
included in either of the two families or divisions. It is probable 
that the genus Anomozamites ^ should be included with Williamsonia 
as a member of the Bennettiteae.

Family BENNETTITE^. 

Uncler this head we include the genus Williamsonia, which 
may be conveniently retained as a Mesozoic type closely allied 
to Bennettites. There appears to he good evidence also in favour 
of including the genus Anomozamites in the Bennettitese. In 
the second volume of the Wealden Catalogue ^ I have used 
Williamsonia in the sense of a subgenus of Bennettites, and it 
is possible that this is the wiser course to adopt ; on the other 
hand, we are less intimately acquainted with the plants usually 
refeiTcd to Williamsonia than witli the original species of Bennettites, 
and it is a convenience to retain the former name as denoting 
a member of the Bennettitea) which has long been known as 
a Jurassic genus oi doubtful affinity.

2. Williamsonia pecten (Phillips). 

The history of Williamsonia was dealt with at length in the second 
volume of the Wmldefi Catalogue, and need not be recapitulated. - 
Since my account of Williamsonia was written I have had an 
opportunity of examining several specimens of the genus, and from 
some of them, more paiticularly from English examples in the 
Natural History Museum, Paris, I have been able to satisfy 
myself that Williamson's restoration of the Yorkshire Oolite 
plant ' — Williamsonia gigas — is in essentials correct. The 
pinnate Cycadean fi'onds described in 1835 as Zamia gigas were 
undoubtedly borne on a stem which presented an appearance 
practically identical with that of most recent Cycads; the same 
stem also bore flowering shoots which tenninated in flowers

Type-specimens. The specimens of flowers figured by Williamson 
are in the possession of Mrs. Crawford Williamson. Those figured 
by Phillips and by Young & Bird are in the Whitby Museum. 
[The original of Mantell's figure of the flower published in the 
Medals of Creation (p. 16) is in the Museum of Practical Geolog}*, 
Jermyn Street. London.] 

Main stem similar to the ordinarj- type of Cycadean trunk in 
being covered with persistent bases of petiole. Leaves pinnate, 
agreeing in habit with the fronds of most recent species of Cycadaceae ; 
the crowded linear lanceolate pinna? with acuminate apices are 
attached to the upper face of the rachis by their slightly rounded 
bases, which were probably swollen, as in several recent species in 
which the pinnae possess a basal callosity. The stiff lamina of the 
pinnae is traversed by several parallel, or slightly spreading, and 
occasionally forked veins. The lower part of the rachis is prolonged 
below the basal pinme as a petiole attached by a swollen base to 
the stem. The pinnae are for the most part given off from the rachis 
at a wide angle ; in the lower portion of the frond the pinnae are 
shorter and broader and almost at right angles to the axis ; in the 
middle of the fi'ond they are more crowded, longer, and given off 
at an acute angle, while towards the apex of the frond they are 
narrower, and attached at a much more acute angle, or almost 
parallel to the rachis. 

From the main stem were given off one or more comparatively 
slender branches ('peduncles ') bearing linear acuminate scale-leaves 
often clothed with ramenta ; each of these branches terminated in 
an ovoid flower surrounded by Uncar bracts, and probably agreeing 
in structure with the flower of Bennettites. 

The above description is far from complete, but it is intended 
to convey a general rather than a detailed view of the plant as 
a whole. In all probability the flowers of the genus Williamsonia 
agreed in essentials with those of the Lower Cretaceous and Wealden 
Bennettites, but unfortunately the absence of internal structure 



180 -yVILLIAMSONrA. 

prevents us speaking with certainty as to the floral charactci-s 
of Williamsonia gigas. During the last few years numerous' 
silicified stems of Bcnnettites have been discovered in North American 
beds, and a preliminarj- account of the flowers of some of these 
species by Mr. Wieland,^ of jN'ewhaven, leads us to look forward 
with considerable interest to the publication of his more detailed 
work. One of the most interesting points brought to light by 
Wieland's work concerns the nature of the male reproductive 
organs. I am indebted to the courtesy of this investigator for 
a section through the male sporophylls of a flower, which shows 
very clearly several sporangia containing microspores (pollen- 
grains). The microspores bear a striking resemblance to those- 
of recent Cycads. 

In describing the specimens of Williamsonia gigas in the British 
Museum, I have drawn attention to several features which enable 
us to obtain a fairly comprehensive view of the external characters 
of this interesting type of the Bennettitea). 

The specific name Zamia i{f(^?^^e//^ instituted in 1828 by Brongniai't 
was afterwards quoted by this author as a sj-nonym of Zamites 
gigas, L. «fe H. For this reason, and because the latter name has. 
been generally adopted, the older specific designation is discarded. 
The earliest figure of an English specimen of this species was 
published by Young & Bird in 1822.- The fronds of Williamsonia 
gigas (L. & H.) represent a type of Cycadean foliage which was 
abundant and widely distributed during the Jurassic period ; it is 
very difficult to decide which of the many pinnate fronds of the 
Zamites type should be included under W. gigas. Some at least of 
the fronds described by French authors from Jurassic rocks are no 
doubt specifically identical with the Yorkshire plant, but it is not 
improbable that other species, not included in the above synonymy, 
might reasonably be referred to the English type. A collection 
of Yorkshire specimens in the Natural Historj- Museum, Paris, 
contains some of the most important examples of Williamsoniir 
gigas, and an examination of these fossils has aided me considei^ably 
in forming an opinion as to the close affinity of Williamsonia with 
Bennettites.

WnXIAMSONIA. 181 

The late Professor Williamson devoted a considerable time 
tlnring the earliest years of his scientific life to the investigation 
of the fossils to which Carruthers gave the name Williamsonia. 
iS'o one has had opportunities of studying this genus as it 
occurs in the rocks near Scarborough equal to those enjoyed by 
Williamson ; and it is interesting to find that the most recent 
work has tended to support many of the conclusions arrived at 
by this observer. As early as 1834 Williamson' expressed the 
opinion that Zamites gigas was connected with Williamsonia, and 
in his very able paper, published in 1870,^ this author is confirmed 
in the view of the organic connection of these two sets of fossils. 
This opinion was shared also by Brongniart,' who received an 
•unusually fine collection of English Williamsonias from the late 
Mr. Yates. These specimens are now in the Natural Historj- 
iluseum, Paris, and many of them were drawn for Brongniart 
with a view to publication, but the work was unfortunately 
never completed. The drawings were aftcrwai-ds made use of 
by Saportti in his comprehensive work on Jurassic plants. In 
describing the Yates specimens, Saporta expresses himself strongly 
^igainst the generally accepted view as to the union of Williamsonia 
and Zamites. He does not hesitate to separate the Zamites fronds 
from any connection with the Williamsonias. There is, he admits, 
*' une certaine conformite appareute entrc les appareils floraux 
auxquels on pout loisser le nom de Williamsonia et le Zamites 
gigas, tel (^uc le fait voir le remarquable empreinte de la collection 
du Museum de Paiis (voy. pi. Ixxxi. fig. 1). Xous avons tout bien

d'une monocotyledone primitive, revelant un type de Pandanees 
plus ou moins analogue aux Yuccites, aux Podocarya, aux JSolirion 
de Andrae, etc." * 

A recent examination of the Yates Collection in Paris, and 
a comparison of the numerous specimens in the Museums of 
London, Cambridge, Whitby, Scarborough, Leeds, and other towns, 
have led me without hesitation to regard the pinnate Cycadean

182 WILUAMSONIA. 

fronds of Zamites gigas as the leaves of the plant which bore 
a Williamsonian inflorescence. 

One not infrequently finds a small bud or young Wtlliamsonia 
borne on the end of a peduncle about 20 or 30 cm. long and 3 to 
5 cm. broad. The peduncle is covered with linear lanceolate scale- 
leaves spirally disposed and often clothed with delicate hair-like 
ramenta, such as occur on the scale-leaves of Dioon and other recent 
Cycads. A peduncle of this kind is figured by Saporta in pi. xv. 
of vol. iv.^ The original is in the Paris Museum ; the scale- 
leaves are less prominent and not so thick as those shown in the 
drawing, and in this and other specimens one sees traces of the 
ramental appendages. The best example of a peduncle is included 
in the series of specimens of Williamsonia now in the possession of 
Mrs. Crawford Williamson, to whom my thanks are due for an 
opportunity afforded me of examining the fossils figured in 
Professor Williamson's valuable memoir. 

Saporta alludes to the resemblance of the peduncle which he- 
figures to the stem of Zamites gigaa,- represented in his volume 
on Cycads (pi. xi. fig. 1), but he does not regard the similarity as 
evidence of relationship or identity. This specimen of Zamites 
referred to in the above quotation, from the second volume of the 
Plantes Jurassiques^ is of exceptional interest and furnishes the most 
important link in the argument in favour of the connection between 
Williamsonia and Zamites gigas. Saporta's figure is very imperfect,, 
and conveys but a poor and erroneous idea of the actual specimen. 
In the lower part of the figure is shown a stem about 5 cm. 
broad, with the surface features indistinctly preserved, but showing 
a number of imperfect scale-leaves. To one side of the stem, 5 cm.. 
from the bottom of the specimen, are attached the petioles of two 
clearly preserved fronds of Zamites gigas, and above these occurs 
part of a third frond apparently in its natural position but without 
the petiolar attachment. The stem is prolonged obliquely upward* 
to the left in the form of a branch about 3 cm. broad and 14 cm. 
long. This branch is thickly clothed with hairy leaf-scales, and 
terminates in numerous spreading leaf-scales of a narrow linear 
lanceolate form. The position and surface features of this branch 



Saporta (91). 
Saporta (75), p. 55. 



WIIilAMSONIA. 183 

are very inadequately and incorrectly reproduced in Saporta's 
figure. If we now turn to the specimen figured by the same 
author as a peduncle of TFilltamsonia,^ and which terminates in 
what appears to be a closed Williamsonian inflorescence, we find the 
characters are identical with those of the branch of the stem which 
bears the Zamites fronds. Specimens of peduncles in the British 
Museum, and others in the collections of "Whitby, Scarboi'ough, and 
Leeds, afford similar proof of the identity of the detached peduncles 
and the obliquely placed branch of the leaf-bearing stem. There 
can be little doubt that the terminal bud-like structure on these 
peduncles is a young and unexpanded Williamsonia, but even if 
this be disputed, there can be no question as to the identity of 
the typical scale-leaves of Williamsonia and those of the terminal 
bud on the peduncles. 

A specimen in the Whitby Museum shows a stem bearing two 
diverging peduncles, and evidence of the same habit of growth is 
afforded by an example in the British Museum. In all probability 
the stem figured by Saporta' bore another peduncle in addition 
to that shown in the figure ; this is suggested not only by the 
examination of other specimens but also by the oblique position 
of the peduncle, which is not brought out in the figure. The 
restoration of Zamites given by Williamson in his well-known 
paper ^ accurately represents what I believe to have been the 
manner of attachment of the infiorescence and foliage-leaves to 
the main stem. * 

The whole subject of the Bennettitese and other fossil Cycadales 
will be more fully dealt with in a forthcoming monograph on 
British Cycads to be published by the Palteontographical Society. 

Specimens of both the fi'onds and flowers of Williamsonia gigas are 
abundantly represented in the British Museum, and in the Natural 
History Museum, Paris. Examples of fronds in the Newcastle 
and Paris Museums suggest that the segments had an imbricated 
arrangement in the young condition. Specimens of peduncles 
are by no means common ; the best are those in the Museums of 
Paris, Cambridge, Scarborough, Whitby, and Leeds. No undoubted

examples of seeds have been discovered in connection with the 
reproductive organs, but in a transverse section cut through 
a small flower at the apex of a peduncle (Scarborough Museum) 
one or two oval depressions were noticed, which maj be due to 
the presence of small seeds. The best examples of WilUamsonia 
flowers are those in the Yates Collection, Paris, and the specimens 
figured by the late Professor "Williamson, which are now in the 
possession of Mrs. Crawford Williamson. 

a. Fronds and Stem. 

V. 2723a. PI. V. (and PL VII. Fig. 2). 

This is a good example of a small frond of WilUamsonia gigas ; 
it measures 23 cm. in length, and illustrates the characteristic 
habit of the leaf and the form and manner of attachment of the 
pinnae. The rachis is comparatively slender, and bears on its upper 
surface numerous alternately disposed linear lanceolate pinnse with 
rounded bases and acuminately pointed tips ; the basal portion 
of some of the pinnse is slightly hollowed out in the centre and 
suggests the original presence of a callus. At the apex of the frond 
the pinnae are narrow and linear, and at the actual tip they are almost 
parallel to the I'achis ; in the lower portion of the frond the pinnae 
are shorter and broader, and approximately at right angles to the 
rachis, while in the middle of the frond they are more crowded, 
longer, and given off at a different angle. 

This frond should be compared with Saporta's figures of Zamites 
Feneonis, Brongn.,^ which I regard as specifically identical with 
WilUamsonia gigas, and with Andrae's figures of Zamites Schmiedelii, 
Stemb.'' 

V. 2722a. PI. VII. Fig. 4. 

This figure shows the swollen base of a petiole of a frond more 
than 60 cm. in length, of which the apical portion has not been 
preserved ; when complete, it must have been about 80 cm. long. 
The petiole has a length of 11cm., and terminates below in 
a thick, irregularly oval base.

Well-presen'cd examples of the stem of Williamsom'a giga^ are 
rarely met with ; the figure represents the only specimen in 
the British Museum Collection in which any surface-features are 
-shown. A similar specimen may be seen in the Woodwardian 
Museum, Cambridge (Leckenby Coll., Jso. 203). The persistent leaf- 
bases are shown as spirally disposed projecting areas recalling the 
appearance of recent Cycadean stems; the concave termination at 
the top of the specimen probably represents the position of 
a flowering axis such as we know were borne by the stems of 
Williamsonia. The stem measures 9 cm. in length and 5*5 in 
breadth. Fragments of fronds and flowers are associated with this 
piece of stem, and on the reverse side of the specimen there is 
-a good example of a disc like that of 38,785 (PI. VIII. Fig. 1).

absence of any definite Otozamitea * ear ' point to Zamites as 
the generic type rather than to Otozamitea. Cf. Otozamitea

V. 3942. A frond 53 cm. long. This specimen is preserved in 
sandstone, and does not show the details so clearly as many of 
the other examples of this species, but it affords a good illustration 
of the danger of relying too much on the published figures of 
fossil fronds. If this frond were drawn as it appears on the 
sandstone, the pinnae would seem to have broad basal portions 
rapidly tapering towards the apex ; in reality the breadth of the 
pinnae is fairly uniform to within a short distance of the apex, but 
owing to the oblique position of the pinnae in the sandstone matrix, 
a considerable portion of the lower edges is hidden and would not 
be seen in a drawing or photograph. 

38.760. A splendid frond 45 cm. in length, including the 
petiole, which measures 4*5 cm., widening towards the base. 
This frond is unusually complete, showing both the apical and 
basal pinnae. The tips of the pinnae are seen to vary considerably : 
in some the upper and lower margins bend gradually downwards 
and upwards respectively towards the symmetrically placed 
acuminate apex ; in some the apex points upwards ; and in others 
the lower margin of the pinnae is almost straight, while the 
upper margin bends strongly downwards and gives the apex the 
appearance of pointing slightly downwards.

The figured specimen, which occurs in association with the frond 
shown in PI. V., consists of a flowering axis or peduncle, 16 cm. 
long, covered with compressed bracts bearing ramenta ; the 
peduncle has a diameter of about 3 cm. The summit of the axis 
was originally occupied by a flower or bud, of which the basal 
portion only has been preserved. One of the best specimens of 
a branch of this kind I have met with is in the Leeds Museum.

individual linear bracts, which are identical in surface-markings

axial part of the peduncle has not been preserved ; the figured 
portion shows the ca\'ity originally occupied by the axis, surrounded 
by very clearly preserved scale -leaves which thickly covered its 
surface. In Fig. 3 one of the scale-leaves {x in Fig. 1 ) is shown on 
a larger scale : it has the form of a hollow shell with a compressed 
lozenge-shaped central portion, which was originally occupied by 
the ground tissue and vascular bundles ; the shell no doubt 
represents the more resistent sclerenchymatous hypoderm, the 
surface-striations being the expression of the longitudinal course of 
the bands of mechanical tissue which occurred below the epidermis.

■end is shown in the Text-figure ; the axial portion is elliptical 
in shape, and is surrounded by the linear scale-leaves, which in 
Fig. 1 are seen in surface -view ; these bracts are represented in 
the Text-figure by somewhat crushed shells of hypodermal tissue 
enclosing spaces bounded on the outside by convex walls, and 
internally, where the bracts are in contact with the axis, by more 
or less straight walls, as shown in the upper part of the figure-

The disc was originally circular, as we know fi'om other 
specimens, the centre being shown at the base of the figure in 
PI. VIII. As seen in surface-view, the disc has the form of 
a cup-shaped, irregularly striated, carbonaceous membrane, breaking 
up at the periphery into several long and tapering bracts. The 
continuous portion of the disc has a iliametor of 8*5 cm. It is 
probable that this organ was originally attached to the summit 
of a Williamsonia flower, but we have no satisfactory evidence 
as to its function.*^ Portions of fi-onds occur on the same piece

Frond piimate, long and narrow ; uniform in breadth and 
variable as regards the shape and size of the pinnae. The crowded 
pinnae are attached to the upper face of the rachis at a more 
or less acute angle ; the bases of the pinnae ai"e either of the 
same breadth as the rest of the lamina and have rounded corners 
or, in some cases, the upper edge of the base is slightly expanded 
as a basal lobe similai" to the auriculate base of an Otozamites 
pinna. The pinnae vary in shape : some are short and comparatively 
broad, while others arc long and naiTOw (vide PI. III.), their 
apices ai*e either gradually tapering and acuminate, or the upper 
margin may be almost straight and the lower edge suddenly curved 
upwards to the pointed tip. The veins ai'e spreading at the base 
of the pinna and approximately parallel thi'ough the gi'cater part of 
the lamina. The petiole is slightly expanded laterally towards the 
base, which separates by a clean-cut absciss-layer fi'om the stem 
(vide PL III. Fig. 7). 

The flowers appear to be of the same type as those of 
Williamsonia gigas, but of smaller size, and characterized by the 
shoi'ter and proportionately broader linear acuminate or lanceolate 
bracts. The York Museum contains a specimen very similar to 
that shown in Text-fig. 32. 



192 WILLI AMSONIA. 

Although the pinnate fronds, which were named by Lindley & 
Hutton Cycadites peden and C. pectinoides, have never been 
found in organic union with the type of Williamsonia described 
by Nathorst as W. Leckenhji,^ there can be little, if any, doubt 
that the latter is the flower of the plant which bore the well- 
known pinnate leaves long known by Phillips' name Pterophyllum 
pecten. The constant association of the small species of Williamsonia 
with these fronds is in itself a strong argument for their specific 
identity. The extremely variable form of the fronds is at once 
apparent if we examine carefully the numerous examples of 
this species in the various British and Continental collections. 
In addition to the specimens in the British Museum illustrating 
the frequent association of various forms of Williamsonia pecten on 
one piece of shale, equally instructive examples may be seen in 
the Museums of Scarborough, York, and Manchester. One slab 
of rock in the Scarborough Museum shows about thirty fronds 
in which there is considerable variation in the breadth of the 
pinnae. Specimens in the Manchester Museum also demonstrate 
the variability of the species : one frond 24 cm. in length bears 
pinnae with bluntly rounded bases and the upper basal edge 
distinctly lobed (auriculatc) (cf. V. 3516, etc.), and in close 
association with this occur other examples in which the pinnae 
are smaller and without a basal lobe. The fossils originally 
named by Brongniart Zamia Goldicei, and afterwards figured by 
Saporta as Otozamites Goldiai,"^ arc, I have no doubt, specifically 
identical with Williamsonia pecten ; but the latter name is very 
much better known, and the form of frond to which the 
designation pecten was first applied represents the more typical 
form. A Liassic Otozamites described by Lignier from Normandy 
as 0. Apperti ^ may also be compared with Williamsonia pecten ; 
the pinnae are slightly lobed at the base, and, as Lignier points 
out, they resemble Otozamites Ooldicei. 

An important question is the affinity of several Cycadean fronds 
from Indian beds, which Feistmantel included in the genus 
Ftilopht/llum, proposed by Morris in 1840, with the English fronds 
usually referred to Pterophyllum, and now spoken of as Williamsonia

pecten. Morris defined Ptilophyllum as follows : " Fronds pinnate, 
pinnse closely approximated, linear, lanceolate, more or less 
elongate, imbricate at the base, attached obliqiiely ; base semi- 
circular or rounded ; veins equal, slender, parallel." ' In this 
diagnosis there is nothing to justify a separation from the type 
represented by TTilliamsonia pecten. I have no hesitation in 
expressing the opinion that there is practically no difference 
between such fronds as Ptilophyllum cutcliense, Morr., P. tetter rimum, 
Feist., P. acutifolium, Morr., and Williamsonia pecten. 

A careful examination of Morris' tj'pe- specimen of Ptilophyllum 
cutchense (in the Museum of the Geological Society of London), 
and of several other Indian specimens in the British Museum, has 
convinced me that a generic separation of the Indian and European 
fossils serves to mislead and indicates a distinction which does 
not exist. It is by no means cei'tain that the two sets of fossils 
are specifically identical ; probably they arc not, but there is at 
least no difference worthy of generic rank. In several instances 
there has been a tendency to exaggerate the difference between 
the Gondwana floras and the floras of corresponding ago in Europe. 

The occurrence of Williamsonia flowers in the Indian beds, and 
the existence of Cycadean stems like that shown in Text-fig. 30, 
demonstrate the close correspondence, as regai'ds some members 
of the Cycadales, between Indian and European plants during 
the Mesozoic period. The specimen shown in Text-fig. 30 is of 
interest as affording an example of a stem from India, which 
presents a very close agreement with a typical Cycadean trunk. 
The surface of the trunk (A) is covered with persistent leaf-bases, 
to which fronds of the tj'pe Ptilophyllum cutchense were attached ; 
in a section of the stem (B) a large pith is seen to occupy the axial 
region, and this is suiTounded by a zone of secondary wood, which 
appeal's to differ from the characteristic wood of existing Cycads 
in having a more compact structure. The broad parenchymatous 
medullarj'-rays form a striking feature in the wood of a recent 
Cycad, but in the Indian stem, so far as it is possible to examine 
the structure in detail, the medullarj'-rays are naiTOw, and more 
like those of Conifers than Cycads. The lozenge-shaped areas

I hope to describe elsewhere, and in more detail, the

as throwing light on the nature of the stems which bore some 
of the best known Cycadean fronds. Before describing the

th.c specimens of WilUamsonia pecten shown in PI. III. Fig. 4 and 
in PI. III. Fig. 6, but there is no indication of any aurieulate 
upper edge at the base of the pinnae. The veins in Andrae's 
specimen should have been di-awn rather more spreading or oblique 
to the edge of the lamina in the basal portion of the pinnae. This 
plant, I believe, is specifically identical with WilUamsonia pecten. 

Text-fig. 32. 

These two drawings represent portions of fronds of the Indian 
species figui'ed by Morris, Oldham & Morris, and Fiestmantel as 
Palceozamia cutchensis or Ptilophyllum cutchense from the Kajmahal 
Hills. The small basal pinnae (B) have the upper edge of the base 
free, and agree precisely in this respect with the small basal pinnae 
of WilUamsonia pecten (cf. Text-fig. 33). Fig. 32a shows the 
lower portions of a few pinnae attached to the rachis ;■ each pinna 
is 1*4 cm. long and 3mm. broad; the veins are slightly spreading 
from the base and diverge at the apex, being repeatedly branched 
as they pass through the lamina. The drawing was made fi'om 
one of several fronds preserved in unusual perfection in a siliceous 
rock, where they occur in association with Bictyozamites} 

There is a close resemblance between the Portuguese frond from 
Capo Mondego figured by Monis "^ and by Heer ^ respectively as 
Otozamites fframineus, var. MundcB, and Otozamites angustifolius, 
and some of the examples of WilUamsonia pecten ; the original of 
the drawing given by Morris and copied by Heer is in the British 
Museum Collection (41,371). It is not improbable that the English 
specimens from the Stonesfield Slate named by Lindley & Hutton 
Zamia taxina arc specifically identical with the East Yorkshire 
plant. 

Specimens of WilUamsonia pecten are abundantly represented in 
collections of English Jurassic plants, more particularly in the 
Museums of Scarborough, Cambridge, Newcastle, and Manchester. 
In the Natural Historj- Museum, Paris, there is an example of this 
species labelled Otozamites hrevifoliuSy from Scarborough, the gift 
of Dr. MantcU.

The figure represents the apex of a frond 30 cm. long and

the same piece of rock, some of them agreeing with the specimen 
shown in Fig. 2. These pinnae (Fig. 3) are fairly broad, and 
in some of those nearer the lower pai't of the frond the upper 
edge of the base is slightly lobed or 'eared.' The apices are 
acuminate, the lower edge of the pinnae being more strongly 
curved towai'ds the tip than the upper. There is a close 
resemblance between the apex of the frond, as shown in the 
figure, and that of Otozamites fframt'neus, Phill.,'* but in Phillips' 
8i)ocimen (now in the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge, No. 216) 
the pinnae are of the Otozamites type. Several other fronds occur

Genus ANOMOZAMITES, Schimper. 
[Trait, pal. veg. vol. ii. p. 140, 1870.] 

The genus Anomozamites may be thus defined : — 
Frond comparatively small, linear, or tongue - shaped, usually 
divided into segments which present a more or less obvious 
difference in breadth, separate or confluent at the base, attached 
laterally to the rachis, and never entirely covering the upper face 
of the frond axis ; the segments bluntly rounded or truncate 
distally; veins simple and parallel, generally at right angles ta 
the rachis. 



1 Seward (95), pi. x. fig. 4. 



ANOMOZAMITES. 203 

The differences between this genus and Pterophylluyn and 
NiUsonia were discussed in the second volume of the Wealden 
Flora, and need not he considered here. 

There is, however, one point of importance as regards the 
probable systematic position of Anomozamites. Nathorst has given 
a description of some specimens which afford trustworthy evidence 
of the association of a Williamsonia type of flower with Anomo- 
zamites fronds.^ The restoration which he gives of the plant 
indicates a habit different from that of TFilliamsonia gigas ; the 
stem is repeatedly branched dichotomously, and in each fork there 
is a single flower of Williamsonia angustifolia, Nath.,* the fronds 
being of the type Anomozamites minor (Brongn.). The specimens 
on which the restoration is based are in the Palaeobotanical 
Museum, Stockholm ; an examination of them a few years ago 
led me to agree with Professor Jfathorst in his interpretation of 
the habit of the plant. Nathorst's evidence enables us, therefore, 
to include Anomozamites as another member of the Bcnncttiteoe, 
closely allied to Williamsonia gigas in the fonn of the reproductive 
organs, but diff'ering from that type, as also from Williamsonia 
pecten, in the form of the fronds and in the habit of the stem. 

The linear shape of the leaf of Anomozamites and the unequal 
segments suggest a comparison with the fronds of Polypodium 
irioides, Lam. ; it is of some interest to find that more than one 
type of Mesozoic Cycadean frond may be fairly closely matched 
with the leaves of recent ferns. These resemblances, although of 
no very great value in themselves, are of interest as additional 
links connecting the Cycadales and Filices, which it is believed 
represent phyla of the plant kingdom descended from a common 
stock of remote antiquity. 

The resemblance between Anomozamites and Pterophyllum has 
led Potonie^ to unite the two genera, regarding the former as 
a synonym of the latter ; for the present, at least, it is probably 
the better plan to retain both generic terms.

Type-specimen. The type-specimen of Phillips is in the York 
Museum. 

Frond linear or hroadly lanceolate ; the lamina may he almost 
entire or divided into distally truncate segments varying considerably 
in breadth ; the apex is obtuse, and the lamina is usually entire at 
the distal end of the frond. The veins are more or less at right 
angles to the rachis, and are either simple or dichotomously 
branched; the branching may occur close to the rachis or in any 
part of the lamina. 

Phillips' figure, which is somewhat crude, represents the type- 
specimen half the natural size ; the veins are indistinct. Some 
forms of Anomozamites Nilssoni exhibit a fairly close agreement 
with the fronds of Nilssonia compta, but the segments of the 
latter species are usually more oblique to the axis of the frond, and

the veins are very indistinctly shown, as is frequently the case 
in leaves of this species. 

The fronds figured by Nathorst from the Ehsetic of Sweden 
as Anomozamites gracilis^ appear to be very similar to those of 
A. NiUsoni, but they are probably not specifically identical. 

39.306. Text-fig. 36. 

This specimen illustrates the striking inequality in the segments ; 
at the apex the lamina is entire and obtusely pointed ; in the 
middle and basal portions the lamina is broken up into segments 
resembling in shape those of Nilssonia compta, but differing in 
their finer texture as well as in their straighter terminations, 
in the less curved upper edge, and in the venation. The veins 
in this specimen are not shown quite accurately in the figure ; 
if examined closely they are seen to fork fairly often, as in 
TcBniopteris. Labelled by Bean Pterophyllum Nilssoni.

nature of the reproductive organs of Otozamites, but it may be 
safely regarded as a Cycade£in plant bearing a closer resemblance 
to ferns in the form and venation of the pinnules than is the 
■case with the majority of recent species of the Cycadaceae.

Type-specimens. Type of Cyclopteris Beani, L. & H., in the- 
Scarborough Museum ; tj^pe of Otopteris mediana, Leckenby, in 
the "Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge (No. 235). 

Frond pinnate, long, narrow, and of uniform breadth, tapering 
gradually towards the slender apex. Pinnae short and broad, 
varying in shape from broadly oval with bluntly rounded apices to- 
deltoid or suborbicular in the lower part of the frond (PI. I. Fig. 4), 
and narrower, longer, and more lanceolate in the distal portion of 
the frond (PL I. Fig. 3). The pinnae are alternate and in part 
imbricate, attached by the lower part of the auriculate base to 
the upper face of the rachis, which is usually hidden by the 
overlapping auriculate bases of the pinnae. Veins numerous, 
repeatedly forked and spreading from the base. 

The specimen which Leckenby referred to a distinct species^ 
Otopteris mediana (N'o. 235 in the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge), 
is, I believe, specifically identical with 0. Beani, L. & H. In 
a note written on a specimen in the Leckenby Collection Nathorst 
also expresses this opinion. A somewhat similar type of Otozamites^ 
is represented by the "Wealden species, 0. KUpsteini (Dunk.), of 
which the British Museum possesses a fine series.^ 

This is one of the most striking species among the Yorkshire 
plants ; it is usually placed among the Cycads, but in the absence 
of any information as to either stems or flowers we have no 
proof of its Cycadean nature. It is in all probability correctly 
included in the Cycadales ; the form of the leaves recalls that 
of recent Cycads, but there is no living species of which the 
pinna; bear more than a distant resemblance to those of Otozamites 
Beani. It is interesting to find a close agreement between the 
fronds of this fossil form and those of a recent fern, Anemia: 
rotundifolia, Schrad. ; the habit of the leaf, the shape and venation

of the fern, exhibit a greater likeness to Otozamites Beani than 
is presented by any recent Cycad. "While believing this Jiu-assic 
plant to be a member of the Cycadales, I would draw attention 
to the fact that the fronds exhibit more marked fern - like 
characters than are found in recent Cycadean leaves. The 
Palaeozoic Cycadofilices have made us familiar with the union of 
Filicinean and Cycadean features, and traces of the common 
origin of the Ferns and Cycads are exhibited by the Mesozoic 
genus Bennettites. In the frond of Otozamites Beani we have, 
I believe, a further indication among Jurassic Cycadean plants 
of the close relationship of Ferns and Cycads, which is more 
faintly revealed in the recent species of these two groups. 
Among recent Cycadean fronds which bear most resemblance to 
Otozamites Beani may be mentioned Zamia furfuracea, Ait., and 
allied forms.

A large slab of shale with two fronds about 20 cm. long, and

and a breadth of 1*7 cm. The pinnae are attached to the upper 
face of the rachis by the lower edge of the base, the lobed 
upper edge being free and often overlapping the next higher 
pinna ; the veins are well marked, spreading from the point of 
attachment, and frequently forked. The pinna) shown in the 
figure have somewhat more pointed apices than in some of 
the specimens of this species. Cf. Zigno's figui'es * (pis. xxxv.

bases of the segments, as in Otozamites Beani. 

Otozamites Bunburyanus agrees in many respects with 0. Beani, 
but differs in the smaller size and more rounded or orbicular form 
of the pinnae ; the long narrow fronds may be compared with 
those of certain ferns, e.g. JVephrolepis Duffii. Some of the 
Italian specimens referred by Zigno^ to Otozatnites Trevisani may 
be compared with 0. Bunburyanus. The reproductive organs and 
stems are unknown, but in all probability this plant represents 
another example of the combination of Cycadcan and FiHcinean 
characters. 

The frond figured by Brongniarf^ from a French locality as 
Filicites Demoyersii and afterwards as Pecopteris Desnoyersii^ may 
be compared with Otozamites Bunburyanus, but the two plants 
are probably not specifically identical. 

The Museums of Cambridge (Leckenby Coll.), York, and 
Manchester contain interesting specimens of this species.

The figures represent portions of two fronds. The specimen 
shows several fronds converging towards one point, suggesting 
their preservation in a position similar to that which they occupied 
when attached to the stem. The pinnae, orbicular or suborbicular 
in shape, vary but slightly in size in a length of frond of 1 2 cm. 
The rachis is broad, and bears the pinnae obliquely attached to- 
its upper face ; in some places the pinnae are distinctly imbricate, 
in others separate. The veins are clearly shown spreading from 
the base and occasionally forked. The fronds vaiy in breadth, 
from "6 to '9 cm.

Type-specimen. Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 215). 

Prond pinnate ; pinnae more or less falcate, attached alternately 
to the upper surface of the rachis, characterized by the strongly 
auriculate upper edge of the base; veins spreading in the basal 
portion of the segments and slightly oblique to the upper edge of 
the rest of the lamina ; apices acuminate and directed upwards. 

The species Otopteris graphica is mentioned by Bronn^ in 1848 
and by Mon-is* in 1854, but these authors refer to the specific 
name instituted by Bean in manuscript, without publication ; 
the first description and illustration of the species under Bean's 
name is in Leckenby's paper of 1864. The fragment figured by 
Brongniart as Filicites Bucklandi, var. gallica, from Mamers, of 
Buthonian age, is probably specifically identical with the more 
perfect frond figured by Leckenby ; this view is adopted by 
Saporta and Schimper. Considering the fragmentary nature of 
Brongniart's specimen it is safer to regard Leckenby's specimen 
as the type of the species and to retain the name originally 
pjoposed by Bean. 

Some of the Rhaetic fronds figured by Schenk as Otopteris 
Sucklandi^ very closely resemble Otozamites graphicus, and afford 
connecting links between that species and 0. ohtusus.

214 OTOZAMITES, 

A specimen in the Scarborough Museum, which is no doubt 
identical with this species, has been named by Richards ^ 
Otozamites PJiillipsii, but no description of the species has been 
published. Good examples are contained in the collections at 
Whitby and Cambridge. Specimens of Otozamites graphicm are 
occasionally met with labelled 0. acummatus, but the falcate form 
of the pinnae and their more regular oblique attachment to the 
rachis afford distinguishing features.

Frond pinnate, of similar fonn to that of Williamsonia gigas, 
from which it differs in the more gradually tapered and acuminate 
pinnse, and in the wider angle at which the segments ai'e attached 
to the rachis. The apical pinno) ai-e narrow, linear in fonn, while 
the basal pinnae are shorter and broader, and more or less ovate, 
with an acuminate apex, attached to the rachis at a slightly obtuse 
angle. 

It is convenient to designate certain forms of this species in 
which the pinnae are short and tapering distally to an acuminate 
apex (e.g. PI. II. Fig. 1) 0. acuminatus, var. hrevifolius, and 
others with broader pinnae 0. acuminatus, var. latifoUus. The 
former name, var. hrevifolius, was used by Lindley & Hutton for

fronds witli shorter pinnae ; the latter term was adopted by 
Phillips as a specific name. The type-specimen of Phillips' species 
is in the York Museum, and consists of an imperfectly preserved 
portion of a frond which cannot be satisfactorily defined as 
a species distinct from 0. acuminatus, but is, I believe, identical 
with this species. The drawing given by Phillips is by no means 
accurate ; the veins in the pinnae are numerous, and not as 
represented in the figure. 

This species bears a close resemblance to Otozamites Beani, and 
the two types of frond may be almost connected by transitional 
forms; the longer and narrower acuminate pinnae of Otozamites 
acuminatus afford the most convenient distinguishing feature. 
Some fronds of WilUamsonia gigas also present a strong likeness 
to those of Otozamites acuminatus ; their resemblance aifords one 
of several instances illustrating the difficulty of drawing any 
satisfactory distinction between the Zamites and Otozamites type 
of pinnae. In Otozamites acuminatus the lower pinnae are shorter 
and broader than in WilUamsonia gigas, and are frequently 
attached to the basal portion of the rachis at a slightly obtuse 
angle. Good specimens of the species occur in the Museums 
of Scarborough, Whitby, and JS'ewcastle, also in the Museum of 
Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, London, and in other collections.

figure, are rounded at the corners and are hardly typical of 
Otozamites, but some of the smaller pinnae of this species are 
more definitely lobed and conform more nearly with the recognized 
character of the genus. Cf. Zamites Moreaui, Sap.^

Frond pinnate ; pinnae short and comparatively broad, attached 
to the upper face of the rachis at a wide angle, the base is 
slightly auriculate at the upper edge ; veins somewhat spreading 
at the base, but approximately parallel to the edge of the lamina 
through the greater part of their course ; apex of the pinnae obtuse. 

This species was defined by Phillips as follows : — "Frond vciy 
long, narrow, composed of many oval, slightly obtuse leaves, two 
or three times as long as broad, set perpendicular to the rachis ; 
venation radiating from the proximal paii; of the base of the leaf, 
furcate, and dividing to about forty venules towards the edge." 

I have adopted Phillips' specific name for a few specimens of 
Otozamites fi'onds represented in several English collections, which 
-agree very closely with some of the fronds figured by Zigno from 
Italy, and also closely resemble in the form of their pinnae the

type shown in woodcut 47 of tlic Geology of Yorhshire. It is 
questionable whether the wiser plan would be to make use of one 
of Zigno's specific names, but as I feel practically no doubt as to 
the specific identity of the specimens referred to 0. parallelus and 
the type-specimen of Phillips' species, I have revived the name 
instituted by this author. Some of the smaller forms of Zigno's 
species Otozamites Molinianus ' are, to some extent, intermediate in 
form between 0. parallelus and 0. Feistmanteli. 

Otozamites parallelus may be compared also with a similar bvit 
probably not identical species, Nils&onia pterophylloides, described 
by Yokoyama from Japan.'^ 

This type of frond is represented by a single specimen in the 
National Collection. The best examples are in the Leckenby 
Collection, Cambridge (Nos. 218, 219), and in the Scarborough 
Museum.

Type-specimen. The original of pi. cxxviii. of the Fossil Flora 
is in the Oxford Mnscum. 

The Inferior Oolite form differs slightly from the type -specimen 
of Otozamites ohtusus (L. & H.)* in the pinnaj ha\dng slightly 
more acuminate apices, and in the lower margin of the pinnae being 
somewhat less abruptly curved upwaixls. (Cf. the drawing given 
by Lindley & Hutton, and PL I. Fig. 1 and PI. II. Fig. 2 of this 
Catalogue.) 

The fonn of Cycadean frond represented by the type-specimen of 
Otozamites ohtusus from the Lias near Axminster, and now in the 
Oxford Museum, is one which is widely spread in Ithajtic, Liassic, 
and Oolitic strata. There are several fronds described from these 
horizons by various authors under different specific names, which 
it is practically impossible to separate from one another by any 
really distinctive features of taxonomic value. To avoid the 
danger of artificial distinction, suggested bj- the application of 
specific names to fronds which agi-ee with one another in their 
general fonn, but differ in slight variations in the form of the 
pinnae, apices, and other incon.stant and unimportant characters, 
I propose to use the designation Otozamites obtusus in a wide sense, 
as denoting a type of frond represented by examples hitherto 
considered as distinct species. The verj' strong likeness between 
the ' species ' which centre round Otozamites obtusus is well illus- 
trated by the lists of synonyms given by different authors. There 
is a want of unanimity in the interpretation of the extremely 
slight differences which may be detected in comparing the fronds 
from Ehaetic, Liassic, and Oolitic horizons, demonstrating the 
absence of any satisfactory distinctive features worthy of specific 
distinction. The differences between young and old fronds of 



' There are several good examples of the Lias form, identical with the type- 
specimen of Lindley ic Hutton, in the British Museum; e.g., Nos. 39,059, 
40,692, 47,045, etc. 



220 OTOZAMITES, 

one and the same plant are, indeed, greater than between some of 
the so-called species of this typo of frond. It is wiser to admit 
that we cannot hope to accurately separate species by such fine 
distinctions as have been discovered in the form of the pinnse of 
fronds from different localities. A slight difference in geological 
age is often responsible for the undue importance attached to 
almost imperceptible distinctions, which are raised to the rank of 
specific characters. 

In the list of synonyms I have included such forms as agree most 
nearly with Otozamites oMusus, L. & H. ; it is not meant to imply 
that the several ' species ' are identical, but that they are all 
characterized by the possession of fronds conforming in the main 
to one type ; such small differences as may be recognized are not 
considered sufficient to warrant their use as specific characters. It 
may be convenient to retain some, at least, of the specific names as 
varietal or * form ' designations. The Inferior Oolite fronds which 
Phillips spoke of as Otozamites oitusus ^ may be spoken of as 
Otozamites ohtusus (L. & H.), var. ooliticus, in order to draw 
a distinction between the Inferior Oolite fronds and the closely 
allied, but not absolutely identical, type of Liassic age. 

There are some very good examples of this type of Otozamites 
in the York Museum, one of which, labelled by Bean Otopteris 
graphica, has a length of 17 cm. The pinnse have pointed apices, 
and the upper edge of the base is distinctly auriculate. 

39,201. PI. I. Fig. 1. 

This frond, of which a few pinnae are represented in the 
■drawing, measures 40 cm. in length, and is one of the most 
beautiful examples of a fossil Cycadean leaf in the Museum 
Collection. The portion figured is a little above the middle of 
the whole frond. The pinnae vary very slightly in size (about 
5 cm. long and 1 cm. broad) throughout the length of the frond ; 
ihey are obliquely attached to the upper face of the rachis, and 
the upper edge of the base is prominently eared. The apices 
^rc obtusely pointed ; the upper edge of the lower pinnae is 
somewhat more falcate than in those shown in Pig. 1, but the 
more strongly curved and sharply pointed pinnae of Otozamites

corner is slightly auriculate ; the apex is bluntly rounded, the 
tip being directed upwai'ds. Yenation of the Otozamites type. 

In tlie Museums of York and Leeds there are a few fairly 
large and well-preserved fronds which I regard as specifically 
identical mth certain Italian specimens named by Zigno Otozamites 
Feistmanteli ; they are characterized by their long and naiTow form, 
comparable to 0. Bimhuryanus, and short and broad pinnae. The' 
pinnae differ from those of the latter species in being longer and 
less orbicular in shape; but some fronds referred by Zigno to 
Otozamites Trevisani^ furnish an example of a form more or less 
intennediate between 0. Feistmanteli and 0. Bunburyanus. It 
is not improbable that another Italian frond named by Zigno 

1 Zigno (81), pi. xxxvii. figs. 7 and 8. 



222 OTOZAMITES. 

0. Massalongianus ^ is specifically identical with 0, Feistmanteli, 
hilt the latter name has heen adopted on account of the more 
striking agreement of the specimens so named by Zigno with the 
English examples. 

Some of the smaller fronds of Otozamttes MoUnianus"^ may be 
compared also with 0. Feistmanteli^ as well as with 0. parallelm. 
One or two of the specimens from Italy figured as Otozamites 
veronensis, Zigno, ^ are also very similar to 0. Feistmanteli. 

The Indian Cycadean leaves named by Oldham & Morris 
PalcBOzamia lengalensis * are practically indistinguishable from 
0. Feistmanteli. 

The frond described by Kurr from a German locality as Zamites 
Mandelslohi^ is closely allied to, if not identical with, Otozamites 
Feistmanteli. Another example of a similar type of leaf is afi'orded 
by 0. Reglei as figured by Saporta.® These two species are com- 
pared by Lignier with a similar type of Otozamites {0. crassifoUus), 
which he has described from a Lias locality in Normandy.'' 

The York specimen of Otozamites Feistmanteli has a length 
of 22 cm.; the pinnae vaiy in length from 8 mm. to 1-4 cm., 
having an average breadth of 6 mm. The example in the Leeds 
Museum represents a smaller frond, bearing pinnae about 8 mm. long. 

V. 3683. This is the only specimen in the British Museum 
which appears to be identical with Zigno's species ; it is 6 cm. long 
and 1 cm. in breadth, bearing short, broad, and closely set pinnae.

Frond broadly linear, varying considerably in size and in the 
depth and number of the segments. The lamina is dissected up to 
the central midrib or rachis into truncate segments of unequal 
breadth, traversed by several parallel veins both simple and 
forked ; the lamina is continuous over the rachis of the fi'ond, and 
the segments are not laterally attached as in Pterophyllum. 

Brongniart includes in his Prodrome, under the name Pterophyllum 
Willtamsoms, a species from the Lower Oolite in the list of examples 
of Pterophyllum, but in the Tableau this name occurs as a synonym 
of Nilssonia compta. Phillips' figirre of this species in the Geology 
of the Yorkshire Coast represents a portion of a frond one-half 
natural size. An earlier drawing given by Young & Bird of 
a specimen which is now in the Whitby Museum (No. 2381) 
illustrates somewhat crudely the characteristic features of the same 
type of leaf. 

Nilssonia compta is one of the most abundant species in the 
Inferior Oolite flora, and is usually represented by several 
specimens in museum collections. Without attempting a com- 
parative account of the various fossils of Mesozoic age which agree 
more or less closely with Phillips' species, attention may be drawn 
to the large leaves figured by Fontaine from the Potomac plant- 
beds under the name Platypterigium densinerve} An examination) 
of a few specimens of this species in the Washington Geological 
Museum led me to regard the plant as probably a Nilssonia. 

The large and broad fronds from the Eajmahal Hills of India, 
figured by Oldham & Morris ^ and by Feistmantel ^ as Pterophyllum 
princeps, bear a close resemblance to the largest examples of 
Nilssonia compta ; it is not clear from the illustrations if the 
segments of the lamina are laterally attached as in Pterophyllum, 
or if the median portion of the frond is incomplete and presents 
a deceptive resemblance to that genus. In specimens of Nilssonia 
compta one occasionally sees the rachis represented by a fairly

broad shallow groove, which might suggest the lateral attachment 
of the lamina characteristic of Pterophyllum fronds. 

The largest examples I have met with are in the Whitby 
Museum, some of which have a length of over 40 cm. and 
a breadth of 9 cm. (vide Text-fig. 40). A large frond, with 
narrow segments, 31 cm. in length, may be seen in the Scarborough 
Museum. Good specimens are represented also in the Leckenby 
Collection, Cambridge, the Museum of Practical Geology, London, 
and elsewhere. A Scarborough specimen in the Natural History 
Museum, Paris, bears the name Nihsonia Williamsonis, the original 
specific designation proposed by Brongniart.

Nihsonia compta, characteristic of the Inferior Oolite vegetation, 
appears to be practically identical with some, at least, of the 
fronds of Rhajtic age described by Schenk,* Nathorst,- and) others 
as N. polymorpha ; this close resemblance affords one of many 
instances of the marked agreement between the Ehaetic and Inferior 
Oolite floras.

Good examples of fronds of medium width. In one of the 
specimens (Fig. a) the manner of attachment and form of the basal 
segments are clearly shown ; they extend to the middle of the 
upper face of the rachis, and are not attached to the edge as in 
Pterophyllum. In Fig. b the basal segments are much shorter 
and smaller than in the example illustrated in Fig. a. These two 
figures afford good examples of the variation in the basal portion 
of fronds of the same species. The longest frond measures 18 cm. 
in length.

Another basal portion of a frond, showing the broad petiole 
and the form of the lowest segments. The segments of this 
frond have very prominent veins as broad ribs, with occasionally 
much finer veins between. The prominence of the ribs is no 
doubt due to the presence of bands of thick-walled hypoderm, 
which with the vascular bundles probably constituted I -shaped 
strengthening girders stretching across the lamina.

Part of an unusually large frond in the Whitby Museum. 
Owing to the imperfect state of preservation of the median 
portion, the segments do not extend so far over the upper face 
of the rachis as in the more perfect specimens. The whole frond 
measures more than 40 cm. in length, and has a breadth of 9 cm.

Type-specimens. The type-specimens of PterophyUum mediamim,. 
Leckenby, ex Bean MS., and of P. angustifolium, Leek., ex Bean 
MS., are in the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (Nos. 278, 275). 

Frond broadly linear ; the lamina is divided into numerous 
linear segments of unequal breadth traversed by several parallel 
veins. This species agrees closely in habit with Nilssonia compta, 
but differs in the narrower leaf - segments and in their more 
acuminate and less tmncate apices. The veins are somewhat less 
prominent in Nilssonia mediana, and the lamina is thinner and 
not so stout as in N. compta. 

The specimen figured by Phillips in 1829 as Cycadites tenuicaulis 
from the middle shale of Gristhorpe is defined as follows in the 
third edition of the Geology of Yorkshire: — "Frond lanceolate, 
ample, with a slender rachis ; leaflets perpendicular to the rachis, 
unequal, ending obtusely, approximate at the base ; venation 
parallel, delicate." ^ 

In 1864 Leckenby described two species of Yorkshire Oolite 
plants under the names PterophyUum medianum and P. angustifolium; 
the type-specimens of these species are, I believe, indistinguishable 
specifically from the plant named by Phillips Cycadites tenuicaulis.

named by Leckenby Pterophyllum angustifoUum, and the specimen 
is so labelled by Sean ; a compaiison of several specimens in the 
Leckenby and British Museum Collections leads me to unhesitatingly 
regard this fomi of fi'ond as specifically indistinguishable from 
Ifihsonia mediana.

1. Ctenis falcata, Lindley & Hutton, 

2. Ctenis, sp. 

In 1829 Phillips described a plant from the Oolitic rocks of 
the Yorkshire coast under the name Cycadites sulcicaulis,^ and 
in 1834 Lindley & Hutton'' substituted the name Ctenis falcata, 
altering the generic designation on the ground that the venation 
did not agree with that of Cycadites. The authoi-s of the Fossil 
Flora compared this plant with a species of Acrostichum and 
with Palms, but considered that it should be included among 
the Cycadaceae. They proposed to apply the generic name Ctenis 
to " aU leaves ha^•ing the genei'al character of Cycadeoe, but with 
the veins connected by forks or transverse bars." 

There has been considerable difference of opinion among 
palseobotanical writei's as to the position of Ctenis in the plant 
kingdom ; some authors — Sternberg, Brongniaii:, Schimper, and 
othei's — ^have regarded it as a Cycad, while by many others it 
has been included among the Ferns. "Without giving the history 
of the views expressed as to the botanical position of Ctenis, we 
may briefly consider the evidence on which the genus has been 
refen'ed to the Ferns rather than to the Cycads. 

In 1868 Schenk' discovered certain chai-acters in a specimen of 
Ettingshausen's species Tceniopteris asplenioides, which led him to 
substitute the generic designation Ctoiis. The veins of the broad 
linear segments of the pinnate frond were found to agree in their

of the segments was found to he covered with small circular

of the specimen did not permit of any microscopical examination of

the epidermal cells or ' sporangia.' Additional evidence beaiing 
on the systematic position of Ctenis has been furnished in recent 



CTENIS. 233 

3'('ars by Raciborski and Staub. The former author, in his Fossil 
Flora of the Cracow District, describes several species of Ctenis,^ 
some of which exhibit circular projections on the surface of the 
se<>;inents similar to those noticed by Schenk. The epidermal cells 
of the segments bear several circular projections which Raciborski 
regards as sori or sporangia, and accepts as evidence of a Filicinean 
affinity ; he was, however, unable to recognize any actual sporangial 
structure. In a recent paper by Staub ^ on species of Ctenis, an 
unusually large fi'ond of Liassic age, reaching a length of 2 metres, 
is described under the name Ctenis hungarica ; on the segments 
of this frond were found small depressions which the author of the 
species speaks of as son. "We see, then, that the inclusion of 
Ctenis among the ferns rests on inconclusive evidence, and no proof 
has been adduced that the circular elevations or depressions on 
the epidermal cells are of the natui'e of sori or spoi'angia. 

In his Fhran vid ^'m/ Nathorst ^ described some long and broad 
leaves with reticulate venation, which he referred to a new genus, 
Aiithrophyopsis, on account of their resemblance to the simple 
fronds of the polypotliaceous fern Anthrophyum. In 1879 Xathoret 
transferred these Ithaitic specimens to the genus Ctenis, the supposed 
leaves being recognized as detached and fi'agmentary segments of 
a pinnate frond. Some of the figiu'es of the Scanian fossils show 
circular elevations on the epidermis like those already refeiTed to. 
My own observations lead me to regaixl the evidence hitherto relied 
•on in favour of placing Ctenis among the ferns as insufficient, and 
I believe the general habit of the leaves is a strong argument 
for including the species of this genus among the Cycadales. 
A specimen in the Manchester Museum fi'om the Yorkshire coast 
rocks was described by Nathorst* in 1880 as probably a new species 
of Anthrophyopsis ; a recent examination of this specimen has 
iitfoi-ded important information as to the nature of the supposed 
sori described by Raciborski, Schenk, Nathorst, and Staub. The 
specimen (Text-fig. 42) consists of a portion of a pinna 9 cm. in 
length and 2'6 cm. broad, traversed by short parallel veins which are 
connected here and there by oblique transverse veins ; the epidermal

cells, which are well preserved, and readily examined under the 
microscope after suitable treatment, are characterized by prominent 
circular papillae agreeing precisely with those figured as sori by 
Raciborski and other authors. It is not uncommon among recent 
plants to find the surface cells of a leaf provided with conical 
elevations or papillae ; the circular elevations on the epidermal cells 
of Ctenis (Text-fig. 43, A p and B) are identical with those met 
with in recent plants. The enlarged drawing (Text-fig. 43) demon- 
strates the nature of these sorus-like projections as seen in the 
Ctenis segments in the Manchester Museum. The three epidermal

the circular dots seen in surface-view in Fig. 43, p; the shaded

In view of these facts, I prefer to retain Ctenis as a Cycadean 
genus characterized by pinnate fronds with linear segments 
traversed by parallel veins connected at intervals hy lateral 
anastomoses.

Frond pinnate ; the linear pinnse are attached ohliquely or

their attachment they resemhle those of the genus PterophyUum ; 
the long pinnse or segments, which reach a length of more than 
10 cm., taper gradually towards an acuminate apex, which is 
seldom preserved ; they are traversed by several parallel veins, 
connected by frequent lateral anastomoses, which diverge slightly 
in the broader basal region of the pinnai (PI. VIII. Fig. 2). At 
the base of each pinna the lamina becomes broader, the upper 
margin is bent slightly upwards on the rachis, and the lower

of the segrQcnt with the stoxit veins and lateral connections is 
shown in Text-fig. 42. The epidermal papillae (Text-fig. 43) have 
already been described in the remarks on the genus Ctem's. Sa 
far as it is possible to base any comparison on the single specimen 
of this type of Ctenis, which is not represented in the British^ 
Museum, the frond probably agreed fairly closely with that of 
Gtenie fallax, Nath., from the Ehsetic of Scania ; it differs from 
Ctenis falcata in the greater breadth and coarser venation of the- 
pinna?. 



Genus PTILOZAMITES, Nathorst. 
[Flor. Hiiganas och Helsingborg, p. 21, 1878.] 

The genus Ptilotamites was instituted by Nathorst in 1878, 
and defined as follows: — "Folia petiolata lincaria, regulariter 
pinnata, pinnis tota latitudinc basis insertis, margine anterioro 
recta vcl paulum concava, posteriore rotundata, nerA-is dichotomis 
radiantibus prcesertim versus marginem posteriorcm. Differt 
a Ptilophyllo margine anteriore pinnarum non subauriculata ab 
Anomozamite a quo nonnuUa) species vix distinguendaj nervis 
radiantibus non parallelis." ' 

At a later date this author proposed the generic name Ctenozamites 
for fronds of the Ptiloza mites type which are bipinnate and not 
simply pinnate in their habit ; this genus has been employed by 
Schenk in his description of a bipinnate frond — Ctenozamites cycadea 
— from Persia.'' 

"We may make use of the more recent designation as a subgenus 
of Ftilozamites, and apply it to bipinnate fronds such as Ctenis 
ZecJcenbyi, Bean MS. The data we at present possess is insufficient 
to enable us to decide with certainty the botanical affinity of 
Ptilozamites, but the probability is that the fronds, having the 
characters of Nathorst's genus, may be best compared with the 
recent Cycad, Bowenia spectabtlis, Hook.

Type -specimen. Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge (Leckenby 
Coll., Fo. 245). 

Frond bipinnate ; racbis stout, giving off pinnae at an acute 
angle; the pinnae have slender axes bearing falcate segments 
attached by the whole of the broad base, the apices are obtusely 
pointed and directed upwards, in the distal portion the margin may 
be finely denticulate ; several veins enter the base of each segment 
and diverge slightly, and they branch dichotomously once or more 
as they pass to the distal edge of the segment, which is formed of 
the strongly bent posterior margin. 

This species does not appear to be represented by any specimens 
in the British Museum Collection of Yorkshire plants ; the only 
examples I have met with are those in the Leckenby Collection, 
Cambridge, the best of which was figured in 1864 under Bean's 
manuscript name, Ctenis Leckenbyi. 

I am indebted to Professor Nathorst for calling my attention to 
a specimen in the Stockholm Museum in which the margin of the 
segments is finely denticulate towards the apex. 

The species which present the closest agreement with Ptilozamites 
{Ctenozamites) Lechenhyi are those described by Nathorst from 
Scania,^ and the still finer examples figured by Schenk'^ from 
Persia. A specimen in the British Museum (No. 40,674) from 
the Liassic beds of the south-west of England bears a strong 
resemblance to Leckenby's Inferior Oolite species.

referred to Ctenozamites.- 



Genus DIOONITES, Miquel. 

[Tijdsch. Wis. Nat. Wet. vol. iv. p. 205, 1851.] 

The solitary specimen which I have referred to this genus 
does not afford entirely satisfactory evidence as to the precise 
manner of attachment of the pinnae to the rachis, but it is 
probably better to adopt the designation Dioom'tes than any other 
generic name. I have elsewhere given a comprehensive diagnosis 
of this genus.^ 

Dioouites Nathorsti, sp. nov. 

Type-specimen. "Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge (Leckenby 
€oll., No. 222). 

Frond pinnate ; the pinnae are given off from a fairly stout rachis 
at an acute angle. The pinnae are narrow and linear, 3-4 mm. 
wide, and reaching a length of 8 cm. ; they are attached by the 
whole of the base, which is slightly wider than the rest of the 
pinnae ; the pinnaB are tapered gradually to an acuminate apex, 
and are traversed by about eight parallel veins. 

On the back of the type-specimen Nathorst has written: "This 
is a new species, belonging to some genus allied to Pterophyllum,''^ 
In the best specimen, which is probably seen from the upper 
side, the rachis has a length of 14*5 cm. ; the pinnae appear to be 
attached laterally, but this is, I believe, due to the exposure 
of the dorsal surface of the frond. The frond must have reached 
a considerable length, and the breadth, which is fairly uniform 
in the portion preserved, measm-es approximately 15-16 cm.

240 . PODOZAMITES. 

In all probability tbe Leckenby specimen represents a new- 
species ; I have chosen the specific name Natliorsti after my friend 
Professor Nathorst, of Stockholm, whose work has materially 
aided me in the identification of the Yorkshire plants. 

Dr. Richards, who printed a list of British Cycadean leaves in 
1884,^ refers this specimen to an Indian species, Ptcrophyllum 
dtstans, Oldham & Morris, and adopts the generic name Dioonitea. 
The frond so named by Moms from the Rajmahal Hills is repre- 
sented by imperfect fragments, which bear a close resemblance to 
the Yorkshire specimen, but the evidence is not, I believe, sufficient 
to justify us in making use of his specific designation. 

Among other Cycadean fronds from Indian localities which are- 
very similar to Dioonites Natliorsti, may be mentioned Zamites 
proximus, Feistmantel,^ Cycadites Blanfordianus, Oldham & Morris,^ 
Pterophyllum Footeanum, Feistmantel.* Another species similar 
to Bioonites Natliorsti is that described by Jaeger as Osmundites 
pectinatus ^ ( = Pterophyllum Jaegeri, Brongn.). The Rhaetic 
species, Pterophyllum Braunianum, Gopp.,® and P. carnallianum, 
Gopp.,'' may also be compared with the English type. 

The frond figured by Hosius & Yon Marck ® as Bioonites- 
dbietinus, Miq., bears a resemblance to B. Natliorsti.

distans, Presl, and Z. lanceolatus, L. & H. The following is his 
definition of the genus : — 

"Leaves pinnate; segments distant, alternate, contracted towards 
the base. Veins divergent at the base of the segments, approxi- 
mately parallel in the median and apical portions." 

The definition of Podozamites, which has been somewhat modified 
by later writers, may be stated as follows : — 

Frond (or shoot?) pinnate, the slender axis bears segments, 
usually somewhat far apart and at unequal distances, which vaiy 
considerably in both size and shape, fi'om narrow linear and 
acuminate to broadly oval and obtusely pointed segments ; the 
segments are constricted basally, and traversed by numerous veins 
divergent at the base and approximately parallel to the edges of 
the narrower segments, but convergent in the distal portions of 
the broader segments. The base of the petiole may be enclosed by 
broad acuminate imbricating scale-leaves. 

It has been the custom to include this widely-spread genus in 
the Cycadacese, but it is worthy of note that the resemblance which 
the fi'onds possess to a shoot of Agathis australis, Salisb., a New 
Zealand Conifer, renders it by no means impossible that its true 
position is among the Coniferaj. Such specimens as we possess do 
not enable us to determine the precise manner of attachment of 
the segments, but there are indications of a spiral phyllotaxis 
which would afEord a strong argument in favour of the relationship 
of Podozamites to the Coniferse. Among recent Gycads, there are 
species of Zamia, Ceratozamia, Macrozamia, and Unceplialartos, 
which closely resemble Podozamites lanceolatus, but in the Cycadean 
fi'onds the segments are more regularly disposed than in most of 
the examples of the fossil species. Schenk prefers the generic 
name Zamites to Podozamites ; this author has figured a specimen 
which bears scale-leaves at the base of the petiole,' suggesting an 
origin from a lateral bud such as is occasionally produced by recent 
plants of the genus Cycas ; ' the scales, as Schenk points out, may 
be compared also with the bud-scales of Agathis. 

Another example of Podozamites (P. lanceolatus minor ') is figured

by Nathorst from the Rhsetic beds of Bjuf, in whicli the lower 
part of the petiole is clasped by a few imbricate bracts bearing 
a striking resemblance to bud-scales. 

The structure of the epidermis of the pinnae is described by 
Schenk, and regarded by him as an argument against an alliance 
with the genus Agathis ; the form of the epidermal cells, how- 
ever, does not, I believe, constitute an important objection to the 
suggestion that Podozamites may represent the shoot of a Conifer 
rather than the pinnate frond of a Cycad. 

In addition to the type represented by Podozamites lanceolatus, 
there are others characterized by broadly oval segments, ' 
which suggest a comparison with the broad leaves of Agathis 
Dammara, Rich. 

It is unsatisfactory to express a definite opinion in favour of 
assigning Podozamites to the Coniferae rather than to the Cycadaceae 
on such evidence as is before us, but I am disposed to favour the 
view that the plants, which it has been customary to refer to 
Braun's genus, may be more correctly compared with the Conifer 
Agathis than with any recent Cycad.

Type-specinien of Lindlcy & Hutton in the Manchester Museum, 
Owens College (N"©. 321). 

Frond pinnate ; rachis slender, giving off at unequal intervals 
linear lanceolate segments ; the segments are characterized by their 
gradually tapered acuminate apices and constricted bases ; they are 
traversed by several pai-allel veins. 

The type-specimen was obtained by Williamson from Haibum 
Wyke, and presented with a di*awing and brief description to 
Lindley ; it is described by the former as "no doubt produced by 
some one of the Cycadeoideous stems of the Oolitic rocks." The 
rachis is 13 cm. in length, beaiing in-egularly disposed linear 
pinnae, about 7 mm. broad, attached by a naiTow base. The longest 
pinna measures 7 cm. ia length, and tapers gradually to an 
acuminate apex, but becomes suddenly nan-ow towards the basal 
end ; a few of the pinnae appear to be laterally attached to the 
rachis, with a slightly decurrent lower margin, but in one or two of 



244 PODOZAMITES. 

the. pinnae the attaelimcnt appears to be rather on the upper fact' 
of the rachis. The veins are numerous and parallel, as in the 
Cycadcan genus Zamites. The specimen is not sufficiently well 
preser\"ed to enable us to determine the exact manner of attachment 
of the piimae, and it is veiy doubtful if all of them arc shown in 
their original position. It is probable that the pinnae of this species, 
were deciduous and separated from the rachis by a definite 
separation-surface, and this circumstance adds to the danger of 
assuming that all the leaflets are in their original positions.' 

The considerable amount of variation in the size and form of 
the segments has given rise to the institution, by Heer and other 
authors, of several varietal terms, but it is improbable that the 
numerous so-called varieties were borne by distinct plants. It 
would seem that the species is characterized by a marked tendency 
to variation in the form and dimensions of the linear-lanceolate 
segments. A specimen in the York Museum, which cannot 
reasonably be separated specifically from the ordinary type such 
as is represented in Text-fig. 44, illustrates this variability. The 
pinnae in the York specimen are approximately 4 mm. in breadth ; 
they are arranged on the shale at unequal distances apart, and 
attached by a narrow base to the slender rachis. 

Among the numerous specimens figured by Heer from Jurassic 
rocks of Siberia and Spitzbergen, there are several which appear 
to be identical with Podozamites lanceolatus (L. & H.), and others 
with broader segments (e.g. P.pulchellus^) which represent anothei- 
specific tj-pe. 

"We find several Rhaetic examples of Podozamites^ referred to- 
such species as P. lanceolatus, P. distans, P. Emmonsi, and others, 
which appear to be almost, if not quite, identical with the type- 
species of Lindley & Hutton ; it is clear that this plant was one 
of the most widely spread elements in both the Rhaetic and Oolite 
floras.

This specimen has a length of 17 '5 cm. from the base to the tip 
of the highest leaflet. The preservation is unfortunately not very

good as regards the manner of attactment and venation of tlie 
leaflets. As shown in the drawing, the pinnae (or leaflets) are 
not regularly disposed on the axis, but occui' at irregular distances, 
thus differing from the more regular aiTangement of pinnae in 
a Cycadean frond. Each ' pinna ' is narrower at the base and 
tapers gradually- to an acuminate tip ; the veins are numerous 
and approximately parallel to the edges of the leaflets. The 
figured specimen hears a close resemblance to the type-specimen 
of Lindley & Hutton (in the Manchester Museum) ; of. also the 
figure given by Schenk in the Flora der Grenzschichten of Zamites

to 39,303.

Class GINKGOALES. 



Family GIXKGOACE^. 

The genus Ginkgo (or Salishuria), the Maidenhair-tree of China 
and Japan, has long been recognized as an isolated member of the 
Coniferae ; but in recent years it has been shown that there are 
good grounds for giving expression to its peculiarities by instituting 
a special division of Gymnosperms for the inclusion of this mono- 
tj-pic genus. 

In a recent number of Die Naturliehen Pflamenfamilien by 
Engler & Frantl, the name Ginkoales is adopted as a class- 
designation, and in this subdivision of the Gymnosperms is included 
the family Ginkgoaceoe, represented by the single living genus 
Ginkgo. The following definition of the Ginkgoacea; is quoted 
fi-om Engler & Prantl :— > 

"Flowers unisexual, dioecious, without perianth. Male flowers 
shortly stalked, long, and of loose or open structure. Stamens 
with two free pollen -sacs. Pollen spherical, producing two 
spennatozoids before fertilization. Female flowers supported on 
a long axis bearing usually two terminal carpels, and rarely more 
than two ; these are stalked spherical bodies, the seed being 
sxirrounded at the base by an enveloping collar-like structure. 
Ovules with one integument. The ripe seeds have a fleshy outer 
coat and a hard, strong, inner coat. Embryo with two cotyledons. 
Leaves stalked ; the lamina divided into two or more lobes." 

The most important advance made in recent years as regards our 
knowledge of the morphology and natural position of Ginkgo is the 
discovery by the Japanese botanist Hirase ' of large ciliated and 
spirally coiled spermatozoids, which are produced in the pollen-tube 
shortly before fertilization. Among Conifers the male generative

248 GINKGOACE^E. 

cells, so far as we know at present, are always non-motile ; but, 
on the other hand, spcrmatozoids similar to those of Ginhgo have 
recently been discovered in two genera of Cycads, Cycas^ and 
Zamicb? The fertilization of the egg-cell by means of spcrmatozoids 
aflPords an important distinction between the Ginkgoales and 
Coniferse, and serves as another connecting link between Ginhgo 
and the Cycads. There are several features, as regards both 
vegetative and reproductive characters, in which Ginkgo shows 
a distinct approach to the recent Cycads ; and the Cycadaceae are 
linked to the Ferns by several Palaeozoic genera of plants, which 
it is now customary to include in the class Cycadofllices. In 
the Grinkgoacese, then, we have a family connected by several 
characters with the Cycadaceae, and, like the Cycads, exhibiting 
certain points of contact with the Ferns. 

Ginkgo is the sole surviving representative of the Ginkgoales, 
but there is good reason for including in the same class certain fossil 
genera characteristic of the Mesozoic epoch. In the first place 
we have several fossil species usually referred to Ginkgo itself ; 
the genus Baiera is another closely allied type which should be 
placed in the same family, and I believe we may reasonably 
include in the Ginkgoaceae the type of female flower to which 
Carruthers gave the name Beania? There are several other 
genera which are often refen-ed to the same family with Ginkgo, 
both of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic age, but these need not be 
discussed here. The only other genus, represented in the Inferior 
Oolite strata of East Yorkshire, which need be considered as a 
possible claimant for membership of the Ginkgoaceae is Heer's 
Czekanowskia, in which is now included the plant named by 
Lindley & Hutton Sohnites Murrayana ; for reasons stated else- 
where I have considered Czekanowskia as a Conifer of which the 
precise position is a matter of uncertainty. The evidence on which 
a close relationship of Heer's genus with Ginkgo has frequently 
been assumed to exist, is not strong enough to justify any 
statement which would imply more than a possibility of the two 
genera belonging to the same family.

1. Ginkgo digitata (Brongniart). 

2. Ginkgo whitbiensis, Natliorst. 

The maidenhair - tree was first described under the name 
Ginkgo by Kajmpfer in 1712;* this author published a drawing 
of a shoot and ovule, and spoke of the plant as Ginkgo or Ginan, 
vulgo Itsjo : "arbor nucifera folio adiantino." Linnaeus adopted 
Ka3mpfer'8 designation, and referred to the plant as Ginkgo biloha. 
In 1797 Smith '^ placed this species among the Conifers; he 
proposed the generic name Salishuria and a new specific designation 
adiantifolia in place of the "uncouth name Gingko and the 
incorrect specific term biloba.^^ Since 1797 the names Ginkgo 
biloba and Salisburia adiantifolia have both remained in common 
use. Among the numerous references to Gingko in the literature 
of the present century we find several records of the development 
■of both male and female flowers in trees gi'own at Montpelier, 
A^ienna, Kew, and elsewhere. By Richard, EniUicher, and several 
other authors, Ginkgo has been placed in the family Taxineae ; 
but Eichler, in an important contribution to Martins' Flora 
BrasiUensis, proposed to include the genus in a separate tribe, the 
Salisburyeae.' In 1840 Zuccarini* called attention to the resem- 
blance of the young leaves of Ginkgo to those of the African 
Cycad Encephalartoa horridus, and instituted a comparison between 
the short shoots of the maidenhair - tree and the main stem of 
Cycads. During the past few decades new facts have gradually 
been brought to light demonstrating other and more important 
resemblances between Ginkgo and the Cycads, and finally the 
<liscovery of motile spermatozoids in both Cycads and Ginkgo

afforded sufficient reason for the institution of a separate 
subdivision of the Gymnospcnns in which to include Ksempfer's 
genus. 

Ginkgo is sometimes spoken of as unknown in a wild condition, 
but this statement has recently been challenged by Mrs. Bishop' 
(Miss Bird), who speaks of having "met with several fine 
specimens in the magnificent forests which surround the sources of 
the Gold Eiver and the smaller Min in "Western China." ^ 

The genus Ginkgo, as represented by the single living species 
Ginkgo hiloha, may be diagnosed as follows : — 

A tree of pyramidal form reaching a height of over 30 metres, 
with smooth grey bark, characterized among existing Gymnospenus 
by its flat, broad leaves, with the Cyclopteris tj'pe of venation, 
deciduous in the autumn, possessing a long and slender petiole 
slightly grooved on its upper surface and a lamina varying con- 
siderably in size and shape, occasionally fan-shaped and entire, but 
more frequently divided into two halves by a more or less deep 
median division, or subdivided into several wedge-shaped lobes. 
The foliage-leaves occur either scattered on long shoots or crowded 
at the apex of short shoots ; the latter form of leaf -bearing axis 
often passes by apical growth into the long shoots bearing scattered 
leaves separated by long internodes. 

Flowers dioecious. The male flowers, which occur in the axils 
of scale-leaves, have the form of a stalked central axis bearing 
scattered, loosely disposed stamens ; each stamen consists of a 
slender filament terminating in a very small apical scale, beaiing 
usually two, sometimes three or four, elliptical pollen-sacs which, 
open by longitudinal dehiscence. The pollen - grains develop a 
rudimentary prothallus consisting of a few cells, and before 
fertilization two large spu'ally coiled multiciliate spermatozoids are 
produced from the generative nuclei in the pollen-tube. The 
female flowers usually have the form of a long peduncle bearing 
two terminal elliptical ovules enclosed at the base by a collar-like 
envelope representing a reduced carpellary leaf. Abnormal female 
flowers, possessing more than two ovules, are not infrequently met" 
with. Each ovule consists of a nucellus enclosed by a single 



1 Letter to the London Standard, Aug. 17, 1899. Vide also Bird (80), vol. ii. 
p. 144. 



GINKGO. 251 

integument, which in the ripe seed forms a thick fleshy covering- 
surrounding a hard woody shell ; the nuccllus possesses a well- 
marked pollen-chamber, and in the mature ovule the greater part 
of the nucellar tissue is reduced to a thin papeiy layer enclosing 
a large embryo- sac which usually contains two archcgonia. After 
fertilization, which maj* occur either before or after the ovule has 
fallen from the tree, the egg-cell develops directly into an embryo 
with two cotyledons. 

The secondaiy wood of GinJcgo is composed of tracheids with 
numerous bordered pits on the radial and not uncommonlj' on the 
tangential walls. Resin ducts occur in abundance, both in the pith 
and in the cortical tissues. 

It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed examination of 
the histological characteristics of Ginlcgo ; but we may briefly 
summarize some of the features in which the gemis agi*ees with 
the CycadaceaD. 

1. The archegonia possess two neck-cells. 

2. The seeds are situated at the margin of the carpellar}- leaves, 

and have a fleshy testa. 

3. The male reproductive cells have the foi-m of motile 

spermatozoids. 

4. The short shoots bear scale-leaves and foliage-leaves, and 

present a close resemblance to the stems of Cycads. 

5. The presence of a large pollen-chamber at the apex of. the 

nucellus. 

6. The existence of centripetal wood in the cotyledon-stalk, as 

also in the foliage-leaf, petiole, and elsewhere. 

7. Resemblances in the anatomy of the short shoots to features 

characteristic of Cycadean structure. 

We need not concern ourselves for the present with the various 
views that have been held as to the moi-phology of the female 
flowers, a subject which has given rise to no little controversy, nor 
need we attempt an exhaustive description of the various features 
of morphological and phylogenetic importance exhibited by both 
vegetative and reproductive organs.' 

The leaves of Ginkgo biloha, which Kaempfer and others hava 
compared with those of the maidenhair fern, are of special

252 



importance from the point of view of the geological histoiy of 
the genus. The broad, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lamina, with 
its numerous spreading and dichotomously branched veins, at 
once suggests a comparison with such recent ferns as Adiantum 
reniforme, L., Trichomanes reniforme, Forst., Scolopendrium nigripes, 
Hook., Lindsaya reniformis, Dry., and others. For many years the 
fossil leaves of Ginkgo were regarded by Brongniart and other 
authors as species of ferns, and usually included in the genus 
Cj/dopteris. 

It was Heer who first drew attention to the probable generic 
identity of certain Mesozoic leaves from the Arctic regions and 
Northern European localities with the fern - like leaves of the 
maidenhair-tree.^ The recognition of these fossil leaves as species 
of Ginkgo rather than as ferns was based on the form of the petiole, 
which, Heer pointed out, agrees exactly with that of Ginkgo hiloha, 
but more especially on the discovery of male flowers practically 
identical with those of the recent species, and of seeds and short 
foliage shoots very similar to those of the maidenhair - tree. 
There are but few recent plants possessing leaves which might 
be mistaken for those of Ginkgo ; a few ferns, such as those 
already mentioned, have leaves in form and venation very similar 
to the maidenhair-tree ; but the form of the petiole and the 
frequent association of the reproductive structures with fossil 
leaves, alford confirmatory evidence which enables us to speak with 
certainty as to many of the fossil forms. Among the Angiosperms 
Ginkgo-lUkQ leaves are very rare, and in such a plant as Sakea 
Baxteri, R. Br., the reticulate venation precludes confusion with 
the fem-like leaf of Ginkgo. 

From evidence afforded by fossil leaves and flowers it has been 
possible to draw up a history of the Ginkgoacca^, which demon- 
strates the extreme antiquity and wide geographical distribution of 
Ginkgo and other genera. It is true that some of the leaves 
referred to Ginkgo may be ferns, and on the other hand certain 
so-called fern species might equally well be referred to the 
Ginkgoacese. 

In 1881 Heer' published an interesting paper on the history of 
6^mZ;^o-like trees, in which he summarized the available data.

GIJJKGO. 253- 

concluding that ancestral forms of the i-ecent plant existed as 
far back as the Upper Carboniferous period. Since this paper was 
written many new facts have come to light, which enable us to 
extend the geographical distxibution of the family and strengthen 
Heer's conclusion as to the importance of these Gymnosperaious. 
plants in the Mesozoie or even in the Palaeozoic epoch. 

Such genera as Ginkgoj)hijUum, Saportcea, Trichopitys, Dicrano- 
phyllum, JRhtpidopsis, Wltiitlesei/a, and even Ginkgo itself, have 
been described fi-om Carboniferous and Permian rocks as probable 
members of the family to which Ginhgo biloha belongs. As 
regards some of these genera, there is hardly sufficient evidence 
in favour of their inclusion in the Ginkgoales ; on the other 
hand, the close resemblance of the Permian leaves refen-ed to 
GinkgophijJlum, Ginkgo, Saportaa, and Baiera, to the recent plant, 
render it probable that closely allied species existed in the 
Palaeozoic era. Certain fossil seeds from St. Etienne, of Permian 
age, described by Brongniart ' as species of Cardiocarpus, are 
almost identical in structure with Ginkgo seeds. It is, however, 
from Mesozoie strata that we obtain the most striking proof of 
the abundance of G^/«/.-^o-like trees in the vegetation of the past. 

Although as a rule it is, for various reasons, preferable to 
avoid the application of the name of a recent genus to fossil 
species, yet the generic names Ginkgo and Salisburia have been 
so generally used for fossil leavt's, and on evidence of a trustworthy 
nature, that it would be inadvisable to suggest a departure from 
so well established a custom. The leaves described by Gardner 
from the Tertiary beds between the basaltic lava-flows of Mull, 
and refen-ed to TJnger's species Ginkgo adiantoidi'H,- agree so 
closely with those of the recent species that we may well hesitate 
to admit even a specific difference. When we come to examine 
the Jurassic and Cretaceous species, examples are not lacking 
which also exhibit the closest agreement with the sur\-iving t)ix'. 
It has been pointed out by more than one author that the number- 
of specific names applied to Jurassic Ginkgo leaves is excessive ; 
palseobotanical writers have frequently overlooked the wide range 
of variation exhibited by leaves on the same tree of a living 



» Brongniart (81).

254 GINKGO. 

Gingho. There is a wide difference between the small entire 
leaves borne on fertile shoots and the larger ones with a shallow 
central incision, and between these and the leaves of which 
the lamina is divided into several comparatively narrow lobes 
by divisions extending almost to the petiole. The leaves with 
a large spreading and much dissected lamina are often found 
on young and vigorous shoots or on seedlings ; these might well 
be included in a distinct species if found as isolated fossils.' 

It has been customaiy to make use of Braun's generic name 
Baiera ^ or TJnger's term Jeanpaulia for leaves of a Ginhgo-\i]i.Q habit, 
but having narrower or linear segments of the type represented 
in PI. IX. Figs. 3-7. Such a generic distinction is no doubt, 
in some cases at least, purely artificial, but as it serves a useful 
purpose we may continue the custom, admitting that a distinctive 
generic name does not necessarily imply a distinction of great 
taxonomic importance. It is easy to obtain a series of fossil 
leaves exhibiting various transitional stages between the type, 
in which the lamina is entire, and such a form as that shown 
in Fig. 6, PI. IX., where the lamina is reduced to forked acicular 
segments. The limits of the two genera, Ginkgo and Baiera, 
cannot therefore be accurately defined, but, speaking generally, 
the former name is applied to leaves with an entire lamina, or 
with a lamina divided into two or more comparatively broad 
segments, while the latter name implies leaves in which the 
segments vary in breadth from less than 1 mm. to 2 or 3 mm. 
in breadth, and may be usually described as linear.

Ti/pe-specmens. The type of Brongniart's figures is probably 
in the Paris Museum. The type -specimen named by Phillips 
Sphenopteris latifolia is in the York Museum. 

Leaves with a long slender petiole, slightly expanded at the base 
and grooved on the upper surface, attached to either long or short 
shoots. The lamina may be either entire or repeatedly lobed, 
vaiydng in shape from a broad fan-shaped form, with a straight 
base, or with the lower margin of the lamina making an acute angle- 
with the petiole (e.g. Fig. 1, PL IX.), to a narrower wedge-shaped 
form, in which the lower edges of the lamina make an obtuse angle 
with the petiole (Fig. 10, PI. IX.). Veins numerous, spreading, 
and branched dichotomously. The male flowers are similar in form 
to those of the recent species, the filaments of the anthers bearing 
two or more terminal elliptical or oval pollen-sacs. The female 
flowers are imperfectly known, but probably similar in type to those 
of Ginhgo hiloha. 

In the above diagnosis, which is necessarily incomplete, the- 
flowers are not fully described, because we have no absolute proof 
of the actual connection of certain species of Ginhgo leaves with 
associated male flowers and seeds or fragments of female flowers. 
There is, however, every reason to believe that the flowers of some 
at least of the Mesozoic species of Ginkgo agreed in essentials with 
those of the recent species. 

It will be seen from the above synonymy that I have included 
under Ginhgo digitata certain species which have usually been 
regarded as distinct. The chief reason for this diminution in the 
number of the specific names is to be found in the marked 
tendency to variation in leaf-form of the recent species. The- 
deeply lobed lamina, such as that illustrated in Pigs. 2 and 10, 
PL IX., has generally been regarded as characterizing a separate 
species, named by Sternberg Cyclopteris Huttoni, and referred to by 



GUTKGO. 257 

later authors as Ghikgo Hidtoni ; this fossil form may, however, bo 
closely matched with the more deeply lobed leaves frequently met 
with on the recent species. While including both forms of leaf 
under one specific name, it may be convenient to distinguish the 
more deeply lobed type by adding the term Huttoni as marking 
a ' fonn ' or variety of the species G. digitata. 

Brongniait ' defined the species Cycloptcris digitata as follows : — 
" Cyclopteris foliis pctiolatis, scmiorbiculatis, flabelliformibus, ad 
marginem lobatis, lobis contiguis cuneiformibus truncatis vel 
ad apicem sinuosis, nervis tenuissimis striajformibus sequaUbus." 
Brongniart compares the leaves with those of TricJiomanea reniforme. 

The drawing given in Phillips' work (pi. vii. fig. 18) is far 
from accurate ; it is impossible to detect in the specimen anything 
corresponding to the three small lobes shown at the base of the 
leaf. The type-specimen represents a typical example of a Ginkgo 
leaf with a divided lamina ; it is twice the size of the drawing, 
as indicated in Phillips' figure. Giippcrt, like Brongniart and 
other authors, placed the Ginkgo leaves in a genus denoting 
a fern affinity. Braun included Cyclopteris digitata, Brongn., in 
his new genus Baiera, which he compared with Marsilia, on the 
strength of a supposed resemblance of what he took for reproductive 
structures to the sporocarps of that genus. 

In the fourth volume of his Flora fossilis Arctica, Heer 
discussed the affinity of Cyclopteris digitata, Brongn., and allied 
Jurassic species, which he described fi-om Spitzbergen ; he pointed 
to certain characteristics in the venation of the lamina and to the 
grooved surface of the petiole of the fossil leaves as reasons for 
regarding the leaves as generically identical with those of Ginkgo 
biloba? Heer also described specimens of male flowers and seeds 
associated with several of the fossil leaves, and these he naturally 
regarded, from their very close resemblance to the flowers of the 
recent species, as belonging to the plant which bore the leaves with 
which they were found in close association. 

The species Cyclopteris incisa, described by Eichwald from 
Russia, is of the same fonn as some of the English Ginkgo leaves 
from the Yorkshire coast ; it agrees closely with the example 



• Brongniart (28"), p. 219. 
2 Heer (77'), p. 41. 



258 GINKGO. 

shown in Fig. 1, PI. IX., and still more closely with an unusually 
large leaf of G. digitata in the Manchester Museum.^ Heer's 
species O. integriuscula, from Spitzbergen, is characterized by an 
ontii'e lamina, but, as Nathorst points out and Heer has himself 
admitted, there are no good grounds for regarding this form as 
specifically distinct from G. digitata. In the York Museum there 
is a very good specimen of a GinTcgo leaf from East Yorkshire, 
agreeing in general shape with Fig. 1, PI. IX., but differing in 
having a lamina which is practically entire.'^ 

The Wealden leaves described by Dunker as Cyclopteris digitata, 
and afterwards by Schenk as Baiera multipartita, may possibly 
be specifically identical with the Lower Oolite G. digitata, but 
it is safer to suggest their identity rather than to regard it as 
well established. The wide range of Ginkgo digitata is shown 
by the references in the above list of synonyms ; examples of 
this species have been recorded from Siberia, Spitzbergen, Franz 
Josef Land, Bomholm, England, Persia, Japan, and elsewhere. 
The Arctic distribution of Ginkgo in Upper Jurassic times has 
recently been extended by the discovery of several leaves named 
by Nathorst Ginkgo polaris ^ ; some of them arc very similar to 
G. digitata, and differ only in their smaller dimensions, which 
suggest an Arctic form of the English species. 

Before dealing with the flowers which may possibly belong 
to Ginkgo digitata, we may briefly describe the fossil leaves 
represented in the Museum Collection. 



39,211. PI. IX. Fig. 1. 

This unusually perfect specimen has a lamina 3*8 cm. deep and 
6 cm. broad, with numerous and well-preserved forked veins. The 
upper part only of the petiole has been preserved. Cf. Brongniart's 
pi. vi. his, fig. 2 ; also Eichwald, pi. iv. fig. 6. The veins are very 
clearly shown, and follow a course similar to that in the leaves of 
the recent species.

This represents a more deeply lobed type, similar to the leaf

placed by Sternbei"g and others in a distinct species — C. Huttoni. 
If this form of leaf be compared with the more deeply dissected 
leaves of G. biloba, as for example the recent leaf figured by 
Lindley & Hntton in their plate xxvii. and those figured by 
Saporta and Gardner in their respective works, it will be seen 
that the more deeply divided lamina is in itself no sufficient 
reason for a separate specific designation. This type of leaf is 
represented by some examples approaching closely the fonn shown 
in Fig. 4, PI. IX., which is referred to Baiera PhilUpsi, Xathorst.

Ginkgo digitata (flowers). Text-fig. 45. 

Although we cannot speak with certainty as to the connection of 
any fossil flowers with this species, it is very probable that some 
imperfect examples of male flowers and isolated pollen-sacs met 
with in the English rocks may, as Xathorst first suggested, be 
(presumably regarded as the flowers of this species.

GINKGO. 



In 1829 Phillips figured some small leaf -like bodies as "unknown 
leaves " ; the original specimen, which is in the Cambridge Museum, 
reveals the identity of these bodies with some more perfectly jjre- 
served fossils in the Leckcnby Collection, British Museum, and 
elsewhere, which Nathorst regarded as pollen - sacs probably 
belonging to Ginhgo digitata. On the label attached to Phillips' 
figured specimen Bean has written the following note from 
Brongniart: — "Appears to be a very curious plant, but the 
specimen is incomplete, so that I cannot form any opinion about 
it. 1838." On another specimen Nathorst wrote : " Male flowers 
of Ginhgo digitata.''^ A more perfect specimen in the Leckcnby 
Collection,^ to which Nathorst has referred in his notes on Jurassic 
plants in English Museums, shows a portion of a central axis from.

which are given olf at right angles a few short and slender filaments, 
bearing ellii)tical bodies (pollen-sacs), either two or three together 
at their tips; some of them appear to bo still in their original 
position, while others have fallen off the filaments. This fragment 
agrees with the male flowers of G. hiloha, as also with the numerous 
and better preserved male flowers figured by Heer from Sibeiia and 
elsewhere, and leaves no doubt that Phillips' "unknown leaves" 
are pollen-sacs of Ginkgo. In most cases Heer simply refers to his 
specimens as male flowers of Ginkgo, and connects them with 
G. Sibirica, Heer, and other species; but some of the later examples 
which he describes are spoken of as species of Antholithus. "We 
might refer the specimens of male flowers to such a genus as

Androdrohus, but where there is so good a reason, as in this 
instance, for believing the flowers to belong to a definite plant, it 
is hardly necessary or advisable to introduce a separate designation. 
The imperfect specimen from Franz Josef Land figured by 
Xathorst* as a male flower of Ginkgo, is hardly distinct enough 
for determination.

a median line indicating the longitudinal dehiscence. Fragments 
of the slender axis of the male flower are associated with the loose

<;alled by Phillips in the description of his fig. 23, pi. vii.=) ; and 
by Nathorst, " male flowers of GinJcgo digitata.''^

The small form of leaf for which Xathorst suggested the name

G. digitata, from which it differs in the smaller size of the lamina 
imd in the somewhat more pointed segments. Some of the small 
Ginkgo leaves, recently described by Xathorst and by Newton & 
Tcall, from Franz Josef Land,' may be compared with this type.

Genus BAIERA. 
[BrauD, in Miinster's Beitrage, Heft vi. p. 20, 1843.] 

1. Baiera gracilis, Bunburj-, ex Bean MS, 

2. Baiera Liindleyana (Schimper). 

3. Baiera Phillipsi, Nathorst. 

Braun defined his genus Baiera as follows : — 

"VenaD primarise frondis plurics dichotomae ; vense secundaria} 
ac venulae in areas hexagonales elongatis irregulariter con- 
fluentes ; sporocai'pia capsulaeformia, ovalia pedunculata, temata 
vel biternata." 

This diagnosis does not apply in all respects — e.g. as regards 
venation characters — to species of Baiera, but subsequent work 
has demonstrated more satisfactorily the true character of Braun's 
genus. 

The genus Baiera includes several species of Palaeozoic and 
Mesozoic age, some of which are almost certainly near relatives of 
the maidenhair - tree. Braun, ^ the author of the genus, applied 
the name to some Triassic leaves which agree with Ginkgo in 
shape, but differ in possessing a lamina with more numerous and 
narrower segments. Braun and Schenk'"' included Baiera among 
the ferns, and it is not improbable that some of the species may be 
best compared with such recent ferns as Actinopteris radiata, Link, 
or with species of Schizoia, e.g. S. dichotoma, Sw., S. elegans, Sw., 
and others. 

Valuable evidence as to the Gymnospermous nature of some typ^s 
of the genus is afforded by examples of flowers and seeds described 
by Schenk,^ Heer,* and other authors. Among Palaeozoic leaves 
refen-ed to Baiera, we have Baiera mrginiana, Pont. & "Wh.,*

from the Permian of Virginia, B. Raijmondi, Ren.,'' from Charmoy, 
and some other species. The genus was probably most widely 
spread during the Jurassic period, but there is fairly strong evidence 
in favour of extending its range to the Palaeozoic epoch. In 
considering the range of Baiera it is important to bear in mind the 
absence of any well-marked distinguishing features between some 
species of this genus and some of the more dissected forms of 
Ginkgo leaves. Among Jurassic leaves of the Ginkgo type — e.g. 
G. digitata (Brongn.) and Baiera Phillipsi, Nath. — it is easy to 
select a series illustrating a gradual transition from leaves with 
an entire lamina to those with a dissected lamina and linear 
segments, conforming in all respects to Braun's genus Baiera, and 
to leaves which some authors include in the genus Jeanpaulia?

less blunt point. The breadth and number of the segments vary- 
considerably in different leaves. 

The plant to which Bunbury gave the name Baiera gracilis had 
previously been named by Bean ScMzopteris gracilis, but the 
latter term was never published, and is quoted, therefore, as 
a manuscript name. Bunbuiy compares his species with Cyclopteris 
Huttoni, Stemb. (=: Ginkgo), and sees no reason for removing these 
two species from the ferns ; he quotes Acrosticlium peltatum as 
a recent fern of similar habit. The leaves of Baiera gracilis differ 
but little from some of those usually refeiTcd to Ginkgo Huttoni, 
Baiera longifolia or B. Phillipsi, and Solenites furcatus ; all exhibit 
the same general form, and are characterized by forked segments ; 
in B. gracilis the segments are linear and narrower than in 
G. Huttoni, but broader than in the plant we have named 
B. Lindleyana. 

Some of the Siberian leaves figured by Hcer as Ginkgo lepida ' 
are indistinguishable from Baiera gracilis ; Heer's Greenland 
species, Baiera incurvata"^ and B. Czekanowskiana^ may also be 
compared with B. gracilis. A fragment described by Fontaine 
from the Potomac beds as Baiera foliosa * bears a resemblance to 
Bunbury' s species, and a specimen figured by Schcnk from China 
as B. angustiloba ^ is also not unlike the English type. 

Some specimens of Bunbury's species appear to be identical with 
the Bhaetic species Baiera (or Jeanpaulia) Muensteriana (Presl)." 
This probable identity, or at least striking resemblance, is 
illustrated by specimen 39,209 (PI. IX. Fig. 3), which may be 
refeiTcd to as B. gracilis, forma Muensteriana. 

The form of leaf represented by Baiera gracilis, Bunb., is one 
which was very widely distributed in Mesozoic times ; in addition 
to the species already mentioned as possibly identical with this 
type, several others might be quoted, but in most cases the data 
are insufiicient to enable us to do more than call attention to 
resemblances without necessarily implying specific identity. It is

probable that tbe short synonymy given for Baiera gracilis might 
bo considerably extended without great risk of error. The number 
of fossil leaves described by Heer and other authors, which exhibit 
every stage in the transition from the obvious GinJcgo type to 
the naiTow lobed Baiera forms, demonstrate the futility of 
attempting to draw definite lines between one species and another 
when we have only mere fragments to guide us.

A large piece of rock with impressions of several leaves, which 
vary considerably as regards the number of linear segments. 
The example figured agrees with Bunbury's type-specimen, and 
represents a faii'ly common form of the species. The tips of 
the segments are obtusely pointed ; in some of the leaves the 
segments are longer than as shown in Fig. 5 and less spreading, 
as in some of the examples of Jeanpaulia Muenstertana figured 
by Schenk. The longest leaf-stalk measures 7 cm. Specimens 
of Baiera Lindleyana occur in association with the leaves of 
B. gracilis. Labelled by Bean Schizopteris gracilis.

In this example the segments arc more numerous than in the

habit of the leaf is similar to that of the specimens with few 
segments. The leaf is about 10 cm. broad, 4 '5 cm. high.

Type-specimen. The type-specimen of Baiera microphylla, Phill.,. 
is in the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 389). 

The specimens on which Lindley & Hutton founded this species,, 
were obtained by "Mr. Williamson, junr.," from Haiburn Wyke,. 
near Scarborough. They made use of the generic name Solenites- 



BAIEEA. 267" 

"rather for the sake of giving the plant a station and a name,'^ 
than because they "had any reason for considering it of the same 
nature as S. Murrayana, fiu-ther than its similarity of appearance." 
The Solenites furcata of Lindley & Hutton differs from S. Murray ana 
of these authors in consisting of a definite petiole, which di^-ides- 
into several regularly forked and narrow bi-anches, disposed in 
such a way as to form a broadly triangular stalked leaf, having 
veiy slender aeicular segments. Braun referred Solefiites furcata, 
L. & H,, to his new genus Baiera, and Brongniart, in his- 
Tableau, mentions this species imder Braun's name as Baiera 
furcata, but, in view of the distinct form of the English plant, he 
considers Psilotites a more suitable generic designation. Saporta 
at first included Solenites furcata in the genus Jeanpaulia, and 
regarded it as a fern. Schimper * had previously altered the name 
given by Lindley & Hutton to Jeanpaulia Lindleyana, eri'oneously 
including Sphenopteris longifolia, Phillips, as a synonym. At 
a later date Saporta substituted his genus Trichopitys, founded 
in 1875, and classed the plant among the Conifers in the tribt! 
Salisburiai, reproducing the figures of Lindley & Hutton to illustrate 
the similaiity between the Oolitic species and the Permian species 
IVicJiopitys heteromorpha. The resemblance between the two plants 
is not, however, very close, and it is doubtful whether they should 
be refen'ed to the same genus. Nathorst expresses doubt as to the 
ad^isability of separating Solenites furcata from the genus Baiera. 
Solms-Laubach,'' on the other hand, favours the generic identity of 
the two plants included by Lindley & Hutton in their genus 
Solenites. Solms speaks of Solenites furcatus as "known only 
from some scanty remains in not too good a state of preservation." 
The examples in the Leckenby Collection, including both young 
and fully expanded leaves, ai'e well-preserved impressions, and lend 
support to Braun's view that Baiera is the most appropriate genus. 
Solenites furcata differs from such plants as Bunbury named Baiera 
gracilis, and Schenk and Hcer referred to Baiera Muensteriana 
(Presl), only in the narrower form of the segments, and shows no 
differences sufficient to justify the adoption of another generic term. 
The specific name Lindleyana has been retained, as the most

•convenient designation ; the original name furcala of Lindley & 
Hutton was adopted in 1843 by Braun, -who called the plant Baiera 
Jurcata, but in 1865 Hccr named some fragments of leaves from 
Keuper beds of Switzerland SclcrophylUna furcata, and afterwards 
substituted the generic name Baiera, possibly in ignorance of the 
use of the same name by Braun in 1843. 

Baiera Lindley ana may be compared with B. spetshergensis, jS"ath.,* 
irom the Upper Jurassic of Advent Bay, also with B. tenuifolia, 
-Johnst.,^ from the Jerusalem Coal-basin of Tasmania.

The specimen on which Phillips founded the species Sphcnopteria 
longifolia is shown in Text-fig. 47. If this di'awing, which was 
carefuUy made from the type-specimen, be compared with Phillips' 
figure, it will be seen to bear a somewhat closer resemblance to 
a leaf of the Baiera type than is suggested by the original 
illustration. The example shown in Fig. 4, PI. IX., is practically 
identical with the type-specimen. There is but little difference 
between the present type of leaf and some of the more deeply 
dissected and narrower lobed forms of Ginkgo digitata (of the 
shape usually refeiTed to Ginkgo Huttoni') on the one hand, and 
Baiera gracilis on the other. It is convenient, however, to retain 
a definite specific name for this fonn of leaf, with its linear and 
bluntly teraiinated segments, as it constitutes a fairly distinctive 
type. The specific name longifolia was applied by Pomel to a leaf 
of somewhat similar but not identical form, which he named 



270 



BAIEBA. 



Dicropteris longifoUa ; Pomcl's plant was subsequently spoken of 
by Heer and other authors as Baiera longifolia. 

To avoid confusion between Phillips' English plant and Pomcl's 
species, Nathorst proposed to name the former Baiera PhilUpsi, 
a name which may well be adopted. It is true that Phillips used 
the specific name longifolia several years before Pomel applied the 
same term to a distinct plant, but the long-established use of Baiera 
longifolia in Pomel's sense renders it advisable to adopt the new 
name Phillipsi for the English species. 

Baiera Phillipsi agrees closely with some forms of Ginlcgo sihirica 
and G. lepida as described by Heer from northern latitudes.

leaves from the Lower Oolite rocks referred to the genera Ginkgo 
and Baiera.

Genus BEANIA. 
[Carruthers, Geol. Mag. vol. vi. p. 1, 1869.] 

The genus Beania was instituted by Carruthers in 1869 for 
a specimen from Gristhorpe, and diagnosed as follows : — 

"Female fruit composed of scales arranged in loose spikes; scales 
stalked and peltate, supporting two ovoid sessile seeds, one on each 
side of the pedicel." 

The general structure of Beania is very similar, as Carruthers 
pointed out, to that of the female flower of the Cycadean genus 
Zamia, except that the individual carpophylls are farther apart 
than in the recent species. If we imagine the intemodes of the axis 
of a Zamia strobilus considerably elongated, we have a structure 



272 BEANIA. 

closely resembling that of Beania. The affinity of the genus is 
considered at length in the account of the species B. gracilis. 
Sonae imperfect fragments recently described by Shirley from 
Ipswich, Queensland, as Beania geminata, are too indefinite to be 
determined.^

Museum. Type of Lindley & Hutton, in the Oxford Museum. 

A central, fairly stout woody axis, bearing scattered and loosely 
disposed secondary axes at right angles to the main axis ; these 
secondary axes, which are probably of the nature of carpophylls, 
have the form of slender pedicels terminating in a peltate distal 
expansion, on the inner side of which are borne two oval or sub- 
spherical seeds with a fleshy outer coat. 

The original diagnosis given by Carruthers is as follows: — "Axis 
of the female inflorescence slender ; scales or slender stalks placed 

V Shirley (98), pl. xx. p. 16. 



BEANIA. 273 

at right angles to the axis, peltate, apex of the scale small, scarcely 
covering the ripe seeds ; seeds sessile, ovoid, slightly acuminate at 
the apex, symmetrically arranged on the two sides of the pedicel, 
reflexed." 

The author of the species points out the close resemblance 
of Beania gracilis to the female flower of the Cycadean genu^i 
Zamia ; it agrees with such a strobilus as that of Z. muricata, 
Willd. (figured by Can-uthers), "except that the apices of the 
scales are not adpressed, but the scales are scattered over the axis 
so as to form a very loose spike." 

The two specimens figui'ed by Lindley & Hutton in 1835 as 
Sphcereda paradoxa may possibly belong to the same species, but 
the fossil shown in fig. 1 of the Fossil Flora has a much broader 
axis and apparently smaller seeds than that shown in fig. 2. The 
latter, as CaiTuthcrs notices in his paper, is identical with Beania 
gracilis ; I have not been able to find the original specimen of fig. 1 , 
and without more e\-idenee than is afforded by the drawing it 
is impossible to be certain as to its real nature. It may represent 
a flower of similar form to that of Beania gracilis, but specifically 
distinct. Lindley & Hutton express no definite opinion as to the 
nature of the fossils which they name Sphcereda paradoxa. 

In the third edition of Phillips' Geology of Yorkshire a figure is 
given of a specimen identical with Camithers' t}i)c, and the opinion 
expressed that it "may possibly be the rhizome of a fern with 
young fronds in the circinate condition." • 

Schimper classes Beania gracilis among the Cycads, and 
suggests that the greater elongation of the intemodes between the 
carpophylls, as compared with the more closely packed carpophylls 
of recent Cycads, may be due, in part, to growth in length after 
fertilization of the oviUes.- This is hardly likely ; the looser habit 
. of the flower is no doubt an original character, and one which 
forms an interesting peculiarity of this Jurassic species. The 
suggestion of Saporta that this loose habit of Beania gracilis may 
be due to the fall of some of the carpophylls cannot be accepted ; 
an examination of several specimens of this species enables me to 
assert that there is no evidence to support such a view.^

274 BEANIA. 

Single seeds, like that figured by Phillips as a ' winged seed,' 
are not nncommon ; there is no trace of a wing in the example 
figured by Phillips (original specimen in the York Museum), but 
the coat is considerably wrinkled, a character well marked in 
Beania seeds, and pointing to a thick fleshy integument such as 
that of the seeds of the recent genus Cycas. 

It is difficult to decide by what Jurassic plant Beania gracilis 
was borne. Carruthers and other authors compare the flower with 
those of Zamia and other recent Cycads, and would presumably 
connect it with one of the numerous Cycads of Lower Oolite age 
which bore pinnate Cycadean fronds. So far as we know, the 
abundant Cycadean fronds belonged to plants with Bennettitean 
flowers; this is, I believe, proved to be the case in Zamites gigas 
( Williamsonia gigas), which bore the well - known Williamsonia 
type of flower; and it is very probable that the plant with the 
common fronds described by Lindley & Hutton as Pterophyllum 
pecten bore the flowers known as Williamsonia Leckenbyi, Nath. 
The Cycadean trunks from Marjdand and Dakota in America, and the 
species known as Bennettites Gihsonianus of England, also the various 
Bennettites stems of Italy and elsewhere, produced floral structures 
very different from those of recent Cycads, and hardly comparable 
to such a type as that of Beania gracilis. We have, indeed, no 
satisfactory instance of a female Cycadean flower of Mesozoic 
age which can be reasonably connected with a plant bearing 
Cycadean foliage. The splendid Cycadean fronds which Hecr 
has figured from the Cretaceous of Greenland as Cycas Stcenstrupi,^ 
is represented as associated with a fossil bearing a distinct 
resemblance to a carpophyll of the Cycas type ; but an examination 
of the type- specimen in the Copenhagen Museum convinced me 
that the drawing of the supposed carpophyll does not accurately 
represent the facts. There is nothing on the slab containing 
the well - preserved Cycadean frond which can be reasonably 
compared with the carpel of Cycas. It is true there are a few 
stems, such as Cycadeoidea gigantea, Sew., which show no trace 
of Bennettitean flowers, but these are exceptional, and it must 
be admitted that such evidence as we have points to the conclusion 
that the majority of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous Cycads

BEANIA. 275 

-w^erc members of the Benncttiteac, and did not conform in the 
characters of their reproductive organs to the existing members 
of the Cycadaceae. 

Is it possible, therefore, that Beania gracilis may have belonged 
to Ginkgo or some other member of the Ginkgoacese? We are 
familiar with male flowers in the Yorkshire rocks which agree 
with those of the maidenhair-tree, and in all probability were borne 
by species of Ginkgo, but as yet wc have no evidence of the 
existence in Britain of female flowers of the modem Ginkgo type. 
Heer has described a few fragments from the Arctic regions, 
recalling the female flowers of Ginkgo biloba, but no satisfactory 
specimens are known. There is, indeed, a considerable difference 
between Beania gracilis and the female flowers of Ginkgo as they 
exist at the present day, but it is conceivable that the Mesozoic 
representatives of this genus, which exhibits so many points of 
contact with the Cycads, may have possessed reproductive organs 
more nearly related to those of recent Cycads than is the case with 
the surviving species. The male flowers of both fossil and recent 
Ginkgos consist of a central axis, bearing loosely disposed stamens, 
and are constructed on the same plan as Beania gracilis. The usual 
and normal female flowers of Ginkgo biloba consist of a strong axis 
bearing two terminal sessile ovules, but it is not uncommon to find 
examples in which the main axis bears several ovules, iri'egularly 
arranged and separated by fairly long internodcs, borne on slender 
pedicels inclined at a considerable angle to the stouter central axis. 
Such abnormal flowers ai'e of importance as at least showing 
a possible variation in the structure of the female reproductive 
shoot, and they afford a nearer approach to the type represented 
by Beania. The agreement is by no means perfect ; in the Ginkgo 
flowers the ovules are terminal, and the apex points outwards, while 
in Beania they are attached to the inner side of a peltate expansion 
of the carpophyll. But this is a difference insufficient to invalidate 
a comparison. If we imagine the ovules of Ginkgo tmned through 
an angle of 1 80° we should have the collar-like envelope occupying 
the same position as the peltate expansion in Beania. Some of the 
abnormal flowers of Ginkgo, such as those figured by Fujii ' and one 
recently figured by Miss Gowan and myself, approach more closely 



Fujii (96). 



276 CZEKANOWSKIA. 

to the JBeania type, and it is not improbable that these examples- 
indicate ancestral features, as Celakovsky ' has suggested. Without 
wishing to overstrain such arguments as may be adduced in favour 
of this view, we prefer to regard Beania gracilis as a female flower, 
which was more probably borne by a plant belonging to the 
Ginkgoacese than by a member of the true Cycadacese. 

A type of flower similar to Beania has been described by 
Nathorst as Zamiostrolus stenorachis, from the Rhsetic plant-beds- 
of Scania.*

Genus CZEKANOWSKIA. 

[Heer, Flor. foss. Arct. vol. iv. (2), p. 65, 1877.] 

Hecr places the genus Czehanowskia among the Coniferae, and' 
defines it as follows : — 

*' Folia numerosa in ramulo abbreviuto caduco fasciculate, 
subulata, rigida, dichotoma, squamis compluribus persistentibus 
circumdata. Flores feminei racemosi. Fructus pedunculo brcvi 
insidens, nuculis duabus valde appro ximatis."

Lindley «& Hutton ^ in the genus Solenitcs and compared by them 
with the recent Isoetcs, are considered by Heer to belong to

a Ginkffo-liko tree in which the short shoots were deciduous. The 
iorm of the needles suggests a comparison with Pimcs, Larix, or 
Ccdrus, but the distinct forking in several of the Siberian examples 
•described by Heer led that author to cite the maidenhair-tree 
{Ginkgo) as the more probable type with which to compare the 
fossils. In some of the more perfect specimens the tuft of long 
needles is enclosed at the base by a few small scale-leaves, as in 
the short shoots of Finns and Larix. Several of Heer's specimens 
exhibit numerous oval swellings on the leaves, which it is suggested 
may possibly represent spores ; but if the plant is a Conifer, and 
not a Vascular Cryptogam, it is possible, he suggests, that these 
swellings are tho result of the ravages of a fungus. 

The frequent association of small seeds with the leaves of 
Czekanowskia led Heer to regard the two as parts of the same plant. 
The two Siberian species instituted by Heer, Czekanowskia rigida 
and C. setacea, closely resemble one another, and it is, I believe, 
impossible to separate the two forms by any satisfactory difPerences. 

In 1873 Sapoita' included Solcnifes under Unger's genus 
Jcanpaulia ; but in a later work "^ both Jeanpaulia and Solenites ai-e 
transfen-cd to Saporta's genus Trichopitys, founded on a Permian 
plant, T. heteromorpha. Saportsi refers more piu'ticularly to the 
type named by Lindley & Hutton Solenites furcata. By most 
authors, such specimens as those originally named by Lindley & 
Hutton Solenites Murrayana are placed in the genus Czekanotcskia, 
and refen'cd to the Coniferae. Schimpcr,^ on the other hand, 
includes Solenites Murrayana in the genus Isoetes. The form of 
the leaves and their occun-ence in tufts lend support to the 
comparison -svith this genus, but the occuiTencc of the scale-leaves 
forms a point of resemblance to coniferous shoots. Solms-Laubach 
includes Solenites Murrayana ^ as a possible member of the Isoeteae, 
but expresses considerable doubt as to its true position ; he points 
out the desirability of examining the structure of the epidermis to 
ascertain if stomata are present, a character, ho adds, which would 
strengthen the comparison with Czekanowskia. The thin carbo- 
naceous film representing the needle-like leaves of Solenites

frequently peels off the surface of the rock, and may be readily 
cleared for microscopical examination by means of Schulze's 
macerating solution. Several pieces of leaf have been prepared in 
this way, and in some instances rendered more distinct by staining 
with safranin ; the outlines of the epidermal cells stand out clearly, 
and rows of stomata, with oval guard-cells, extend along the 
length of the needles. 

The form of the cells is shown in the small piece of cuticle 
represented in Fig. 48 ; the fragment is not large enough to 
demonstrate the occurrence of numerous stomata in rows, but if 
a strip of leaf be carefully prepared and mounted, the manner of 
occun-ence of the guard-cells is at once apparent. In the majority

of the species of Isoetcs there are very few or no stomata, but in 
the land-forms, /. Duriai, Bory, and /. Systrix, Borj-, stomata are 
abundant.^ An examination of a leaf of the latter species reveals 
about four rows of stomata which occur over two large air-spaces ; 
but the resemblance of the epidermal cells to those of Solcnites is 
much less striking than in the case of coniferous needles. I have 
no hesitation in expressing the opinion that the structure of these 
Jurassic leaves agrees most closely with that of the needles of 
recent Conifers, and affords confirmatory evidence in favour of 
classing Solenites or Czekanowshia among the Coniferae. The 
examination of the epidermal cells of Solenites (^Czekanowskia) led

CZEKANOWSKrA. 279 

Hchenk to refer the genus to the Coniferae rather than to the 
Isoetaceae.^ 

We have as yet no absolute proof of anj- organic connection 
between the reproductive organs described by Heer and the 
Czekanowskia leaves, but the e\-idence, so far as it goes, favours 
the view that needles and seeds belong to the same plant. 

The surface of the shale from the Yorkshire plant-beds is 
occasionally covered with an accumulation of the fine grass-like 
leaves of Czekanowskia, reminding one of the crowded needles 
carpeting the ground in a pine forest ; some of the Siberian 
specimens are met with in similar profusion on the surface of the 
rock, and in the New Jersey Amboy clays a species of Czekanowskia 
occurs in equal abundance." 

Several authors have represented Czekanowskia leaves as 
occasionally dichotomously branched, a character in favour of 
a comparison with Baiera and the Ginkgoaceas ; among the 
numerous examples of the leaves of Czekanowskia Miirrayana that 
I have examined, no absolutely certain case of branching was 
found. The long unbranched leaves of Czekanowskia remind one 
of the needles of Pinus longifolia, Salisb., and other long-leaved 
piaes, but the branched type of leaf met with in some forms 
of the fossil genus is not in accord with a comparison between 
Czekanowskia and the AbietineaB. We may for the present regard 
this genus as a Conifer of doubtful affinity, and as possibly 
a member of the Ginkgoacese.

The name Flabellaria ? viminea, applied by Phillips to an 
imperfect specimen of Czekanowskia Murrayana, never came into 
general use, and, in spite of the few years' priority of Phillips' 
term, it is better to adopt the better known name of Lindley & 
Hutton, by whom the plant was first described. A specimen in 
the Whitby Museum (No. 2493) labelled Flabellaria viminea is 
possibly the type of Phillips. 

The type-specimen of Lindley & Hutton, obtained from Gristhorpe 
Baj^, was compared by these authors with Isoetes and Pilularia, 
also with grasses and other monocotyledons. The bladder-like 
swellings shown in their figure are no doubt due to the partial 
peeling off and separation of the carbonaceous film from the 
surface of the shale ; no definite swellings like those represented 
in the fossil flora can be detected in the specimen. Their drawing 
of the epidermal cells does not afford any indication of the 
occurrence of stomata, but in all the loaves of which I have 
examined fragments under the microscope stomata are abundant 
(Fig. 48). 

In the third edition of the Geology of the Yorkshire Coast, 
Solenites Murrayana is compared with the more slender examples 
of Baiera gracilis. 

A comparison of several specimens of Heer's two Siberian 
species, Czekanowskia rigida and C. setacea, in the Museum 
Collection, leads me to regard some of the examples of both these 
' species ' as identical with the type-specimen of Lindley & Hutton 
(Fig. 49) ; others differ from the type in their greater fi-equency 
of the dichotomous branching of the individual leaves, and agree 
more closely with the specimens named by Lindley & Hutton

■Solenites furcata} Williamson pointed out, in a note to Lindley, 
that the numerous needles of Solenites Murrayana occasionally

is illustrated by specimens in the Lcckenby Collcctiou, Whitby

distance, there is no indication of forking, but in a few cases tliei'c 
appear to be indications of dichotomy. K'athorst, in a letter to 
Heer,^ expressed the opinion that the leaves of the English 
examples were nnbranched, but, as he pointed out, there is 
considerable diiflculty, owing to the crowding of the leaves, in 
tracing a single leaf throughout its entire length. In Heer's 
specimens the needles are often single, and the usual absence of 
forking in the Yorkshire specimens is no serious obstacle to their 
identity with some of the Siberian fossils. As the name given 
by Lindley & Hutton is much older than those of Heer, and seeing 
that we have the type-specimen of Solenites Murrayana before 
us, it is probably the better plan to retain the older specific 
name, including under that designation some of the examples 
figured by Heer as Czehanowshia rigida and as C. setacea. The 
generic name Czehanowshia, which has come into general use, may 
be substituted for Solenites. 

The fragmentary nature of the specimens of Czehanowshia, and' 
the wide distribution of the genus in rocks of various ages, render 
an accurate specific determination practically impossible. In the 
English specimens we seldom find any trace of the scale-leaves or 
the very short axis which bears the needles, and the resemblance of 
isolated needles alone is of little value as an index of identity or close 
affinity. Such a fossil as Nathorst" has figured from the Ehaetic 
beds of Stabbarp in Scania as Czehanowshia rigida appears identical 
with some of the Yorkshire specimens, but it would be rash to 
definitely include the Swedish and English examples in one species. 

Type -specimen. The type - specimen of Lindley & Hutton is 
No. 3685 in the British Museum Collection. (Text-fig. 49.) 

Needle-like leaves borne in tufts on deciduous short shoots, 
surrounded at the base by small imbricate scale-leaves ; the foliage- 
leaves usually about 1 mm. in breadth or somewhat narrower, and 
reaching a length of over 17 cm. The needles are in most cases 
unbranched, but occasionally forked; the epidermis consists of 
rectangular cells slightly longer than broad; numerous stomata 
occur in longitudinal rows, separated by a few rows of epidermal 
cells without stomata.

Our knowledge of the organs of reproduction is hardly sufficient 
to enable us to diagnose the flowers or seeds. I^o well-marked

Type-specimen. In the Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 305). 

The species Araucarites Phillipsii was founded by Carruthers on 
some single scales, and on an imperfect rolled specimen of a female 
cone. He gives the following description : — 

"Scales from the centre of. the cone cuneato, nearly as broad as 
long, lower scales thickish throughout, without membranous 
wings." 

The detached scales of this species are frequently met with in 
collections of Inferior Oolite plants, but no good specimen has been 
found showing the cone as a whole. Occasionally single seeds are 
found detached from the scales ; these are elliptical in form, and 
slightly more than 1 cm. in length. Although the material on 
which Cari'uthers founded his species is somewhat meagre, there 
can be no reasonable doubt that it affords trustworthy evidence of 
the existence of cones of the Araucarian type. The occuiTcnce of 



286 CEYPTOMEEITES. 

Araucarian cones in the "Wealden rocks of Sussex^ and sncli 
specimens as Araucarites Sudlestoni., Carr,,- from the Coralline 
Oolite of Yorkshire, affords proof of the comparative abundance 
of Araucarian species in Mesozoic floras; but as yet we are not in 
a position to do more than suggest what form of vegetative shoots 
were borne by these species of Araucarites. It is, however, very 
probable that the twigs of Wealden and Inferior Oolite age referred 
to Fontaine's genus Nageiopsis and Bunbury's species Cryptomerites 
divaricatus were borne by plants closely allied to Araiicaria. 

The English Jurassic species may be compared with the Indian 
specimens described by Feistmantel as Araucarites cuichensis ^ and 
A. hachensis} Similar, but somewhat larger, cone-scales have 
'been described by Saporta under the name Araucaria Moreauana. 

As CaiTuthers has pointed out, Araucarites PhiUipsi agrees most 
closely with the recent species of Araucaria included in the section 
Columhea.

Type-specimen. The original of Bunbury's figure is iu the 
Leckenby Collection, Cambridge (No. 303). 

In his description of the two .specimens from the collection of 
Dr. MTirray on which the species was founded, Bunbury gives the 
following diagnosis of the vegetative characters of the plant: — 

"The main a.xis is stout, straight, and rigid; the branches and 
branchlets spread widely and stiffly, having a rigid and wiry 
aspect, althougli the brandilets are very slender and somewhat 
zigzag. Lea\es apparently two-ranked, mostly alternate, but 
placed at very irregular intei*vals and often nearly opposite ; they 
are compressed sideways, and taper regularly from the vertically 
dilated decurrent base to a sharp point ; are of rigid appearance, 
most commonly straight, sometimes decidedly incurved ; have no 
prominent lateral rib or angle, but arc rather faintly and irregularly 
.striated, perhaps in consecxucnce of the shrinking of their tissue. 
Those towards the base of each twig are often rather stouter than 
the rest." 

Bunbury compares the specimens with Cryptotneria japonica, but 
he also recognizes a resemblance to Araiccana ezcelsa, R. Br., and 
A. Cunninghamii, Ait. 

Nathorst^ has drawn attention to the resemblance between 
Cryptomerites divaricatus and the .sterile branches of some forms of 



» Xathorst (80'), p. 72. 



288 NAOEiorsis, 

Araucaria (section Eutucta). In the absence of reproductive 
structures it is difficult to form an opinion as to the affinities of this 
plant, but the striking similarity which the leaves and the form of 
the branches of the fossil type bear to the recent Australian species 
Araucaria Cunningliamii, Ait., leads me to favour the view of the 
Araucarian relationship of Bunbury's species. 

I have little doubt as to the specific identity of the specimens 
named by Phillips Cryptomerites rigidus with C. divaricatus^ Bunb. 
This Conifer is represented by a very small number of specimens 
in collections of Inferior Oolite plants ; the best specimens I have 
seen are Bunbury's type-specimen (Leckcnby Collection) and a few 
good examples in the Manchester Museum. 



Genus NAGEIOPSIS, Fontaine. 

[Potomac Flora, p. 194, 1889.] 

This generic name was chosen by Professor Fontaine for certain' 
vegetative shoots bearing a resemblance in the form of the leaves 
to recent species of the genus Podocarpus, included in the section 
Nageia, in which the leaves possess numerous veins and not 
a single midrib.^ As no reproductive organs have been found 
in connection with the vegetative shoots of Nageiopsis, the position 
of the genus cannot be definitely fixed. While admitting the 
marked similarity between Fontaine's genus and certain species 
of Podocarpus, a comparison may also be made, as Nathorst has- 
suggested, with the Australian Conifer Araucaria BidwilUi, Hook..

NAGEIOPSIS. 289 

diagnosis. The close agreement between the English specimens 
and some of the larger fossils refeiTed by Fontaine, in his 
Monograph- of the Potomac Flora, to the genus Nageiopsis, leads 
me to adopt this name, although it is not improbable that the 
genus Araucaria may prove to be the nearest li\-ing representative. 
A specimen of similar foi-m to that from the Inferior Oolite of 
Yorkshire has been described from the Wealden beds of Sussex,' 
but the two tj'pes are probably not specifically identical. 

One of the Whitby specimens (2377) bears a label on which is 
written "Probably the leaves of Araucaria PhillipsV^ Nathorst, 
in his notes on English specimens, refers to what is probably the 
same plant; he speaks of fragments of branches in the Whitby

Without more evidence we cannot decide definitely between the 
Podocari)eaD and Araucariinae as the family in which to include 
the vegetative shoots referred to the genus Nageiop&is, but on the? 
whole tlie comparison with Araucaria is more likely to be neai'er 
the truth. 

The English specimens, which I have described for the sake of 
convenience under a distinct specific name, may prove to be

identical with one of the American forms figured by Fontaine ; the 
Potomac species Nageiopsis microphylla, Font., N. descrescens, Font., 
and others ^ are very similar to the Whitby fragments.

This fragment shows clearly the form and disposition of the 
broadly linear leaves, 1 •2-1*5 cm. in length; the axis of the 
specimen has a length of 3 cm. 

Another specimen (2377) in the Whitby Collection consists of 
several pieces of branches similar to that shown in the figure ; 
in one fragment the axis of the shoot is branched, as in the 
Wealden specimen already referred to. Each leaf is traversed by 
several parallel veins, which converge slightly towards the point 
of attachment of the narrow leaf-base. 



? CONIFERS INCERT^ SEDIS. 

Genus PAGIOPHYLLUM, Heer. 

[Secc. Trab. Geol. Portugal, p. 11, 1881.] 

Saporta "^ and other authors incline to the view that the species 
included in Heer's genus should be regarded as members of the 
Araucarineae, but this opinion is based very largely on a similarity 
of vegetative structures, which does not receive decisive support 
from such evidence as is afforded by the more important 
reproductive structures. While recognizing the possibility of 
a, close relationship between this widespread Mesozoic genus and 
Araucaria, it is safer to regard Pagiophyllum as one of the 
numerous extinct forms which cannot be safely included in any 
particular family of the Coniferae. It is difficult to draw 
a satisfactory line between the genera Pagiophyllum and Elatides, 
and perhaps the English Jurassic species, which I have placed 
in the fonner genus, should rather be referred to Heer's genus 
Elatides, the name under which Nathorst^ has recently included the 
plant described by Lindley & Hutton as Lycopodites WilUamsonis.

Type-specimen. The specimens figured by Lindley & Hutton 
(pi. xciii. figs. 1 and 2) are in the Manchester Museum (]^os. 16 
and 48). The original of Phillips' figure (pi. viii. fig. 1) is in 
the York Miiseum. 

Vegetative shoots are monopodially branched, the latest branches 
being given off at an acute angle ; the leaves, which are thick and 
fleshy, angular in form, and with a falcate, acuminate, and dorsally 
keeled distal portion, are crowded and spirally disposed. 

The female cones, about 6 cm. in length, consist of a central axis, 
beaiing imbricate scales with broadly acuminate tips; the male 
-cones have a length of rather more than 2 cm. ; the sporophylls 
ai"e given off at , right angles from a fairly stout axis ; they have 



292 rAGIOPHYLtXTM. 

a triangular ajncal portion, at right angles to the sporophyll axis^ 
which is characterized by a median vertical keel. 

As the list of sjTionyms shows, this fairly common species has 
been referred to various genera ; that it is a Conifer there is na 
longer any doubt, both male and female cones having been found 
in organic connection with the vegetative branches. It is, however, 
a little difficult to decide in which family of the Coniferaj 
Pagiophyllum WiJliamsoni should be included. The form of the 
leaves and the general appearance of the branches at once suggest 
a comparison with certain species of Araucaria, e.g. Araucaria 
excelsa, R. Br., the Norfolk Island pine, but such knowledge as 
we possess as to the structure of the cones does not enable us 
to decide the question of Araucarian affinity. The male flowers 
are not sufficiently well presei'ved to afford any decisive evidence 
as to the number of the pollen-sacs or their manner of attachment 
to the stamens ; their external form agrees closely with that of the 
male flowers of various tj-pes of the Abictinca^, and in itself does 
not supply confirmatory evidence of a close relationship with 
Araucaria. 

The present species bears a close resemblance to Pagiophyllum 
peregrinum (L. & H.), of Liassic age, described fi-om the English 
Lias and elsewhere. Some of the coniferous twigs described under 
Heer's generic name Elatides are very similar to Pagiophyllum 
Williamsoni ; as Hecr points out, the Siberian Jurassic species 
Elatides falcata ^ resembles the English type, but the leaves of the 
latter are much broader at the base. The distinction between the 
two genera Pagiophyllum and Elatides is by no means well marked, 
and either generic term might be used as a suitable designation for 
certain IVLosozoic coniferous twigs. 

Several specimens of this species are included in the collections 
of Whitby, Scarborough, Cambridge, and elsewhere ; both the 
male and female cones are not infrequently found in organic 
connection with the vegetative shoots.

not conform to the vegetative characters of the typical species, 
B. mamillare. The species referred to Cheirohpis agree, as regards 
the form of the leaves, with TFiddrmgtonia and Sequoia gigantea ; 
the cone-scales are described as bearing solitary seeds. The plant 
which Schenk ' named Brachyphyllum Muensteri is the type species 
of Schimper's genus.

CHEIEOLEPIS. 295 

The description is accompanied by a sketch made by Professor 
Williamson from a specimen in his collection. 

The two examples shown in Text-figs. 53a and b are, no doubt, 
identical with the type of Phillips ; the more acute angle at which 
the small branches are given off can hardly be regarded as a 
difference of specific importance. This type of Conifer is represented 
by a single specimen in the British Museum ; those shown in 
Figs. 53 a and b are from the Scarborough and Whitby Museums 
respectively. With such fragmentary material it is impossible to 
construct any satisfactory diagnosis, and in the absence of cones we 
cannot adduce e^ddence of a trustworthy character as to the probable 
relationship of this rare form to recent genera. Such few specimens 
as have been obtained seem to warrant the separation of this species 
from Pagiophyllum Williamsoni; the falcate and stiff leaves bear 
a fedi'ly close resemblance, on a small scale, to the large leaves of 
the latter species, but the much smaller size of the vegetative twigs 
of Cheirolepis setosus and the somewhat different habit afford 
distinctive characters. 

The question of generic designation is not an easy one to decide 
in dealing with fragmentary branches of fossil Conifers. The 
twigs of this species have not been found with any trace of cones, 
and the only characters available are afforded by the habit and 
the form and aiTangement of the leaves. Certain authors have 
used the genus Brachyph/llum in a wide sense, so as to include 
branches with sharply pointed, small, and somewhat falcate 
keeled leaves, as well as branches with closely adpressed broad 
scale-leaves, such as occur in Brachyphyllum mamillare, Brongn. 
It is better, however, to restrict this generic designation to fossil 
Conifers in which the leaves are broad and inserted on the 
stem by a rhomboidal base, and to include branches with the 
narrow and more spreading leaves under different generic names. 
There is the closest resemblance between the specimens repre- 
sented in Fig. 63 and Brachyphyllum Muensteri, as figured by 
Schenk from beds of Khaetic age ; ' while hesitating to refer the 
Yorkshire fossils to this species, the agreement of the vegetative 
characters suggests specific identity. Saporta- substitutes the

genus Cheirolepis for Brmhyphyllum in describing Schcnk's species, 
and wisely restricts the application of the latter term. The 
Wealden Conifer, Sphenolepidimn Kurrianum (Dunk.)/ also bears 
a distinct resemblance to the Jurassic species ; but in both 
^phenolepidium and Cheirolepis the nature of the cones is included 
as an important generic character in the diagnosis. In the case 
of Phillips' Brmhyphyllum setosum we are without the important 
evidence which cones would supply, and it must be admitted that

the form of the vegetative branches alone is insufficient as a guide 
to affinity when we have to deal with such a type as that 
represented in Fig. 53. 

While admitting the impossibility of determining with certainty 
the true generic nature of the specimens of this species, we 
may adopt Cheirolepis as a generic designation in preference to

Bracliyphylluin, and as inilicating the very close resemblance 
between the Yorkshire plant and Cheirolepis Muenstcri, Schenk. 

The vegetative shoots branch at a more acnte angle than in 
Brachyphyllum. The leaves are crowded, siDirally disposed, fairly 
stout, and falcate in form. 

The fragments of this species resemble in habit Sequoia gigantea, 
Lindl. & Gord., and maybe compai'ed also with Araucaria Balansa, 
Brongn. & Gris., and Bacrydium Franklmii, Hook., but the material 
is too meagre and ill preserved to admit of a full diagnosis or of 
a satisfactory comparison with recent Conifers.

The genus Brachyphyllum,^ like many other fossil Conifers, 
■cannot be safely assigned to any definite position among recent 
genera. The habit of the branches and the form of the leaves 
favour a comparison with some species of the Tasmanian genus 
Arthrotaxis : but we are not in a position to speak with confidence 
as to afl&nities of this common Mesozoic genus.

Type-specimen. The original of pi. clxvii. of Lindley & Hutton 
is in the Manchester Museum (No. 52). 

In habit the branches of Brachyphyllum mamillare resemble those- 
of Arthrotaxis cupressoides, Don ; the branches of different order are- 
given off at a fairly wide angle. The leaves are small, fleshy, 
triangular in shape, with a median dorsal keel, crowded and 
spirally disposed. There is no satisfactory evidence as to the 
nature of the flowers. 

There has been some confusion on the part of palaeobotanical 
authors between Brachyphyllum mamillare, Brongn., and Thuites 
expansus^ Sternb. ; the specimens to which Phillips and Lindley & 
Hutton applied the latter name are undoubtedly identical with 
those designated by Brongniart Brachyphyllum mamillare. 

The specimen from the Gristhorpe plant-bed, which is figured 
by Lindley &, Hutton as Thuites expansus, is, I have no doubt, 
specifically identical with the plant which these authors represent 
in plates clxxxviii. and ccxix. as Brachyphyllum mamillare. The 
specimen has a length of 9-5 cm., and represents an imperfectly 
preserved twig, bearing short lateral branches clothed with 
spirally disposed and fleshy broadly triangular scale-leaves, closeh' 
adpressed to the axis. Each leaf terminates in a sharp point, 
and is traversed on the abaxial surface by a fairly prominent 
median ridge. ^

with the Indian Brachyphyllum mamillare of Feistmantel, which

not discovered any specimens which appear to be specifically 
distinct from B. mamillare.

[Prodrome, p. 108, 1828.] 

In speaking of this generic name Brongniart points out its 
artificial character, and calls attention to the fact that several 
other recent Conifers agree very closely with the Yew in the 
form of the vegetative shoots.^ In the ahsence of any evidence 
as to the character of tlie flowers, we may conveniently retain 
Brongniart' s genus for the fragments described by Leckenby from 
the Inferior Oolite of East Yorkshire.

linear leaves, traversed by a single median vein. The leaves are 
spirally disposed and more or less closely set. Flowers unknown.

size and habit of the shoots, clearly demonstrate that Leckenby's 
plant is a Conifer and not a Cycad. On the type-specimen of 
Cifcadites zamioides (Geological Museum, Cambridge) Xathorst has 
Aviitten "a Conifer of the genus Palissya.''* Another specimen in 
the Lockenby Collection is labelled in Bean's handwriting Zamia 
angmtifolia. 

The few fragments of this species that are known are too small 
to enable us to make any suggestions as to relationship with 
recent types. It is probable that Taxites zamioides is specificallj- 
identical with some of the Coniferous branches described by 
Fontaine from the Potomac beds under the generic name 
Cephalotaxopsis ; a term applied to twigs with distichous leaves

CONCLUSION. 



Jn the present volume we have practically confined our attention 
to the fossil plants from the Inferior Oolite (Bathonian) strata of 
the Yorkshire coast. A comparison of the Yorkshire flora with 
those of the Stonesfield Slate and other Jurassic horizons will 
be more appropriately undertaken after the completion of the 
systematic treatment of the species in a succeeding volume. The 
flora with which we are now concerned is the richest among 
Mesozoic floras from British localities both as regards the number 
of species and the abundance of material, and is scarcely surpassed 
by any assemblage of fossil plants from extra-British regions. 

A general survey of a geological flora should include the con- 
sideration of such points as the following: (i.) The geographical 
distribution of the several types composing the flora; (ii.) a com- 
parison with older and younger floras, and with recent species ; 
(iii.) the conditions under which the plants grew ; and (iv.) the 
recognition of the most characteristic species which may serve as 
the best indices of geological age. 

In attempting to determine the geographical range of the several 
-elements of the Yorkshire Coast flora, we have to face serious 
difficulties. It is often impossible to decide whether an English 
species is identical with or merely closely allied to a species 
recorded from another region. If we ignore all records but those 
which can be interpreted with satisfactory accuracy, without any 
doubt as to the specific position of the plants, our comparisons 
would be restricted within limits which would not enable us to 
do full justice to the available data. In the comparison of floras 
more or less widely separated geographically, the recognition of 
specific identity is naturally desirable, but the object of a com- 
parative study of fossil floras is primarily to determine resemblances 
and differences as regards the general facies of the vegetation rather 
than the absolute specific identity of individual plants. In the 
following table I have indicated the geographical range of the 
English species, without giving any indication as to the degree of 



CONCLUSION. 303 

"Coufidence with whicli each determination has heen made. Many 
of the extra-British types are undoubtedly specifically identical 
with Yorkshii-e species, but in other cases ihc foreign species may 
possibly be identical with those from the Yorkshire coast, or they 
may represent specifically distinct but closely allied types. 

It should be borne in mind, therefore, that the accompanying 
table is not intended to convey the idea that all the references to 
the occurrence of Yorkshire plants in foreign localities necessarily 
imply specific identity ; each record denotes the occurrence of either 
the same species or a closely allied or representative species. In 
the lists of plants given in the Introductory section and in the 
•comparisons instituted in the systematic treatment of each species, 
I have attempted to show how far I regard English species identical 
with or closely allied to extra-British types. 

In addition to the geographical regions given in the table, it is 
worthy of note that some Rhsctic species from South American 
localities * are very similar to English types ; fi-om Madagascai- 
also Zeiller * has recently recorded the occun-ence of a few species — 
•e.g. Kluh'a [Pecopferis) exilis — identical with or nearly related to 
Inferior Oolite types. 

I propose to consider more fully the stratigi'aphical correlation 
of Mesozoic floras in a subsequent volume, but there are some 
points of geological and botanical interest which should be noticed 
in reference to the flora with which we are at i^resent concerned. 
The comparison of the English plants with the Upper Gondwana 
flora of India and with Australian floras of corresponding geological 
position, has confirmed me in my opinion that the diflPerences 
between the Mesozoic vegetation of the !N'orthem and Southern 
Hemispheres have been exaggerated. Geographical separation of 
fossil species frequently leads to an unnecessary amount of specific 
tlistinction in the naming and determination of plants. We naturally 
hesitate to admit specific identity between plants from such widely 
separated regions as England on the one hand, and India, South 
Africa, and Australia on the other ; but the too frequent use of 
<listinct generic and specific designations has obscured the botanical 
resemblances of the Northern and Southern floras. The number

CONCLUSION. 



of Indian and Australian fossils recorded in the above table, 
some being no doubt identical and others specifically distinct but 
closely allied species, illustrates a marked similarity between the 
vegetation of the ancient Gondwana Land and the European 
continent. In Jurassic times there was no doubt a much greater 
uniformity in the vegetation of the world than exists at the present 
day. A closer analysis of the Gondwana floras and a more detailed 
comparison with those of the Northern Hemisphere may enable us 
to recognize well-defined distinguishing features suggestive of 
botanical provinces such as existed in the Lower Gondwana 
period, — but this is a matter for subsequent treatment. 

The resemblance between the "Wealden flora, described in two 
previous British Museum Catalogues,^ and the Jurassic flora of 
East Yorkshire, has been already noticed. In a few instances 
we find what appear to be identical species common to the 
two periods, e.g., Matonidium Goepperti., Ruffordia Goepperti, and 
Ginkgo digitata. In addition to the occurrence of the same 
species, we recognize several plant-types in the two floras which 
demonstrate the marked similarity between the Wealden and 
Inferior Oolite floras. Comparing the two floras, we notice as 
common characteristics the absence of Angiosperms and an 
abundance of Cycads and Ferns : the Conifers probably played 
a somewhat more prominent role in the Wealden than in the older 
Jurassic vegetation. 

The following figures illustrate the similarity in the composition

regarded as giving more than an approximate estimate of the 
composition of each flora. It is probable that the vegetation 
which has left fairly abundant traces in the Wealden sediments 
of the South-East of England and in the Inferior Oolite beds of 
Yorkshire, flourished under very similar climatal and physical 
conditions. 

A comparison of the Inferior Oolite plants with those of Rhsetic 
age from Germany, Scania, and other regions leads us to recognize 
a few examples of what appear to be identical species, e.g., Podo- 
zamites lanceolatus and Sphenopteris princeps. Several instances of 
closely related types have also been pointed out in the introductory 
and systematic sections of this volume. 

"We may next briefly consider some of the more conspicuous 
members of the Inferior Oolite flora from the point of view of 
their resemblance to other fossil types as well as to recent plants. 

Equisetales. — Equisetites columnaris is one of the commonest and 
most characteristic plants in the Yorkshire flora. Its abundance 
lends support to the view that the small seams of coal met with 
in the sti'ata of the Estuarine Series were probably in great measure, 
if not entirely, formed from the remains of the Equisetaceous 
plants which grew in the Jurassic swamps. The thicker stems 
described under the name Equisetites Bcani are comparable in size 
to E. arenaceus of Triassic age, and surpass in diameter the 
characteristic Rhaetic form E. Maensteri. Compared with such 
Wealden species as Equisetites Lyelli and E. Burchardti the Inferior 
Oolite Equisetaceoe are distinguished by the greater thickness of 
their stems, and in this respect they carry us a stage further from 
the modem Horsetails towards the arborescent representatives of 
the Equisetales, which flourished during the Triassic and Palaeozoic 
epochs. 

FiLicES. — Among the Inferior Oolite ferns there are several 
species which cannot be referred to any particular subdivision of 
the Alices, but on the other hand we have sufficient evidence in 
many cases to admit of a satisfactory identification of family 
affinities. The species Sagenopteris PhilUpsi, which for reasons 
already stated I have included among the Alices rather than the 
Rhizocai-peae, may not improbably belong to the Polypodiaceae, 
but of this we have not sufficient evidence. The species is of 
interest as a common type, which forms a connecting link on 
the one hand with the older and larger Rhaetic forms Sagenopteris 



308 coNCirsioif. 

rlioifolia and S. Goeppertiana and on the other with the smaller 
"Wealdcn type S. Mantelli. 

In the case of the abundant and handsome fern Cladophlehis- 
denticulata we lack convincing evidence of family relationship, hut 
such indications of soral characters as occur point to a polypodiaceous- 
affinity. The hipinnatc form of frond of this species is practically 
identical with that of certain Rhaetic ferns, e.g. Cladophlehis 
Roesserti, and with ferns of "Wealden age, e.g. C. Alhertsi. Ferns 
of the Cladophlehis denticulata type are very abundant in Mesozoie 
strata, but in most cases we are unable to determine their systematic 
position ; this form of frond is in itself of little or no use as an 
aid to the recognition of botanical relationship. 

As Nathorst has stated, it is not improbable that some of the 
Sphcnopteroid fronds from the Inferior Oolite rocks may be best 
compared with species of the recent Polypodiaceous genus Bavallia. 

Passing from these rather doubtful examples of Jurassic 
Polypodiaceae, we may turn to other more satisfactory fern species. 
It is clear that the Matoninea? played a prominent part in the- 
vegetation of the Oolitic period ; Matonidium Goepperti and the 
two species of Laccopteris, L. polypodioides and Z. Woodwardi, arc- 
fairly abundantly represented by well-preserved fertile specimens. 
This interesting family, with two surviving species in the Malayan 
region, occupied an even more prominent position in the Rha3tic- 
than in the Jurassic period. From Rhaetic times, when the family 
appears to have reached its maximum development, the Matoninese 
gradually decrease in importance, and at the present day the genus- 
Matonia alone remains as a survival from Mesozoie times. 

Dipteridinm. — This family, treated as a subdivision distinct from, 
the Polypodiacea? for reasons already discussed,^ appears to have 
a geological history similar to that of the Matonineae. Dictyo- 
phyllum rugosum, one of the more abundant of Inferior Oolite types, 
is practically indistinguishable from D. Nilssoni, D. acutilobum, and 
other Ehsetic species. The genera Camptopteris and Clathropteris 
afEord other Rhaetic examples of the same family, and in the 
"Wealden flora we have the genus Protorhipis, which approaches 
most closely to the surviving fern Bipteris, another tropical 
remnant of a Mesozoie family.

Osmundacea. — Todites Williamsoni must have been one of the 
most conspicuous and abundant ferns which flourished during the 
Jurassic period. It is possible that Sphenopteris princeps should 
also be included in this family, but we lack such convincing 
evidence of affinity as is afforded by the fertile specimens of 
Todites Williamsoni. The Rhaetic species described by Schenk as 
Acrostichites Goeppertianus appears to be barely distinguishable 
from the Inferior Oolite species of Todites x from the "VVealden 
plant-beds no satisfactory representative of the Osmundacca? has so 
far been recorded. 

The Cyatheacece are represented by such species as Coniopteris 
hymenophylloides, one of the most characteristic of the Yorkshire 
Coast ferns, C. guinqueloba, and C. aryuta. There is a striking 
resemblance between some of these fossil Cyatheaceaj and the isolated 
recent fern Thyrsopteris elegans. The Inferior Oolite flora was 
characterized by an abundance of ferns of the Thyrsopteris type. 

Among Wealden ferns we have the genus Frotopteris, which 
may probably be included as a member of the Cyatheaceee, a type 
which extends into still more recent geological periods. 

SchizccacecB. — In addition to the somewhat doubtful Ruffordia 
ijoepperti of "Wealden and Inferior Oolite age, we have an excellent 
example of this family in the widely distributed Klukia exilis, 
a species which may also be closely matched among "Wealden ferns. 
Neither the Cyatheaceae nor the Schizaeaceaj are represented by 
any well-authenticated llhoetic species, but in the Palaeozoic genus 
Senftenhergia we have a still older tj-pe which exhibits well-marked 
Schizaeaceous characters. Klukia exilis agi'ees precisely as regards 
the structure of the sporangia with the living members of the 
family, but in the form of the frond it differs from the modern 
representatives of the Schiza^aceae. 

The Yorkshire Coast Flora has not so far yielded any recognizable 
•examples of the Gleicheniaceaj or the Marattiaceae ; species of the 
former family are known to have existed during the Wealden 
period, and we have a representative of the latter family in the 
Rhaetic fern Taniopteris Mtiensteri. From the Jurassic plant-beds 
•of Poland, Raciborski has described a member of the Marattiaceae 
Tinder the name Banaa. Neither the Hymenophyllaceae nor the 
Ophioglossaceae appear to have any representatives among the 
Inferior Oolite plants. The statement that certain families of ferns 
are not represented, simply means that we have not discovered any 



310 CONClTJSIOlf. 

fossils among the Yorkshire plants which afford sufficiently good 
evidence to warrant their inckision in these families ; it is possible 
that Tceniopteris vittata, which is one of the commonest species, 
may belong to the Marattiacea?, and it may be that some of tbe 
Sphenopteroid fronds possessed Hymenophyllaceous soral characters. 

It is among the ferns of the Southern Hemisphere that we find the 
closest resemblances to the Inferior Oolite species. The Malayan 
species Matonia pectmata is essentially a Jurassic and Lower 
Cretaceous type ; the Indian and Malayan Bipieris recalls Dictyo- 
phyllum rugosum. Thyrsopteris elegans of Juan Fernandez, Bichsonia 
a/rhorescens of St. Helena, Balantium culcita of Madeira and the 
Azores may be cited as Cyatheaceous types most nearly allied to 
those of Jurassic age. Todea harbam, a native of New Zealand 
and tropical Australia, is the nearest living representative of 
Todites Williamsoni. The Schizaeacese are to-day widely distributed 
in both hemispheres, but several members of the family are 
characteristic of Southern latitudes. 

GrNKGOAiES. — The two genera Ginkgo and Baiera, although both 
appear to have been in existence in the Triassic and even Permian 
periods, are essentially characteristic of Rhsetic and Jurassic floras. 
The Inferior Oolite species of Baiera are very similar to Rhsetic 
forms, while GinJcgo digitata is for the most part a Jurassic and 
Cretaceous type of wide geographical range. The trees, which 
bore the Ginkgo and Baiera foliage, and flowers, which were 
probably rather more Cycadean in structure than those of the 
recent Maidenhair-tree, must have formed a striking feature in 
the Jurassic vegetation. The extreme northern range of Baiera 
and Ginkgo points to a vigorous development of the Ginkgoales 
during the latter part of the Mesozoic era. 

Cycadales. — At no period in the earth's history were the 
Cycadaceaj more abundantly represented than in Jurassic times. 
WtUiamsotiia, Nilssonia, and Otozamites are the most conspicuous- 
examples of the Cycadales in the Yorkshire flora; WilUamsonia 
gigas may be compared with the English Wealden type W. 
Carruthersi ; fVilliamsonia pecten is one of the most abundant and 
at the same time one of the most characteristic of the Inferior 
Oolite species. The Beanettitese appear to have attained their 
maximum development in the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous 
periods ; the two species WilUamsonia gigas and JV. pecten are 
typical Jurassic types, and Anomozamites Nilssoni recalls the Rhaetic 



CONCLtrSIOlT. 311 

species A. minor. The species of Otozamt'tes, which played a very 
prominent part in the composition of the Inferior Oolite flora, 
afford points of contact with both Rhaetic and Wealden types, 
but this genus is primarily characteristic of Jurassic floras. I have 
already pointed out that some of the Jurassic Cycadean fi'onds 
exhibit a closer approach to the fronds of ferns than is the case 
with modem Cycads, with the exception of Stangeria paradoxa} 

NiUsonia compta is one of the commonest species in the Yorkshire 
Coast flora, but its close resemblance to N. polymorpha and other 
Rhaetic types detracts from its value as an index of geological 
age. In the Wealden flora the genus NiUsonia is represented by 
a smaller-leaved form, iV. Schaumhurgemis. No example of the 
genus Cycadites has so far been recognized among the East 
Yorkshire plants. 

Ctenis falcata is a characteristic species in the Inferior Oolite 
flora ; the larger form, described as Ctenis sp., recalls some of the 
species described by Raciborski from Poland as well as certain 
Rhaetic examples from Scania and elsewhere. 

Podozamites lanceolatus is a Mesozoic type of wide geographical 
range occurring chiefly in Rhaetic and Jurassic strata, and less 
abundant in more recent beds ; it is not improbable that this species 
may be best compared with the conifer Agathia australis rather 
than with Cycads. 

CoKiFEB^. — The Conifers are much less abundant than cither 
the Ferns or Cycads ; it is impossible to determine how far this 
may be taken as an indication that they played but an insignificant 
part in the vegetation, or as resulting from the less favourable 
position of the Conifers — which probably occupied higher ground 
farther from the area of sedimentation — as regards the chances 
of fossilization. In all probability the Coniferse were less 
numerous and represented by fewer types than either the Cycads 
or Ferns. So far as we are able to form an opinion as to the 
systematic position of the Inferior Oolite Conifers, it would 
seem that their affinities are chiefly with the Araucaiinae. 
Nageiopsia anglica represents a type which is much more abundant 
in North American beds of Wealden or Upper Jui'assic age than in 
European regions ; it may be compared with Araucmia Bidwilli 
or with certain species of Podocarpus. Araucarites Phillipd is 

1 Ante, pp. 170, 203, 208, 212, etc. 



312 CONCLUSION. 

certainly an Araucarian type ; Pagiophyllum Williamsoni recalls 
Araucana excelsa, and Cryptomerites divaricatus bears a close 
resemblance to Araucana Cunninghamii. The vegetative characters 
of Brachyphyllum mamillare invite a comparison with the Tasmanian 
genus Arthrotaxis. 

Admitting the danger of drawing conclusions from such imperfect 
data as the Conifers afford, we are probably justified in asserting 
that Arauca/ria, Arthrotaxis, and possibly Podocarpus and Agathis, 
among existing genera agree the most nearly with Inferior Oolite 
types. The Abietineae have no certain representives in the East 
Yorkshire flora ; this family assumed a much more important 
position in the succeeding Wealden and Lower Cretaceous 
vegetation. 

In conclusion, we may endeavour to answer the question, what 
assemblage of recent plants would we select as best illustrating 
the character of the Inferior Oolite vegetation? The large 
Equisetums of the marshes of South America most nearly recall 
the fossil forms, while a species of Selaginella, a genus of wide 
distribution, and represented by several tropical examples in the 
Southern Hemisphere, may be taken as affording the nearest approach 
to Lycopodites falcatus. Among Ferns we have Matonia pectinata, 
Dipteris conjugata, Todea harbara, species of Lygodium and Anemia, 
Balantium {Dichsonia), and Thyrsopteris. Among recent Cycads, 
the fronds of certain species of Zamia, Encephalartos, Bowenia, and 
others recall the habit of some of the Jurassic types. Ginkgo hilola 
alone survives as a representative of the Ginkgoales, and is probably 
but slightly different from its Jurassic ancestors. Of existing 
Conifers we may select Araucaria, Arthrotaxis, and Podocarpus as 
types exhibiting the nearest approach to the Inferior Oolite species. 
It is in the Southern tropics that we must look for existing forms 
which afford the most striking links between the vegetation of 
to-day and that which has left imperfect records in the Jurassic 
sediments of the Yorkshire coast. The climate was presumably 
more tropical than that of North Europe at the present day ; 
there is no evidence that the plants of Jurassic times grew under 
conditions which induced xerophytic characters, moisture being 
probably abundant and favourable to the luxuriant growth of 
Equisetums and Eems.
