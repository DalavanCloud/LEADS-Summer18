70. BERBERIDACEAE. Barberry Family 

The importance of this family in Peru centers about Berberis lutea 
and relatives, the "ccarhuascassa" or "palo amarillo," sometimes 
called "espino amarillo," whose yellow wood, with that ofBocconia, 
furnishes the beautiful, yellow dye seen in ponchos and other clothing 
to this day (Ruiz & Pavdri). 

1. BERBERIS L. Barberry 

Reference: Schneider, Bull. Herb. Boiss. II. 5: 33^*8, 133-148, 
391-403, 449-464, 655-670, and 800-831. 1904-1905. 

Shrubs with or without spines, these typically trifurcate. Leaves 

, simple in the Peruvian species, fasciculate, entire or more or less 

l aculeate-dentate. Flowers yellow or reddish yellow, variously dis- 

r- posed, with 3-4, most often 6, deciduous sepals and usually as many 

petals, these biglandular within. Filaments as many as the petals, 

. dentate or edentate. Ovules 1-12, laterally inserted at the base of 

< the 1-celled ovary, the fruit 2-3-seeded. Schneider has given a 
' careful and discriminating account of the Andean forms which, 
5 however, with more knowledge, probably will be found to constitute 

fewer species. For the purposes of this work it has seemed practical 

to follow earlier authors and group the forms primarily according to 

y> the nature of the inflorescence, which for well developed specimens 

^ of nearly all species is quite obvious. It may be stated that the work 

^ of P. E. Citerne, cited several times on the following pages, is a 

thesis of the Faculty des Sciences de Paris, Se"rie B, No. 183. 1892, 

very rare and sometimes filed in libraries under this citation. 

v? Omitted from the following synopsis is the name B. rotunda 

~ Macbr. Candollea 6: 3. 1934, which, as casual observation of the 

type has shown, has nothing in common with this family except 

; a certain similarity in foliage. Because of this, the specimen had 

w been laid in a cover with species of Berberis described the same 

< evening and perhaps flowers of Berberis became mixed with the 
* aberrant sheet. 

Flowers racemose (sometimes very shortly so), racemose-corymbose, 

or paniculate. 

^ Flowers borne in more or less peduncled panicles.

Berberis Benoistiana Macbr., sp. nov. 

B. agapatensis Lechl. similis, glabra; foliis ellipticis basi fere 
rotundatis infra medium usque ad apicem sparse spinuloso-dentatis, 
ad 4 cm. longis, 3 cm. latis, subtus perobscure nervatis haud reticu- 
latis perdense papillosis; sepalis fere 6 mm. longis; petalis ca. 4 mm. 
longis. At one time referred to Lechler's species of southern Peru, 
and obviously closely allied, but that shrub is somewhat puberulent 
and the strongly reticulate-veined leaves are relatively less papillose. 
The papillae on the under leaf surface of the new species are so 
abundant that they seem to form a tissue. Moreover, the habitat 
is strikingly different. B. Benoistiana was found on a fog-drenched 
summit in open, mossy places. A slender shrub, 1 meter high, the

ately spreading, little flexuous; spines slender, straight, spreading, 
usually trifid, about 15 mm. long; leaves 5-8-fasciculate, obovate- 
cuneate, sessile or subsessile, pale green, concolorous, entire, thinly 
callous-margined, subcoriaceous, mostly 12 mm. long and 5 mm.

pillose; flowers in short racemes or subcorymbs, these 1-1.5 cm. long; 
pedicels obscurely but obviously puberulent, 2-3 mm. long; open 
flowers 4-5 mm. broad, the obovate sepals and petals subequal, 
about 3 mm. long; stigma large, sessile. Type collected by Pentland 
in Bolivia, near the Peruvian boundary. B. Keissleriana Schneid., 
808, of Bolivia has linear-spatulate leaves, definitely papillose 
beneath; B. Rechingeri Schneid., 808, similar, has broader, epapillose 
leaves, and simple or no spines. Neg. 34507.

Berberis brumalis Macbr. Candollea 6: 4. 1934. 

Glabrous, the long, yellowish green, nearly terete branches 
unarmed; leaves 5-7-fasciculate; petioles short-dilated at the base, 
strongly canaliculate, about 7 mm. long, articulate below the elliptic- 
oval blade, this about 4 cm. long and 2 cm. wide, rounded-acute 
at the base, spinulose-cuspidate at the apex, the revolute margin 
entire or with 2-3 remote, spinulose teeth, coriaceous, lustrous and 
obscurely reticulate- veined above, dull, paler, scarcely veiny but 
papillose beneath; pedicels 1 mm. long, glabrous; sepals and petals 
scarcely 3.5 mm. long, minutely ciliate; stamens apparently almost 
2 mm. long, the connective strongly produced. The type has no 
inflorescence, but has one dissected flower. The position of the 
species now appears to me to be doubtful. In leaves it simulates 
species with fasciculate flowers, but it matches no species seen by me.

Glabrous, with trifid spines and black branchlets; blades coria- 
ceous, obovate-oblong, coarsely spinescent-serrate, 3-6.5 cm. long, 
1.5-2.5 cm. wide, lustrous above, papillose beneath and with light 
yellow nerves; petioles 2-8 mm. long; racemes sessile, lax, to 5 cm.

Berberis flexuosa R. & P. Fl. Peruv. 3: 52. pi. 281. 1802; 812. 

A densely branched shrub 2 meters high; branchlets slender, 
virgate, little angled, distinctly flexuous; spines slender, trifid, 1-3 
cm. long; leaves elliptic-obovate, acute at the short petiole, entire 
or with 2-3 teeth near the apex, becoming about 3 cm. long, 1.5 (-2) 
cm. wide, at maturity loosely reticulate-veined on both sides, papil- 
lose, especially above, paler and dull beneath; racemes (2-) 4-6 cm. 



FLORA OF PERU 673 

long, rather densely but obscurely puberulent; bractlets, even in age, 
puberulent, sessile, ovate-aristulate; pedicels finally 5-8 mm. long; 
flowers pale yellow, scarcely 5 mm. long; stamen connective pro- 
duced; style obvious; ovules 3-4; young berry lageniform. There 
may be two forms on the type sheet at Madrid, although all the 
material is referred by Diels to the type without question. The 
smaller branchlet has obovate leaves only 1.5 cm. long and 7 mm. 
wide, faintly veined, but apparently young; inflorescence 4-flowered, 
almost glabrous. The stem is very flexuous, as on the other branch, 
which doubtless is to be taken as the exact type. Neg. 12988. Ruiz 
and Pavon gave Tarma, Cheuchin, and Pillao as localities. The 
Paris Dombey material is much better. B. papillosa Benoist of 
Ecuador, which might be sought here, has larger leaves lustrous 
above, white-glaucescent beneath, and spinulose-dentate toward the 
apex. B. Rechingeri Schneid., 808, of Bolivia, has simple spines and 
leaves only half as large. My No. 1285, distributed as B. mono- 
sperma, had dark blue fruit used locally to make ink.

Similar to B. lutea, to which it could be referred as a variety, 
but at least the younger leaves conspicuously glaucous beneath; 
spines none, or trifid and rarely 9 mm. long; leaves to 2.5 cm. long, 
5-8 mm. wide, often 3-5-spinulose-dentate at the apex, densely 
granular-papillose beneath and above but the papillae often hidden

Berberis Humbertiana Macbr., sp. nov. 

Frutex glaberrimus; ramis vel ramulis virgatis haud flexuosis 
teretibus; spinis trifidis sat validis ca. 5 mm. longis; foliis fasciculatis 
sessilibus cuneato-obovatis apice 3-angulato-spinuloso-dentatis vel 
interdum lanceolatis, fere integerrimis et acuto-mucronatis, cartilagi- 
neo-marginatis, rigido-coriaceis, supra paullo nitidulis, subtus opacis 
prominente papillosis obscure laxeque reticulatis, 8-10 mm. longis 
4-5 mm. latis; racemis 6-15 mm. longis; pedicellis 2-2.5 mm. longis; 
floribus 4-6; sepalis subrotundatis cum petalis vix 3 mm. longis; sta- 
minibus obscure apiculatis; stylis nullis; fructibus globosis. With 
a superficial resemblance to B. lutea and its allies, this shrub is 
closely related to B. Keissleriana Schneid., 808, as remarked by 
Schneider on the type sheet, but that Bolivian plant is puberulent, 
has definitely petioled, narrower leaves, and more numerous flowers. 
B. Wettsteiniana Schneid., 809, similar, has much larger leaves, 
racemes to 4 cm. long, the flowers 6 mm. broad, on pedicels 3-5 mm. 
long. Citerne had given the Peruvian plant a herbarium name 
without, however, indicating the characters. It may commemorate 
the furtherance of botanical science by Professor H. Humbert, 
Director of the botanical museum, Museum of Natural History, Paris.

Similar to B. Jelskiana; flowers 3-4-fasciculate or distinctly 
racemose and the inflorescence then to 4 cm. long; pedicels and 
bracts apically glandular; leaves obovate-lanceolate, entire or with 
2-6 short teeth above the middle, to nearly 3 cm. long and 13 mm.

Berberis loxensis Benth. PI. Hartw. 125. 1843; 819. 

Similar in general to B. paniculata; leaves narrowly obovate, 
rounded at the minutely apiculate apex, narrowed below to the 
distinct petiole, the larger about 4 cm. long, 15-17 mm. wide, 
typically entire, very finely reticulate- veined on both sides; peduncles 
leafless; bractlets puberulent; pedicels 2-4 mm. long; sepals and petals 
about 3 mm. long. Differs from B. multiflora in its smaller leaves 
and flowers, the latter in narrower panicles; also, according to 
Schneider, the leaves have an obvious hypoderm (a specific char- 
acter?). He referred Weberbauer 1+199 to B. Beauvardiana with the 



676 FIELD MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BOTANY, VOL. XIII 

remark "leaves entire, pedicels longer." Some leaves show 1-3 short, 
appressed teeth and mostly they measure 3 cm. long, and 12 mm. 
wide, otherwise the specimen, in aspect at least, matches B. loxensis. 
Closely allied forms include: B. Warscewiczii (Klotszch) Hieron., 
819, leaves typically dentate but an entire-leaved form is doubtfully 
distinct from the present plant; B. Schwerini Schneid., 818, found 
near Peru, with larger flowers, is well marked, the leaves spinulose- 
dentate, drying brown beneath, obscurely reticulate-veined above; 
B. Hallii Hieron., 813, has shorter leaves and suggests B. flexuosa, 
the panicles being simple except near the base. Neg. 14301.

Berberis lutea R. & P. Fl. Peruv. 3: 51. pi. 280. 1802; 392. 

Unarmed, the branchlets more or less densely puberulent; leaves 
oblanceolate, 1-2 cm. long, 5-9 mm. wide, nearly always entire, or 
2-4-spinose-dentate, sessile or subsessile, lustrous, perhaps slightly 
glaucescent beneath but drying concolorous; flowers mostly 3-6- 
fasciculate; pedicels finally 6-10 mm. long, at least minutely puberu- 
lent, mostly about half as long as the leaves; style distinct; fruit 
ovate-elliptic; seeds usually 2, rarely 3-4, oblong-obovate. The 
original description reads "shrub glabrous," but the Madrid material 
is all definitely and persistently puberulent. The yellow petals are 
2-3 times longer than the reddish yellow calyx. The longer branches 
are unbranched for several decimeters (Ruiz and Pavon). With its 
wood the Indians dyed "bayatas" and cottons a yellow color, 
beautiful and permanent, and because of its durability made tool 
handles from it. Their name means "yellow wood with spiny 
leaves." (Ruiz & Pavon.) Negs. 8605, 27416.

above, lustrous and faintly reticulate-veined on both sides, not at 
all paler beneath, waxy-celled but epapillose; flowers 1-4-fasciculate, 
5-6 mm. wide; pedicels puberulent-pilose, 3-8 mm. long. This is 
the typical form of the variety. Citerne, 116, found the hypoderm 
cellular, but that of B. lutea fibrous. As Baehni has suggested to me, 
this apparent difference may well be the result of environment. 

Among several described variations of B. confer ta the following 
have been found in Peru, but since they have not been studied by me 
in relationship to B. lutea, they are not transferred; their existence 
suggests that the last five species in the key may not all be distinct 
from them or from each other: var. Spruceana Schneid., 393, spines 
none or simple, leaves to 20 mm. long, 7 mm. wide, entire, reticulate- 
veined on both sides, pedicels to 15 mm. long; var. hypopyrrantha 
Schneid. Bot. Jahrb. 42: 82. 1908, leaves 12-30 mm. long, 6-20 mm.

Spines 3-5-parted; leaves fasciculate, oblong-lanceolate, coria- 
ceous, dull, scarcely reticulate- veined, undulate or sometimes spinose- 
dentate; racemes erect, subsessile, shorter than the leaves. Schneider 
suggests that this poorly described plant, apparently cultivated from 
Lobb material (from Peru?) may belong to his group Truxillenses, 
represented in Peru by B. Jelskiana. Unless the name can be placed 
more definitely, it is best to ignore it.

71. MENISPERMACEAE. Moonseed Family 
Reference: Diels, Pflanzenreich IV. 94. 1910. 

A family comprising low-climbing, herbaceous vines and more or 
less scandent shrubs whose often small pistillate and staminate 
flowers suggest the Euphorbiaceae. The leaves of some species 
are entire and variously lobed, most often palmately, on the same 
plant, the fruits being grape-like in appearance. Economic interest 
of the family lies in a species of Chondodendron (cf. polyanthum) 
and Anomospermum reticulatum, known as "pani," which, as shown 
recently by Smith and Krukoff, Bull. Torrey Club 64: 401-409. 
1937, are ingredients of the arrow poison "curare." The first named 
plant is known by the Indians as "atinupa," the latter as "iku." 
In spite of monographic treatments of the family, the genera remain 
identifiable only on technical characters, largely those of the fruit. 
A supplementary, artificial key has therefore been devised for the 
Peruvian plants, but with either key the genera are difficult to dis- 
tinguish. Most of the material cited here has been determined by 
Diels.

Climbing shrubs with tuberculate bark and entire leaves. Pani- 
cles axillary, solitary or fasciculate from older branches. Staminate 
flowers with 6-18 sepals, the outer minute, pubescent within, the 
inner glabrate but ciliate, the tips finally reflexed. Petals 6, gla- 
brous. Stamens 6 and free or 3 and connate, the anthers longitu-

referable to the genus from Pebas, Loreto, collected by Castelnau, 
who noted it as used by the Oregones, less frequently by the Yaguas, 
as an arrow and fish poison under the name "pani." This was named 
Cocculus toxicoferus Wedd. in Castelnau, Exped. Ame"r. Sud 5: 22. 
1851. It may be described as follows: Scandent shrub with thin, 
smooth, gray bark, sparsely brownish-rugulose; branches terete,

7. SYNANDROPUS A. C. Smith 

A woody vine, the branchlets with loose, thin bark, the serrate, 
petiolate leaves palmately nerved at the base, pinnately nerved 
above. Pistillate inflorescence (staminate unknown) ample, panicled, 
with spreading branches, arising below the leaves, the flowers fasci- 
cled. Sepals 6, the outer small, the inner ovate, thin. Petals 3, 
opposite the 3 stamens whose anthers they enclose. Allied to Odon- 
tocarya and Somphoxylon, from both of which it differs in its less 
completely fused stamens, in having 3 instead of 6 petals, and 
usually, further, from the first in having only 3 stamens. The 
author suggests that each petal represents a complete fusion of 2. 
The validity of the genus evidently must depend on characters of 
pistillate flowers or fruit, because elsewhere, as in Disciphania, the 
number of petals and stamens may vary, and the number of stamens 
and degree of stamen connation varies in Odontocarya. Under these 
circumstances the validity of the present genus is extremely doubtful.

72. WINTERACEAE 

Reference: Robert P. McLaughlin, Trop. Woods 34: 21-22. 1933. 
This family, which often has been included in Magnoliaceae, has 
a different wood structure (cf. McLaughlin, op. cit. 35), and is 
distinguished readily by its exstipulate, pellucid-punctate leaves and 
never conelike fruits, the carpels being arranged circularly more or 
less in a single whorl.

bark. Sepals and petals in whorls. Flowers in axillary or terminal 
cymes or umbels. Stamens several, the anther cells distinct.

Leaves oblong-obovate, 7-13 cm. long, more or less glaucous 
beneath; flowers white, with 6 or more petals; fruit purplish black. 
Sometimes a tree to 18 meters. Botanists are not in agreement as 
to the specific limitation of this widely distributed plant, which 
exhibits great variation in the development of the inflorescence and 
in the leaves; cf. Miers, Contr. Bot. 1: 123-137. pi. 25-27. 1851-61, 
and Hauman, Comm. Mus. Nac. Buenos Aires 2: 50. 1923, who 
recognize a number of species. Eichler, on the other hand, in Mart. 
Fl. Bras. 13, pt. 1: pi. 30, 31, considers that there is one species 
with a number of forms.

Eichler and many others have related the story of the plant's 
discovery by Captain Winter who, accompanying Sir Francis Drake 
on the circumnavigation of 1577-1580, remained in the Magellan 
region after a storm to let his men recuperate, and used the bark of 
Drimys against scurvy, after which time it enjoyed great popularity 
in medicine for many years. It is now used only locally or as a 
condiment.

73. ANNONACEAE. Anona Family 
By Rob. E. Fries 

Ligneous plants with the leaves alternate, entire, and exstipulate. 
Flowers generally trimerous. Sepals 3, rarely 2, valvate or imbricate. 
Petals generally 6, in 2 series, valvate or imbricate, the inner some- 
times rudimentary or absent. Stamens generally numerous; anther 
cells adnate, the connective usually expanded above the anther and 
truncate. Carpels numerous, rarely few or solitary, generally 
free; ovules 1 or more. Fruiting carpels sessile or stipitate, free 
(monocarps) or united in a dry or fleshy mass. Seeds with or without 
an aril, with copious, ruminate endosperm and minute embryo. 
The large family Annonaceae, which is of pan tropic distribution, 
is represented in America by 33 genera, of which 17 are represented in 
the flora of Peru. For some years the author has been engaged on 
a monographic revision of the American genera and has published 
his results in Acta Horti Bergiani, volumes 10 and 12, to which the 
reader is referred. This revision is now nearly completed; of the 
South American genera only the largest and also the most difficult 
genus, Guatteria, remains. A preliminary revision has been under- 
taken but it can not be helped that the synopsis of the Peruvian 
Guatterias given below should be regarded as provisional. Further 
researches certainly will show that many additions and corrections 
will be necessary. 

The difficulty in the taxonomic treatment of Annonaceous plants 
is above all due to the fact that the material accessible at present 
is frequently incomplete. Numerous species are known with flowers 
only, others only in the fruiting stage. For this reason a comparison 
of the species is often impossible, which is particularly evident when 
it comes to the construction of the analytic keys. The keys given 
here are thus in many cases quite artificial and do not pretend to

In Amazonian Brazil, extending west to near the Peruvian 
border, another species of this genus occurs, Cymbopetalum odoratis- 
simum Barb. Rodr., which is very closely related to C. longipes. It 
has the same large flowers and long pedicels, but is distinguished by 
larger leaves with longer tips, quite glabrous and densely verrucu- 
lose-punctulate. It will probably also be found in Peru.

5. Anaxagorea pallida Diels is an incompletely known species 
from Peru, described from only fruiting material (Notizbl. Bot. 
Gart. Berlin 11: 79. 1931). Its leaves and long pedicels are 
reminiscent of Anaxagorea pachypetala, its leaf shape also of 
A. minor. Since the flowers, which afford the best specific characters 
of this genus, are unknown, it is hardly possible to decide the specific 
status of this plant.

The species is here taken in a wide sense, comprising a number 
of forms which may eventually be found to represent different species 
or varieties when more material is accessible. The Peruvian speci- 
men is characterized by its very glossy leaves, with few hairs on the 
lower surface, except on the nerves. 

Annona peruviana Humb. et Bonpl. ex Dun. (Monogr. Anon. 67. 
1817) is a synonym of A. glabra L. (A. palustris L.). The type was 
collected at Guayaquil in Ecuador (Humboldt & Bonpland 3804), 
and the species has never been recorded from Peru. A. glabra grows 
in humid forests near the sea and in mangrove swamps, and is charac- 
terized by large, ovate-elliptic, quite glabrous leaves, without pits 
on the lower surface, by large flowers with 6 free petals, and globose- 
ovoid, smooth fruit 7-12 cm. long with inconspicuous areoles.

Citrosma R. & P. 

Shrubs or trees with subentire or denticulate leaves, the petioles 
often unequal, opposite or sometimes ternate. Inflorescence axillary, 
often cymose. Receptacles nearly always campanulate or globose- 
urceolate, the sepals 4-7, sometimes obsolete, not rarely connate 
into an entire or lobed ring. Stamens 1-60, often unequal. Anthers 
dehiscing within. Styles filiform or ligulate, free or connate. Car- 
pels 4-20. Ovule basal, erect. The name of Ruiz and Pavon has 
been spelled by later authorities Citriosma. Since a large number 
of the Peruvian species are imperfectly known, a key based on char- 
acters of foliage and pubescence has been attempted, which, to be 
followed, requires, at least sometimes, material for comparison. 
The technical key is after Miss Perkins' but modified to group a 
majority of the species with few stamens together, because the genus

with few stamens. The several species proposed by me have been 
placed in the technical key, but their validity remains doubtful. 
The Peruvian forms, so far as known, are dioecious except as indi- 
cated, but the character, at least for some species, seems to be feeble. 
Ruiz and Pavon, referring to insect deposits frequent on these shrubs, 
observed in their journal that the branches appeared as though 
sprinkled with intent by saliva.

76. LAURACEAE. Laurel Family 
Reference: Mez, Jahrb. Bot. Gart. Berlin 5: 1-556. 1889. 

The majority of the many Peruvian species of this family are 
trees, often of great beauty, not rarely of great utility, and generally 
distributed in the montana. In the higher and drier regions there 
are a number of shrubs which, however, never ascend, according to 
Weberbauer, above 3,200 meters, and on the western ranges only to 
2,000 meters. The following remarks were written before Koster- 
mans' recent revisions. 

Few families afford a greater fascination in their study, for the 
characters, largely floral, are of a neatness and variation that seem 



820 FIELD MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BOTANY, VOL. XIII 

to be almost infinite in the number of combinations in which they 
have developed. Closely knit, therefore, the family has always 
been subjected to diverse interpretation regarding the lines to be 
drawn between groups of more or less obviously related species. It 
seems to me a great pity to divide a family of such economic and gen- 
eral interest into many narrowly limited genera, however logical 
this may seem, and I have written the following paragraphs hoping 
to call attention to the possibility of strengthening the generic segre- 
gation proposed by Mez, but not by further segregation, which, of 
course, is always the easiest way to deal with a family having many 
aberrant elements, thus isolating its larger and better defined groups. 

The relative value of characters used to indicate generic lines in 
the Lauraceae in Field Mus. Bot. 11: 19-20. 1931, I published a 
general comment has been too little considered, and a reconsidera- 
tion of at least some generic limits seems necessary. For instance, 
if treated relatively as other groups, Aniba should be defined to 
include Acrodiclidium (Licaria) and Endlicheria as regards Peru, as 
well as Silvia, Misanteca, Huberodaphne, Systemonodaphne, Phylloste- 
monodaphne, and Chanekea, so that species more nearly related to 
each other than to those of any other genus might conveniently have 
one generic name. It seems to me that the characters upon which 
these genera rest cannot logically be accepted as indicative of generic 
lines. For instance, the degree of filament development and glandu- 
losity is highly variable throughout the family. 

Dismissing the argument that no character in the family is con- 
stant which is true, for even the usually fundamental one of 2- and 
4-celled anthers must be qualified with exceptions evidently ten- 
dencies must rule in determining probable natural lines of develop- 
ment. One is faced with the fact that regularity of development 
of staminodia as foliaceous or reduced in series 4 suggests its 
reliability in delineating genera. In contrast, the variation of stami- 
nodia in the outer series within a group of admittedly related species 
seems to point to its lack of value as a generic character. If one 
does not reason thus as regards characters in the Lauraceae, that is, 
consider their relative or major validity in the family as a whole, one 
is soon forced to establish many new "genera" on negative char- 
acters. The result of the latter method is to lose in a multitude of 
generic names, all of which purport to have equal value, any com- 
prehensive view of the natural grouping of species within the family. 

Aniba sens, lat., as suggested, would strengthen the whole generic 
system of the family and form a group of no more variation than 



FLORA OF PERU 821 

Ocotea or Nectandra, and one even better contrasted with its nearest 
relative, Ajouea. Acrodiclidium is logically only a section of Aniba, 
with the 2 outer series of stamens modified or aborted, a character 
not of generic value, as shown clearly by its variability in Ajouea 
and elsewhere. Further, Endlicheria cannot be regarded as a group 
distinct from Aniba on the character of dioecious flowers, since both 
perfect and dioecious species exist in other genera, and some species 
may even be either (Ocotea minarum, for example). Other char- 
acters purporting to define Endlicheria exist in every degree of 
development in most if not all accepted genera. (But Kostermans 
has shown recently that there may be a partially constant fruit 
character and a generally constant difference in anther shape facts 
that strengthen the argument. It seems to me that only one genus 
is involved, composed of several fairly well marked groups of species.) 
The unreliability of the anther form as a generic character, at least 
here, is shown in Endlicheria anomala, whose second pair of anthers 
usually has the more circular shape that normally characterizes 
anthers of Acrodiclidium and Aniba. The form of the anthers else- 
where has not been regarded by Mez himself as alone significant in 
drawing generic lines. 

Urbanodendron Mez would not necessarily be included in Aniba 
sens. lat. because its position in the 2-celled anther series of genera 
is about analogous to that of Pleurothyrium in the 4-celled series. 
Urbanodendron could be maintained, although, except for its fila- 
ments and style, it is essentially the same as the Peruvian Endlicheria 
Sprucei. 

In accord with the above remarks, there may be found in the 
following synopsis of the Peruvian laurels a vegetative and technical 
key to Aniba, sens. lat. For convenience an artificial key has been 
attempted for all the species, disregarding generic lines, in hope that 
it may lead one to at least the better marked forms, even when 
flowers are lacking, but of course it requires herbarium material for 
comparison. 

Besides the native Lauraceae listed below, the European laurel, 
a beautiful, evergreen tree,Laurus nobilis L., is sometimes cultivated. 
Its crowded, coriaceous, lanceolate leaves are aromatic, dark green, 
and smooth, usually paler and the midrib reddish beneath; its inflo- 
rescences are short, few-flowered, and subtended by brown bracts 
that fall with the opening of the flowers, these 4-parted, the stami- 
nate usually with 10-12 stamens, the pistillate with 2-4 staminodia.

Although Kostermans' work is cited in so far as published at this 
writing, at the beginning of generic descriptions, I must take occa- 
sion to record here my deep indebtedness to him. He not only 
made available all his manuscripts before publication but had the 
kindness to make many suggestions and many insertions in my 
manuscript, which had already (for several years, based on Mez) 
been prepared.

scarcely or not at all distinct from the broad, conic style that is stig- 
matic laterally at the tip. Cryptocarya R. Br., by error on Dombey

mens Chilean, has slenderer, urceolate flowers, the ovary immersed 
and in fruit included in the ligneous perianth tube.

Like Beilschmiedia, but the perianth tube conspicuous and only 
the 2 outer series of stamens fertile, the 2 inner modified to stamino- 
dia, or rarely only 1 row, or less rarely the first 3 rows, fertile. Sta- 
minodia of series 4 foliaceous, rarely almost stipitiform. Cup 
usually little developed, borne on a thick, fleshy pedicel, the margin 
entire or with 6 large teeth. 

Ajouea tambillensis Mez, Jahrb. Bot. Gart. Berlin 5: 33. 1889.

Branchlets densely yellowish-tomentose, finally glabrous; petioles 
glabrous, 1-1.5 cm. long; leaves glabrous except for a few hairs on 
the midnerve beneath, coriaceous, elliptic or elliptic-lanceolate, acute 
at the base, shortly obtuse-acuminate or obtuse, 7-15 cm. long, 
3.5-6 cm. wide, the lateral nerves 6-12, scarcely prominent, the veins 
reticulate beneath; panicles axillary, pyramidal, many-flowered, gla- 
brous even to the flowers, these 2.5-3 mm. long, the equal sepals 
pilose within; outer 6 stamens pilose, the ovate anthers with a con- 
spicuous connective; staminodia to 1 mm. long, stipitate; ovary gla- 
brous, 1 mm. long, the style somewhat shorter . Ajouea rubra A. C. 
Smith, Phytologia 1: 115. 1935, of Amazonian Brazil, has broad peri- 
anth lobes, filiform staminodia, the leaves 4-6 cm. wide, and only the 
2 outer series of stamens fertile. Thus it resembles A . scandens Ducke, 
a vine, with long-petioled, broad leaves (Smith).

Resembling Aniba except that the flowers are dioecious, and, 
according to Kostermans, with differently shaped anthers and usually 
a shallow, fleshy fruit cup, the pedicel fleshy and enlarged. Third 
series of stamens rarely 4-celled. Style seldom as long as the usually 
glabrous ovary. It seems desirable at present to maintain these 
established groups, but it may be remarked that they may be shown 
eventually to constitute one genus, for the distinctions may be rela- 
tive. In Ocotea the flowers may be perfect or dioecious, and at least 
one species of Aniba has anthers resembling those of Endlicheria.

Glabrous except the cinereous-tomentulose branchlets of the 
inflorescence and the flowers; petioles 8-20 mm. long; blades sub- 
coriaceous, the 6-8 (-10) nerves and abundant reticulation more or 
less prominent beneath, elliptic, cuneate at the base, acute or obtuse 
at the apex, 13-20 cm. long, usually less than half as wide; pedicels 
1.5-2.5 mm. long; flowers 2.5-3 mm. long, 2.5 mm. wide, the broadly 
ovate outer segments scarcely 1 mm. long, the broader inner ones half 
longer; outer filaments fleshy, pilose, twice as long as the obtuse 
anthers, the inner filaments thrice as long; connective not protrud- 
ing, the anthers of the third series with suborbicular pores; basal 
glands large, sessile; style as long as the glabrous ovary. The Rio 
Acre tree was 12 meters high, the trunk 6 cm. in diameter (Krukoff). 
The species is said to be well known on the Rio Orinoco for its cinna- 
mon-flavored and scented bark. This is sometimes used for making 
a stimulating tea (Ducke). The species has been confused with 
Ocotea Quixos (Lam.) Kosterm., which has fruit cups with a broad, 
double margin.

its leaves become glabrous, as in Venezuelan specimens, the branches 
being more slender than usual, and the flowers slightly smaller.

Like Aniba, but usually only the third series of stamens fertile, 
rarely also the second, the latter mostly and the first always modi- 
fied into leafy staminodia, or these rarely lacking; fourth series of 
stamens usually aborted. Perianth tube sometimes obsolete. Style 
shorter than or subequaling the ovary. Cup usually double-mar- 
gined. Kostermans, op. cit. 754, segregates Phyllostemonodaphne 
Kosterm. to provide for a Brazilian species with only 1 row of 
stamens reduced to staminodia. Besides the following, Ducke, 
Archiv. Jard. Bot. Rio Janeiro 4: 187. 1925, has recorded L. Canella 
Kosterm. as one of the more common species on the upper Ama- 
zonian tributaries, where it is known as "casca preciosa." Its bark, 
with very agreeable aroma similar to that of cinnamon but milder, 
is used, powdered, to scent linen and sometimes as a stimulating tea. 

Leaves medium-sized, 10-20 cm. long; stamens of series 4 aborted. 
Leaves ovate-lanceolate, about 5 cm. wide, often narrower. 

Leaves narrowly long-acuminate, subobtuse at the base; flowers 
globose or urceolate, short.

The well known "palta" ("avocado" of the United States) is some- 
times cultivated. Its rather thin, glabrate, broadly elliptic leaves, 
the lateral nerves rugose-reticulate beneath, mostly 10-20 cm. long 
and half as wide, distinguish it from all native species except P. 
laevigata, which, however, has much less prominent nervation and 
a glabrous ovary. The palta is a large, beautiful tree. The fruits 
are known also as "aguacates."

8. OCOTEAAubl. 

Scarcely recognizable among the genera having 4-celled anthers, 
except as indicated in the key, many characters being shared with 
other genera; the flowers, most often dioecious, may be perfect, the 
perianth tube conspicuous or none, the lobes persistent or deciduous, 
the filaments longer or shorter than the anthers, or none, at least 
those of series 3 glandular. Ovary various, the style longer or shorter. 
Cup of the fruit simple or double-margined. The anther cells are 
placed as in Persea and Phoebe, with which groups it could most 
readily be united if the perhaps arbitrary acceptance of the develop- 
ment of staminodia as a generic character should be discarded. In 
the following descriptions the flowers may be understood to be dioe- 
cious unless otherwise stated. 0. balanocarpa and 0. Trianae, 
described from fruiting material, are omitted from the following 
keys; the latter may suggest 0. guyanensis.

more or less obovate, about 15 cm. long and 6 cm. wide, minutely 
sericeous above, the nerves sulcate-immersed, strigose beneath, the 
lateral nerves prominent; inflorescence, including the flowers, tomen- 
tulose, the flowers 6-7 mm. wide; anthers of series 1 and 2 subsessile, 
depressed-suborbicular, broader than long, papillose. The type

1-4 mm. long; depressed, suborbicular anthers much shorter than 
the filaments; glands of series 3 large. According to Kostermans, 
Fl. Suriname 2: 290. 1936, the HBK. tree is different and, if so, 
apparently the correct name for the following material is N. cuspi- 
data Nees, Syst. Laur. 330. 1836. The native Loreto name, "isula 
micuna," refers to the large ants that live on the tree. The bark is 
used as a poultice for the bites of ants (Tessmann). Neg. 35014.

Flowers perfect; perianth tube rarely well defined, the segments 
equal. Stamens of the 3 outer series fertile, the fourth always 
aborted. Filaments glabrous or papillose, all 9 basally glandular, 
the glands usually confluent. Upper anther cells introrse, the lower 
extrorse. Style usually conspicuous. Fruit apparently unknown. 
Doubtfully separable naturally from Ocotea, which may have, excep- 
tionally, all the filaments glandular, but in that genus the lower 
anther cells of the outer series are never exactly extrorse, nor is the 
androecium so compact by the fusion of the glands.

Reference: Fedde, Pflanzenfam. ed. 2. 17b: 5-145. 1936. 

Peruvian members of the family are of some economic impor-

oil, a clear, yellow oil extracted from the seeds, suitable for fuel and 
use as an ointment; in Peru (Hen era) as in Brazil this oil is used as 
a purge and for colic. Further, in Peru the flowers are employed as a 
narcotic, and the plant furnishes a yellow dye (Herrera).

Tall shrubs or small trees, simple or sparsely branched, the large 
leaves clustered at the ends of the branches; sap orange; flowers 
small, apetalous, in large, terminal panicles; ovary long-stipitate, 
with a single ovule; valves of the small fruit fleshy, opening from be- 
low upward; seeds surrounded by a large aril. From South America 
only one other species is known, B. pubibractea Hutchinson, for which

its author cites five collections from "Colombia." The type was 
collected by Pearce on slopes of the mountains about "Mufia," which 
I suspect is Mufia, Peru. However, I have seen no Peruvian material 
agreeing with the description. Pearce's labels usually bear no name 
of the country in which the specimens were collected, and since many 
of the localities are obscure, often it is difficult to refer them defi- 
nitely to any of the Andean countries.

79. CRUCIFERAE. Mustard Family 
Reference: Engl. & Prantl, Pflanzenfam. ed. 2. 17b: 227-658. 1936. 

Herbs, sometimes woody at the base in some of the alpine species, 
with watery, often acrid sap. Leaves alternate or basal, simple or 
pinnately divided. Flowers racemose or corymbose. Sepals 4, 
deciduous or persistent. Petals 4, hypogynous, nearly equal, usually 
narrowed at the base into a claw. Stamens 6, hypogynous, 2 shorter 
than the other 4. Pistil 1, composed of 2 united carpels. Fruit a 
silique or silicle, 1-2-celled, when 2-celled, the cells separated by a 
thin partition stretched between the 2 marginal placentae, from 
which the valves separate when ripe, sometimes indehiscent or 
separating into 1-seeded joints. In this flora, where simplicity in 
classification is sought, generic lines in the Cruciferae sometimes 
have been drawn less finely than by the most recent monographer. 
Nevertheless, the following key, as regards major details, is taken 
directly from his.

4. BRASSICAL. 

In this genus, which includes cabbage (col), mustard (mostaza), 
etc., several species are to be expected as weeds. They are all char- 
acterized by yellow flowers, hispid pubescence, or none, and slender 
pods tipped by a beaklike style. 

Brassica campestris L. Sp. PI. 666. 1753. 

Cauline leaves clasping; flowers exceeding the buds; pods erect, 
3.8-8 cm. long, with a conic beak one-third as long or longer. The 
related B. Napus L. (nabo) bears the opened flowers lower than the 
buds. Herrera lists as cultivated in Peru B. oleracea L., cabbage 
(col, or repollo), and its races, cauliflower (coliflor), and Brussels 
sprouts (colinabo).

5. RAPHANUS L. 

This well known genus scarcely needs description here, except 
to note that it is marked by its definitely biarticulate pods, the 
upper segment always fertile, and by its depressed-capitate stigma. 
In general, too, it may be known by its coarse, erect habit and 
rather showy, white or purplish flowers. 

Pods slender, to 4 mm. thick; petals white or purplish, with violet 
veins R. Raphanistrum. 

Pods stout, much thicker; petals often purplish, with yellowish or 
obscurely violet veins R. sativus. 

Raphanus Raphanistrum L. Sp. PI. 669. 1753. 

Annual; pods very fragile, 3.5-4 mm. thick, the beak 6-20 mm. 
long; ovules 4-11. There are many named forms, the following 
collection belonging to f. carneus (Schweigg. & Koerte) Thell. (var. 
purpurascens Dum.). In 1922 the plant colored purple the grain 
fields about Huanuco.

Reference: Thellung, Mitt. Bot. Mus. Zurich 28: 1-340. 1906. 
Annuals or perennials, sometimes suffruticose toward the base, 
the basal, rosulate leaves evanescent. Pubescence always simple. 
Leaves often pinnately parted, but various. Flowers white, in 
elongating racemes, sometimes showy, but often not, the petals 
even rudimentary. Glands 4-6. Pods laterally compressed, dehis- 
cent, the septum lanceolate to elliptic, emarginate and often more or 
less winged, ovate to orbicular. Nearly all species vary at times 
and are difficult to separate; the key does not presume to provide 
for all variations, but perhaps holds for many of them.

Draba alchemilloides Gilg, Bot. Jahrb. 42: 473. 1909; 143. 

A pulvinate perennial, the leaves densely rosulate at the tips 
of the branches; blades obovate-oblong, nearly rotund at the apex, 
gradually narrowed to the base, entire, 4-6 mm. long, about 3 mm. 
wide, white- tomentose with short, stellate hairs; flowers yellowish, 
in a capitate corymb; peduncle and pedicels (2-3 mm. long) densely 
stellate-pubescent; sepals oblong, rounded at the apex, stellate- 
pilose only outside, the clawed petals scarcely longer; pod ovoid, 
3-4 mm. long, 1.5-1.8 mm. wide, densely stellate- tomentose; style 
slender, 0.4-0.75 mm. long. According to the original description, 
the leaves are sometimes longer, the style very short and fleshy. 
The above diagnosis (as for all other species) is from 0. E. Schulz.

Draba alyssoides Humb. & Bonpl. ex DC. Syst. 2: 355. 
1821; 148. 

Stems ordinarily simple, 10-30 cm. high, more or less ligneous 
below and densely leafy, closely hirsute, even on the sepals, with 
spreading, simple trichomes to 1 mm. long and shorter, stipitate, 
furcate ones; leaves entire or with 1-2 teeth on each side, narrowed 
to the base, sessile, the midnerve strongly thickened at the base, 
7-12 mm. long, with stiff, simple trichomes on both sides, beneath 
also with shorter, stellate ones; racemes elongating, to 30-flowered, 
bracteate below; pedicels to 10 mm. long; sepals 4 mm. long, not 
saccate, rounded at the apex, broadly oblong-elliptic, the inner 
slightly larger; petals white, sparsely veined, 7 mm. long, emarginate; 
filaments somewhat dilated at the base; ovules 16-24; style 1-4 
mm. long; pods 8-11 mm. long, 4-5 mm. wide, hirsute with mostly 
simple (a few bifurcate) hairs; seeds brown, 1.2-1.5 mm. long. 
Var. thlaspiformis (Gilg & Brandt) 0. E. Schulz, 150, is smaller, 
branching, the 12-ovulate pods shorter and narrower. The species 
is typical of a group of closely related species, or varieties (?), and is 
therefore no doubt in Peru in one form or another. D. Hemsleyana 
Gilg, 150, is similar, but the pods are glabrous, about 10 mm. long, 
2 mm. wide, the style 2 mm. long; D. splendens Gilg, 150, also has 
narrow pods, but these, like the leaves on both sides, have simple 
pubescence; both are Ecuadorean. Neg. 13895.

Sepals erect, spreading, the lateral ones sometimes cucullate at the 
base. Petals sessile, obovate. Nectar glands usually all present, 
the stamens 6, the oblong anthers sagittate at the base. Pod linear, 
attenuate into the often filiform style, the more or less bilobate 
stigma minute. Compare under Sisymbrium the cordate-leaved 
perennial, Ivania, if sought here. Species plastic, apparently not 
stabilized. 

Racemes usually more or less bracted; pods 1.3-3 cm. long; flowers

The berro or watercress that may be said to typify this group 
is cosmopolitan in distribution and in popularity as a salad plant, 
particularly in Latin countries like Peru. Herrera has recorded 
local Peruvian names as "mostacilla," "mayu-mostaza," "chicchi," 
"chijchi," and "occoruro." Botanists have at one time or another 
given it more than twice as many scientific designations; see Sprague, 
Journ. Bot. 62: 225-228. 1924; but now, according to the Inter- 
national Rules, only two are to be regarded as legally correct, 
Rorippa Nasturtium-aquaticum (L.) Hayek, and Nasturtium offi- 
cinale R. Br., the latter name being conserved for those who restrict 
the genus Nasturtium to the watercress; see Marie- Victorin, Contr. 
Bot. Univ. Montreal 17: 17. 1930. In Rorippa I include Kardamo- 
glyphos, notwithstanding the lack of nectar glands, for the degree 
of development of these within the group is variable. Admittedly 
the character is important in classification of the family elsewhere. 

Petals white, conspicuous, well exceeding the sepals; medial nectar 
glands wanting R. Nasturtium-aquaticum. 

Petals slightly if at all longer than the sepals, or yellow, sometimes 

none. 

Stems leafy, ascending to erect; seeds in 2 rows. 
Annuals or short-lived plants with ample leaves or leaflets; 

nectar glands present. 
Leaves pinnate, the leaflets remote, narrow . . . R. bonariensis. 

Leaves lyrate-pinnate, the terminal leaflet much larger than 
the lateral ones R. clandestina. 

Leaves obovate, only the basal ones pinnate R. Sinapis. 

Perennials, depressed-ascending, the leaflets small; nectar 

glands none R. nana. 

Stems nearly leafless, creeping; seeds in 1 row R. sarmentosa.

Lobularia Desv. 

The well known garden plant, sweet alyssum or "espumilla," is 
often cultivated. It is surprising to find this plant maintained by 
Schulz as a generic type on the basis of a nectar gland character, a 
character which he himself has discounted in the case of Rorippa 
and which Briquet showed to be of no value here as a generic criterion.

cels that elongate in fruit. Sepals more or less persistent, nearly 
as long as the greenish yellow, white, or purplish petals. Nectar 
glands confluent, the medial reduced or wanting. Style and ovary 
subequal. Style short or nearly obsolete. Stigma depressed. Pods 
short-oblong, the septum complete. Illustrated, Weberbauer 198. 
The genus Brayopsis differs in no fundamental respect except 
that the medial nectar glands are wanting, a variation paralleled 
in Nasturtium and Eudema. 

Leaves and ovary glabrous, or the leaves sparsely pilose. 

Petals and sepals subequal, about 4 mm. long E. calycina.

north Chilean Ivania 0. E. Schulz, Repert. Sp. Nov. 33: 188. 1933, 
with entire, cordate leaves, short, dense racemes, and stipitate 
ovary. In addition to the following, there is a specimen in Herb. 
Madrid, Isern 2115, from Camino de Palca, Dept. Junin, apparently 
new, but which is so exceptional in character that I have not wished 
to give it a name now. Dr. Charles Baehni has kindly studied it 
and determined that the primary root is lateral. It is an almost 
perfect match for the North American Thelypodium lasiophyllum 
(Hook. & Arn.) Greene in general aspect, but the pods are not 
recurved and the primary root is clearly lateral. It may be described 
as follows: 

Slender, apparently annual or biennial, to at least 30 cm. high, 
the terete stems below and the leaves sparsely hispidulous with 
spreading, simple hairs or with an occasional furcate one; lower 
leaves unknown; middle cauline leaves oblong, pinnate-lobed or 
dentate, to 10 cm. long and 3 cm. wide, mostly somewhat shorter 
and about 1.5 cm. wide, long-attenuate to the petiolate base, the 
lobes acute, to 2 mm. wide, oblong-linear, remote, about 4 on each 
side of the oblong-linear portion of the leaf; uppermost leaves den- 
ticulate, linear; racemes ebracteate; pedicels glabrous or sparsely 
hispidulous, divaricate-ascending, 5 mm. long; pods 1-nerved, 
arcuate-ascending, torulose, 4 cm. long, 0.75 mm. wide; style 1 mm. 
long, the stigma depressed-capitate, not lobed; septum nerveless; 
seeds not mucilaginous when wet; petals pale, filiform-clawed, about 
4 mm. long; anthers blunt; style short, thick, the stigma depressed, 
not obviously if at all lobed. Neg. 34289.

Plants bluish green but more or less pubescent, even to the ovary, 
with simple hairs, becoming bushy-branched and ligneous below; 
leaves linear, entire, fleshy; racemes 20-40-flowered, the yellow 
(fading to reddish) petals 7 mm. long, twice as long as the sepals; 
pedicels 3-6 mm. long, more or less recurving, contorted in fruit; 
pods slender, the middle nerve not prominent, the style 1 mm. long, 
the stigma bilobed; ovules 16-32; seeds in 1 row. The similar 
Polypsecadium Harmsianum (Muschl.) 0. E. Schulz, of Bolivia, has 
longer, many-seeded pods, the entire leaves lanceolate. Technically 
closely related but probably a convenient segregate is Werdermannia 
pinnata (Barne"oud) 0. E. Schulz (S. pinnatum Barn.), with finely 
pinnate leaves, the leaflets divaricate, and strict racemes of whitish

Similar to the last preceding species but with a fine, crisped pu- 
bescence mixed with longer, spreading hairs, and distinguished from 
G. Ulei by the pubescence and the caudate-acuminate sepals, longer 
than the pink petals. The glabrous or minutely granular-glandular,

dant, soft, spreading, glandular indument, but not clearly distinct 
from G. densiflora Benth., which typically is more hirsute. As sug- 
gested by Briquet, op. cit. 388, these three species may be forms of 
a single variable one. Negs. 1184, 5818.

and pubescens, with 3-5-foliolate leaves. One of the type sheets 
(Paris) of the glabrate plant is labeled "Cheuchin," and the mature 
pods and stipes are equal in length, about 2 cm. long; the single speci- 
men of the more viscid-pubescent variety has pods 2.5-3 cm. long, 
equaled by the stipe, and purports to come from Chile, although the 
locality "Cheuchin" has been written on the label; none of the mate-

Cleome glandulosa R. & P. ex DC. Prodr. 1: 238. 1824. 

A shrub or small tree with very glandular-hispid branches, leaves, 
and capsules; leaves 7-9-foliolate, the leaflets ovate-lanceolate; 
sepals narrowly ovate-lanceolate, about half as long as the petals, 
these becoming 2 cm. long; pedicels 1.5 cm. long; capsule and stipe 
each 4-5 cm. long.- My specimens were from small trees with 
smooth trunks about 1.5 meters high and short crowns of few, very 
leafy branches. The abundant, yellow glands of foliage and branches 
were pungently and disagreeably scented. The Quechua name 
seemed to be "ancas tucapinq." C. Jamesonii Briq., of Ecuador, 
has narrowly lanceolate leaflets and slender stipes more than twice 
as long as the pods. Weberbauer 3203 from Ancash is similar to 
C. glandulosa but the pubescence is almost tomentose and the cap- 
sules are glabrous. It is indicated in herb. Berlin as a new species.

Cleome hirsuticaulis Macbr. Candollea 5: 360. 1934. 

An erect, strict, unarmed shrub, 2.5-3 meters high; stems and 
pedicels densely glandular-pubescent with firm, spreading hairs; 
leaflets oblong-lanceolate or oblong-elliptic, almost caudate-acumi- 
nate, cuneate at the base, to 14 cm. long, 4 cm. wide, very thin, 
sparsely hirsutulous above, glabrous beneath except on the costa; 
pedicels 4-6 cm. long, about equaled by the stipes; capsule 14-17 
cm. long, to 8 mm. in diameter, narrowly fusiform, attenuate at 
the apex, short-pilose; style 3 mm. long.

Cleome Lechleri Eichl. in Mart. Fl. Bras. 13, pt. 1: 250. 1865. 

A viscid, glandular-tomentose plant, related to C. glandulosa, 
but with oblong or ovate-lanceolate sepals one-half to two-thirds 
as long as the petals; bracts rotund; capsules and stipes subequal, 
or the latter longer than the pedicels, sparsely glandular-setulose 
or glabrous. The pubescence is more viscid than glandular. C. 
ecuadorica Heilborn and C. chrysogyna Gilg, also Ecuadorean, 
apparently too near C. Lechleri, have glabrous pods, those of the 
former 3 times as long as broad, exceeded by the stipe; of the latter 
5 times as long as broad, and nearly as long as the stipe. The 
Weberbauer collections 4909 and 5652 are annotated by Gilg in 
herb. Berlin as new, a disposition apparently vouched for by Heil- 
born, but he does not supply descriptions nor distinguish them in 
his key. The presence or absence of glands, unless supported by 
other characters, is open to question as a specific character. Neg.

Cleome monochroma Macbr. Field Mus. Bot. 4: 169. 1929. 

A slender, subherbaceous annual or biennial several decimeters 
tall, with large, 7-foliolate, sparsely pubescent leaves, villous and 
glandular, greenish white flowers 3.5-4 cm. long (the nearly linear 
sepals and petals of the same color), and long-acuminate capsules 
10-14 cm. long, nearly 1 cm. wide at base, borne on glabrous stipes 
and pedicels about half as long; leaflets sessile, attenuate at each 
end, softly subappressed-strigillose on both sides. Probably C. 
gigantea L. as to Peru, but perhaps with C. Kerberi Briq. and 
C. amazonica Heilborn races of one species; but the Mexican plant is 
less pubescent, the style on the ripe pod 1 cm. long or longer, the 
stipes pubescent; and the Linnean plant has a sessile stigma. Pax 
and Hoffmann list C. monochroma among the Herbaceae, apparently 
overlooking my own reduction of it at one time to C. gigantea.

further difference in the white-verruculose markings of the branch- 
lets, a character that seems to be highly variable. The widely dis- 
tributed C. Tapia L. is with difficulty, if at all, distinguishable from 
the two preceding species by its more strictly perfect flowers with 
fewer stamens, these only twice as long as the petals; fruit ovoid. It

1936. 

A well marked family, consisting of one genus, related to the Cap- 
paridaceae, but the flower parts usually 8, the ovary incompletely 
(usually) 6-celled, the fruit a green berry, the aspect similar to that 
of certain Phytolaccaceae, to which group Bentham and Hooker 
referred it. 

1. TOVARIA R. & P. 

Slender, sparsely and virgately branched, green-barked shrubs, 
often flowering as annuals. Leaves alternate, trifoliolate, glabrous. 
Stipules minute, triangular. Racemes terminal, elongating, lax. 
Filaments dilated toward the base. Flowers perfect. 

Tovaria pendula R. & P. Syst. Veg. 85. 1798; Fl. Peruv. 3: 73. 
pi. 306. 1802. 

Leaflets lanceolate, acuminate, often 8 cm. long and chiefly 
2-3 cm. wide; racemes drooping, the laxly disposed, pale yellowish 
green or greenish white flowers about 7 mm. broad; petals obtuse, 
exceeding the acute sepals, about 4 mm. long; stamens exserted. 
According to Weberbauer, in Peru at middle elevations on the eastern 
ranges. The plant, both growing and in the herbarium, has a strong

and characteristic odor which has been variously described as that of 
Apium graveolens, Cestrum, and cumarin. In the field it recalled to 
me the odor of preparations used as supplementary foods for stock, 
but the reason was not obvious until Dr. Charles Baehni identified 
it as that of species of Trigonella. Illustrated, Pflanzenfam. op. cit. 225.

Reference: Engler, Pflanzenfam. ed. 2. 18a: 3-68. 1930. 

These aquatic plants that usually grow attached to rocks in swift 
streams, often in waterfalls, probably are more numerous in Peru 
than is indicated below, because few collectors find them. Resem- 
bling algae or mosses in general appearance, they are readily recog- 
nized. The small flowers consist of 3-5 free, or more or less united 
sepals, or these may be reduced to scales. The stamens are one to 
several, and then whorled, the anthers usually introrse, 4-celled. 
Ovary 2-3-celled, free, with a thick, central placenta. Capsule usu- 
ally septicidal, many-seeded. 

1. APINAGIA Tul. 

Plants thalloid, or floating and with fibrous roots. Flowers borne 
in a dichotomous or sickle-like inflorescence. Stamens usually 2-4, 
free or united.

Small, branched, somewhat succulent herbs with minute, solitary, 
axillary, pedicellate flowers. Commonly many plants grow laxly 
matted together, in loose or sandy soils and often under shrubs, 
especially in the loma regions (Weberbauer, 145). 

Flowers few and segregated on long, slender pedicels much exceed- 
ing the subtending leaves; carpels 10-15-seeded . .C. Macbridei.

This new species is placed in Crassula following Berger's treat- 
ment of the family. In general appearance it resembles the South 
African Crassula expansa Ait., from which it differs in having the 
petals shorter than the sepals, in the diminutive stems, and in the 
4-merous flowers. It is related to the South American Crassula pedun- 
cularis (Smith) Schonl. (Tillaea peduncularis Smith) of Uruguay and 
Argentina, from which it differs in its larger flowers, oblanceolate 
instead of linear-lanceolate leaves, forking branches, and more numer- 
ously seeded carpels. 

With 4-merous sepals and petals it seems properly to belong to 
the section Vaillantii Schonl. as treated in Berger's evaluation of 
the family, although in its 10-15-seeded carpels it diverges from 
this section. 

2. VILLADIA Rose 

Altamiranoa Rose. 

Reference: Berger in Engl. & Prantl, Pflanzenfam. ed. 2. 18a:

Small-leaved perennials with small flowers, and therefore with 
the aspect and habit of Sedum, but resembling Echeveria in having 
the flower parts constantly 5 and the petals to a greater or less 
degree united into a tube. In the Peruvian species the inflorescence 
is presumably always one-sided, on which basis the generic name 
Altamiranoa has been proposed, but the inflorescence in Echeveria 
is variable. 

Petals shorter than or subequaling the sepals, greenish .V. Dyvrandae. 
Petals distinctly longer than the sepals.

84. SAXIFRAGACEAE. Saxifrage Family 

A small rock saxifrage, several hydrangeas, and a number of 
species of wild currants, some with beautiful, elongate racemes of 
roseate flowers, are elements of this family or group of families 
as it occurs in Peru, that seem pleasantly familiar to a botanist com- 
ing from the north. Novelties to him will be the Escallonias, and the 
curious Phyllonomas with their short inflorescences of small flowers 
arising directly from the midnerve of the leaf. Such a diversity in 
character in one family has naturally suggested to a number of botan- 
ists notably Hutchinson, Families of Flowering Plants 1 : 120. 1926 
their disposition as separate families, but here Engler's at least con- 
venient arrangement in one family is followed, and acknowledgment 
is made of the use of his work: Pflanzenfam. ed. 2. 18a: 74-226. 1928 
(1930).

1. SAXIFRAGA L. Saxifrage 

Reference: Engler & Irmscher, Pflanzenreich IV. 117: 378-382. 
1916. 

This large genus, of wide distribution, is represented in the high 
Andes of Peru by only one polymorphic species. It is common on 
rocks between, according to Weberbauer, 2,800 and 4,500 meters, 
but is mentioned by Ruiz and Pavon in their journal only once, when 
they found it above Tarma and noted the common names "puchup- 
pus" and "siempreviva." 

Saxifraga magellanica Poir. in Lam. Encycl. 6: 686. 1804; 378. 
S. cordillerarum Presl, Rel. Haenk. 2: 55. 1831. 

Compactly cespitose, more or less densely glandular-pilose, the 
subligneous or herbaceous stems 1-5 cm. long, often columnar in 
form because clothed by the imbricate, dead leaves; scapes 1-10 cm. 
high, 1-several-flowered; leaves 5-8 cm. long, 3-5-lobed or bifid, the 
cauline ones sessile, cuneate, mostly 3-lobed; sepals ovate, obtuse, 
shorter than the subcampanulate receptacle, the 3-nerved petals 
2-3 times as long; stamens scarcely equaling the sepals; capsule 
ovoid, truncate. The typical form, with petals not more than 3 mm. 
long, is confined to the antarctic region. This the monographers have 
designated subsp. Poiretii; the Andean form, with petals as much as 
9 mm. long, subsp. peruviana, dividing this into three varieties and 
many forms. Since these smaller divisions are of doubtful taxonomic 
significance, there being no proof that they are more than ecological 
states, they may most practically be treated as constituting one vari- 
able variety, this weak, but separated geographically. Illustrated

Reference: E. de Janczewski, Me"m. Soc. Phys. Hist. Nat. Geneve

Various species of wild currants grow in Peru at 2,800-4,500 
meters, generally along brooks at lower altitudes, in rock crevices 
at higher elevations (Weberbauer). There they are often gnarled 
shrubs half concealed by the protecting rocks, half prostrate in slides, 
or deformed and stunted, suggesting a precarious existence. When 
the species are better known, the number recognized will probably 
be fewer. 

Racemes, at least the staminate, mostly (3-) 4 to many centimeters 

long, often pendent. 

Flowers, at least the staminate, campanulate-turbinate (cf. R. 
albifolium~) ; petals more or less conchiform, except in R. elegans.

3306, type. 

Ribes hirticaule Macbr. Field Mus. Bot. 8: 115. 1930. 

Stems long-rusty-hirsute, scarcely glandular, with minute, white 
hairs intermixed; stipules conspicuous, long-ciliate, about 1 cm. long; 
petioles to 4 cm. long; blades cordate-ovate, 3-lobed and irregularly 
serrate, mostly about 10 cm. long and slightly wider, glabrate above 
or sparsely pubescent with minute, white hairs and a few longer, 
rusty ones, paler beneath and cinereous-pubescent, especially on the 
nerves, the lobes acute or subacuminate; racemes 10-15 cm. long, 
conspicuously bracted; pedicels 3-5 mm. long; bractlets about 3 mm. 
long; flowers fiery red, like the pedicels cinereous-pubescent, 5-6 mm. 
long, tubular-campanulate; sepals acute; petals oblong, 1 mm. long, 
in the pistillate flower, inserted with and equaling the stamens; ovary 
densely glandular-hirsute. Perhaps only an extraordinarily reddish- 
hirsute variety of R. macrobotrys, but it lacks the stipitate glands, 
and the petals are larger.

Ribes praecox Macbr. Field Mus. Bot. 8: 116. 1930. 

Branches tortuous, obscurely pulverulent, finally glabrous and 
lustrous; leaves few, appearing with the flowers, more or less densely 
glandular with yellow, sessile glands, especially beneath, there also 
minutely puberulent, rugulose-reticulate above, denticulate, more

by the pedicels, the bractlets 1 mm. long; flowers greenish 
yellow, short-campanulate, 3-3.5 mm. long, the sepals strongly 
reflexed; petals distinctly obovate, 1.5 mm. long, equaled by the 
equally inserted stamens (staminate flowers). R. Weddellianum 
Jancz., 402, of Ecuador, similar to this and R. brachybotrys, has 
eglandular leaves.

Younger branches lustrous, at first sparsely stipitate-glandular; 
petioles and rachis densely stipitate-glandular and puberulent, the 
petioles 2-4 cm. long, the rachis 5-8 cm. long, laxly flowered; blades 
rotund-cordate, about 4 cm. wide and long or larger, distinctly 3- 
lobed or rarely with 2 additional, obscurely developed, spreading 
lobes near the base, doubly serrulate, the secondary teeth fine, 
sparsely glandular above, soon glabrous, beneath paler, asperulous, 
especially on the 3 principal nerves and rather prominent veins; 
racemes pendent, the yellowish flowers soon recurving on the elon- 
gating pedicels, these finally about equaled by the glandular-dentate 
bractlets, those 5-6 mm. long; ovary sparsely stipitate-glandular; 
calyx slightly pilose, 4 mm. long; stamens and obovate-roundish 
petals subequal. Description from the type of R. Dombeyanum. R. 
andicolum Jancz., 411, widely distributed north of Peru, if sought 
here, is mentioned under R. bolivianum. No specimen of R. viscosum 
R. & P. was found at Madrid. Spach interpreted the Dombey mate- 
rial at Paris, from the type locality, Tarma, as viscosum, which he 
cited in synonymy and wrote the name on the sheet. In spite of the 
fact that R. viscosum is described as having 5-lobed, strongly veined 
leaves, it seems probable that it is mature material of R. glandulosum. 
Ruiz and Pavon described the fruit as small and purplish, and stated 
that R. glandulosum came from Tarma. The Madrid sheet of R. 
glandulosum purports to be from "Chili," but, as Janczewski remarks, 
it has not been found there since. Its racemes are as much as 5 cm. 
long; leaves obscurely 3-lobed; petioles stipitate-glandular; branch- 
lets glabrate. Neg. 27344.

Ribes Weberbaueri Jancz. Bull. Acad. Cracov. 763. 1905; 435. 

Branches glandular-setose; blades 3-5-divided, deeply dentate, 
glandular-setulose, only 1.5 cm. long and broad, cordate at the base; 
petioles 1 cm. long; pistillate racemes pendent, 4-5 cm. long, lax, 
glandular-pubescent; bracts persistent, ovate-lanceolate, 6 mm. 
long; pedicels 1-2 mm. long; bractlets 1-1.5 mm. long; flowers 
tubular, reddish, glandular; petals narrowly obovate, inserted above 
the subsessile, nectariferous anthers; berry red, glandular-hispid.

3. ESCALLONIA Mutis 
Stereoxylon R. & P. 

Flowers 5-parted; ovary 2-3-celled, with 4-6 parietal placentae; 
style 1; capsule completely septicidal. Shrubs and trees of some 
local importance, especially E. pendula and the "chachacoma," E. 
resinosa, commonly planted even to an altitude of 3,400 meters 
(Weberbauer). The red heartwood yields a crimson and violet dye 
(Ruiz & Pawn); the trunks are used for fuel (Hen era}. The latter 
authority records that the tree is attacked by the larva of a lepi- 
dopterous insect called "huaittampu," which is eaten toasted and is 
sold in the markets of Cuzco. Ruiz and Pavon wrote the native 
name as above, but others have varied the vowels, notably as "cha- 
chacuma." Beside the following, E. pulverulenta (R. & P.) Pers., 
Chilean, marked by a parted style with reniform stigmas, has been 
recorded, probably in error; cf. E. pendula. 

Flowers few to many, terminal. 
Flowers racemose. 

Racemes 2-4-flowered E. salicifolia. 

Racemes several-many-flowered. 

Flowers about 6 mm. long, or longer; filaments elongate.

Escallonia angustifolia Presl, Rel. Haenk. 2: 47. 1831. 

Young branches spreading, angled, covered by exuding resin; 
leaves subcoriaceous, glabrous, concolorous, glandular-punctate, 
reticulate-veined, linear-lanceolate, obtuse, callous-serrulate, nar- 
rowed at the base to the short, glandular petiole, 4-6 cm. long, 7 
mm. wide; panicle compound, many-flowered, little longer than the 
leaves; pedicels spreading, angulate, glabrous; capsule nodding, ovoid, 
glabrous, tipped by the elongate style, the stigma capitate-peltate.

A tree 10-12 meters high, with conspicuously exfoliating branches, 
the branchlets granular- tomentose; leaves lanceolate, cuneate at each 
end, acute, minutely and densely denticulate, glabrate or glabrous, 
sessile or subsessile, to about 10 cm. long, 2.5 cm. wide; racemes pend-

3-5 mm. long; pedicels 4 mm. long; calyx lobes triangular, acute, 
scarcely 2 mm. long; petals erect, oblong, 3 mm. long, equaled by 
the style, this with a peltate stigma; anthers nearly 2.5 mm. long, 
much exceeding the nearly obsolete filaments. Aberrant in the 
genus by reason of the reduced filaments, but, as Dr. Jose" Cuatre- 
casas has suggested to me, perhaps a heterostylous form of E. pendula.

A compact, densely branched, spreading shrub or small tree, the 
branchlets many, appressed-ascending, little tortuous, exfoliating 
and scarred below the tips; leaves subentire or obscurely denticulate, 
glabrous, lustrous, evenose above, dull and paler beneath, somewhat 
petiolate by the cuneate base, acutish, elliptic or slightly obovate, 
5-8 mm. long, 3-4 mm. wide; pedicels 2 mm. long; receptacle sub-

1028 FIELD MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BOTANY, VOL. XIII 

Apparently similar to E. piurensis, having a high-conic floral 
disk, but the leaves larger, serrate, thick-veined, paler beneath; 
corymbs hirsute; bractlets ovate; calyx teeth minute; capsule tur- 
binate, truncate. Type not seen. The Weberbauer specimen has 
leaves minutely serrulate, about 5 cm. long, 1.5 cm. wide, the close 
panicles puberulent only, but densely sessile-tuberculate-glandular, 
like the calyces. Since the plates of this genus in the Flora Peruviana 
are poor, this collection may possibly represent the Ruiz and Pavon 
species. The disk is distinctly conic.

Similar to E. pendula, but at once distinguished by the dense 
and long pubescence of reddish, gland-tipped hairs on the younger 
branches; also the lower peduncles are 2-4- rather than 1-flowered. 
As in E. pendula R. & P., the receptacle is free above and cup-

very short. Type referred by Engler (in herb.) to E. resinosa, and 
the differences not apparent, but Mattfeld, Notizbl. Bot. Gart. Ber-

Glabrous, with spreading, tortuous, flexuous branchlets; leaves 
coriaceous, dull above or slightly lustrous, the veins faint, mostly 
12 mm. long, 6 mm. wide, obovate-cuneate, acutish-crenate-serru- 
late, with sessile glands in the serrations; calyx lobes glabrous, short- 
glandular, triangular-acute, 3 or 4 times shorter than the linear- 
spatulate petals and the calyx, the tube hemispheric. Seems to be 
referable to E. myrtilloides, or a variety of it. The type at Paris 
is sterile; it is more openly branched than E. corymbosa (as to type), 
with larger leaves, but lacks the numerous small branchlets, the 
leafless branches being very tortuous.

4. HYDRANGEA L. 

Cornidia R. & P.; Sarcostyles Presl. 

Reference: Briquet, Ann. Cons. Jard. Bot. Geneve 20: 393-417. 
1919. 

Only two species of the Hydrangeas described here have, in part, 
petaloid flowers, H . peruviana and H. Weberbaueri, the former dis- 
tinct by the coherence of its petals, the latter by its wine-red, peta- 
loid sepals. H. peruviana, in spite of its name, is apparently known 
only from Ecuador, where collected by Tafalla. Both these species, 
as well as H. Jelskii, are slender-stemmed, scandent shrubs of the 
montana zone, and it is questionable whether the other species 
described as trees are described correctly. With the exception of H. 
tarapotensis and H. Jelskii with 1-3 usually coherent, subulate 
styles, the following species have the styles thickened in age and 
3-4 in number, except those species with petaloid flowers, which 
have only 2 thickened styles. The petals are 4, the stamens 8. Bri- 
quet, Compte Rendu Soc. Phys. Hist. Nat. Geneve 36: 38-43. 1919, 
valued these differences properly as sectional in character, relegating 
Cornidia, still maintained by some students, to synonymy. But his 
species concepts, with more collections, will probably prove to have 
been too finely drawn. Besides the species listed here, Hydrangea 
opuloides Koch, called "hortensia," a native of China and Japan, 
often is planted for ornament, on account of its showy, white, pink, 
or blue flowers.

least, opposite or whorled, and in this respect differing usually from 
the closely related Saxifragaceae. Some have regarded Brunellia as 
constituting a distinct family, but it is nearer to Weinmannia than 
to any other group, and therefore, from a practical standpoint, 
the genera should be associated under one family name.

genus is well illustrated (mostly after Humboldt and Bonpland) in

127. 1798, omitted, is, according to Pilger on the type sheet at 
Madrid, an unknown species of Fagara. The genus needs careful 
revision. Some of the Bolivian species may be the same as Peruvian

Brunellia dichapetaloides Macbr. Candollea 5: 361. 1934. 

Branchlets soon glabrous and lustrous; inflorescence and leaves 
beneath, with the rachis, more or less densely and shortly ashy- 
brown-pilose; petioles 6 cm. long; leaves 5-6-foliolate, 20-25 cm. 
long; leaflets oblong-elliptic, oblique at the base, acute or acuminate, 
subequal, 10-15 cm. long, 3.5-4 cm. wide, obscurely crenate-dentate, 
glabrous and very lustrous above; inflorescence many-flowered, 10 
cm. long and about a third broader, the peduncle 2 cm. long, the 
3 principal branches 3-4 cm. long; flowers crowded on pedicels 
1.5 mm. long, sordid-puberulent; sepals 4, broadly oblong, acutish, 
2 mm. long; stamens exserted, glabrous except at the base; anthers 
red-puncticulate; follicles 4, pilose. B. Brittonii Rusby, Bolivian, 
has leaflets 4.5-6 cm. wide, sepals 6 mm. long, the filaments exserted. 
B. Oliveri (see also under B. Weberbaueri) differs from B. dichapeta- 
loides in its pilose-hirsute branches and obtuse leaves. Nearer the 
latter is B. comocladifolia Humb. & Bonpl., Colombian (not Peru 
as in Index Kew.), with serrulate leaflets, and B. Funckiana Tul., 
similar, but the leaflets acute at the base. B. propinqua HBK., 
reported as Peruvian, is, fide Tulasne, Colombian; it, as to type, 
has smaller leaflets than these other species, 3-4 pairs, obtuse or 
acutish, shorter than 10 cm., and a densely rusty-tomentose inflores- 
cence, the peduncle longer than 5 cm. It is not clear that the 
Peruvian species can be distinguished from B. comocladifolia.

heavily reticulate-veined beneath, obscurely denticulate. Appar- 
ently too similar to B. tomentosa and from the same country is B. 
Stuebelii Hieron., the branchlets quadrangular, the leaves barely 
acute, opposite, 12-14 cm. long, 3.5-4 cm. wide. Well marked is

These shrubs or small trees, with small flowers, most often 
borne in fascicles on an elongate axis (the inflorescence is here, for 
convenience, called a raceme) exist in a great number of species, 
separated on characters often so slight that they might be described 
as casual. The genus is distinct enough in its flower parts, these 
4 (-5), the anthers 2-lobed, the ovary 2 (-3) -celled, the seeds pubes- 
cent. Kuntze adopted the name Windmannia P. Br., making some 
new combinations under it. I regret that Dr. Jose" Cuatrecasas was 
unable to prepare the account of the Peruvian species, as had been 
planned in connection with his monograph of the genus. My ten- 
tative key and notes, with studies we had made jointly at Madrid, 
have served as the basis for the following treatment. Several 
Andean species not as yet known from Peru have been included, 
especially when they have been misinterpreted or imperfectly 
known. Intentionally omitted areW. intermedia Cham. & Schlecht., 
Mexican, and W. trichosperma Cav., Chilean. The first was credited 
to Peru by Pampanini on the basis of a "Pavon" specimen in herb. 
Boissier, labeled "Peru," but, as is well known, there are a number 
of specimens in that herbarium so labeled whose origin evidently 
is Mexican. Besides, I have not identified (having found no speci- 
mens at Madrid or elsewhere so named) W. corymbosa R. & P. Fl. 
Peruv. 4: pi. 330, 1802, and W. dentata R. & P. op. cit. pi. 334. As 
in the Lauraceae, I have accepted volume four of the Ruiz and 
Pavon work as published, because the species are nearly all identi- 
fiable with the authors' own specimens. Unfortunately, in preparing 
this account in its present form, volume four has not been available.

There is a conflict between the names of D. Don. and Moricand 
(both 1830), and they have been used in accord with the biblio-

86. ROSACEAE. Rose Family 

Although roses are not native in Peru, the family is represented 
by a number of trees and shrubs familiar to North Americans and 
Europeans, such as choke cherries (Prunus) and blackberries (Rubus). 
Several almost cosmopolitan genera are meagerly, if at all, repre- 
sented, like the strawberry (Fragaria), cinquefoil (Potentilla), and 
hawthorn (Crataegus) . There are a number of conspicuous and inter- 
esting plants of the family, notably the beautiful quinuares (Poly- 
lepis), several of which are of economic value, and the curious and 
useful lloque (Kageneckia). In cultivation to a greater or less 
extent are such widely known fruits as the goma de pais or apricot, 
Armeniaca vulgaris L.; the durazno, abidor, melocotonero, or peach, 
Persica vulgaris L.; the almendro or almond, Amygdalus communis 
L.; plums, ciruelas, Prunus domestica L.; peral or pear, Pyrus com- 
munis L.; manzano or apple, Mains communis DC.; and membrillo 
or quince, Cydonia vulgaris Pers. The cultivated roses include R. 
centifolia L. and R. indica L. According to Herrera, all these species 
are found in the Department of Cuzco and most of them, at least, 
in the more central and northern inter-Andean valleys also. 

Fruit an apple-like drupe; calyx tube and ovary adnate; leaves 

simple; flowers corymbose 1. Hesperomeles. 

Fruit not apple-like, sometimes plumlike, berry-like, or dry and 

carpellate (achenes).

Reference: Koehne, Bot. Jahrb. 52: 279-333. 1915. 

This well known genus is characterized chiefly by its free calyx 
tube, which does not crown the drupaceous fruit. The stamens in 
the Peruvian species are often more than 20. The cherry, commonly 
grown for food knd for ornament near Chosica, Cuzco, and many 
other places in the mountain valleys is P. Capuli Cav., originally 
of Mexico. When the genus is sufficiently known, the total number 
of Peruvian species probably will be materially reduced.

Trees, notable for their leafless, tortuous branchlets, the alternate, 
3-foliolate or unequally pinnate leaves crowded at their tips. Petioles 
imbricate at the broad, membranous, vaginate base. Racemes 
slender, loosely flowered, pendulous, the flowers bracteate. Stamens 
5 to many, with short, glabrous filaments, the anthers often pilose.

both P. incana and P. tomentella by its obovate leaflets, these about 
2 cm. long, 8-10 mm. wide. Neg. 3386. Used to tan hides because 
of the considerable amount of tannin it contains (Herrera).

Branches elongate, bearing many short, densely leafy flowering 
branchlets, these somewhat resinous toward the tips; leaves lanceo- 
late or oblanceolate, long-cuneate to the base, rounded or short- 
acute at the apex, usually about 3.5 cm. long and 1 cm. wide, some- 
times twice as broad or even broader, finely glandular-serrulate from 
the base to the apex; flowers about 7 mm. wide, corymbose, few, on 
pedicels to 7 mm. long; calyx lobes acute, slightly pilose, especially 
marginally, rarely throughout; fruits solitary, densely brown- villous- 
tomentose, star-shaped at maturity, each of the 5 spreading carpels 
suggesting a somewhat one-sided, Napoleonic hat, 10 mm. long, 8 
mm. wide above; seeds 11 mm. long, the wing oblique at the base, 
7 mm. long. Perhaps more than one species, or at least variety, 
can be distinguished. K. oblonga R. & P., of Chile, may be the same, 
but typically it has larger leaves, less finely serrulate and more 
abruptly cuneate to a well defined petiole. An infusion of the bitter 
bark and leaves of the tree was used in the treatment of fevers 
(tercianas), according to Ruiz and Pa von. The wood, because of 
its toughness, according to Herrera, is a favorite one for walking 
sticks and for supports of the hanging bridges. The leaves furnish 
a black dye.

14. ALCHEMILLA L. 

Reference: Perry, Contr. Gray Herb. 84: 1-57. 1929. 

Perennials, sometimes shrubby, often prostrate, or rarely annual. 
Leaves usually palmately or pinnately lobed or parted, rarely all 
radical. Stipules mostly foliaceous, lobed or cleft and connate to 
form a sheath or, if membranous, all or mostly entire. Flowers axil- 
lary or terminal, often cymose, glomerulate. Hypanthium persistent, 
often bracteate. The Peruvian species are chiefly of the section 
Lachemilla, with 2 (3-4) stamens, opposite the sepals, the anthers 
extrorse, in contrast to Alchemilla sensu strict., with 4 (5) stamens, 
alternate with the sepals, the anthers introrse. The section Aphanes, 
annual, the single stamen with an extrorse anther, is represented by 
one species. Rothmaler, Repert. Sp. Nov. 42: 164-173. 1937, re- 
establishes these sections as genera, a procedure scarcely to be 
followed outside monographic work. This author himself calls 
attention to the interesting analogy between the sections and their 
ranges. I acknowledge my indebtedness to Rothmaler's studies in 
the section Lachemilla, particularly his Alchemillae Colombianae,

Plants pilose nearly throughout, rooting at the nodes, the stems 
several decimeters long; radical leaves more or less bipinnatifid, with 
conspicuous, brownish, cleft stipules; cauline leaves pinnatifid, the 
segments 3-5-dissected ; flowers glomerulate, the perianth 8-dentate,

natifid, 1.5-6 cm. long, the numerous pinnae usually imbricate and 
unequally divided; flowers solitary and axillary or terminal and 
glomerulate, distinctly pedicellate, villous to glabrate. Variable 
in pubescence. Forma argentea Rothm. is smaller and densely seri-

wanting; the basal leaves of the former have 2-3 pairs of leaflets, 
those of the latter are nearly pinnately parted. Since these two

Page 421 . In the treatment of the Olacaceae there were several 
unfortunate complications that necessitate some extensive additions 
and corrections to the family. The manuscript for the group was 
prepared several years before it was printed, although an attempt 
was made to check literature just before printing. Some of the 
recently described species had not yet been entered or at least filed 
in the Gray Herbarium card catalogue of new species, and somehow 
or other the appearance of the Olacaceae in the second edition of 
the Pflanzenfamilien escaped notice. It is necessary to present here 
a new key to the genera of the family, and a complete new treatment 
of the genus Heisteria. The writer is greatly obliged to Dr. H. 
Sleumer, who has kindly forwarded useful notes regarding the dis- 
position of the Peruvian species of Heisteria. Paul C. Standley. 

Stamens twice as many as the petals.

Page 422. Below is a new key to the Peruvian species of Heisteria, 
with an enumeration of them. The number of species here recognized 
is almost double that of the original treatment. The available material 
is much less than would be desirable for study, especially since some 
of the species seem to be rather vaguely limited. I have some doubt 



1128 FIELD MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BOTANY, VOL. XIII 

that all species listed here are valid ones, but it may be that ample 
material will show that the number of Peruvian forms is even greater.

Krukoff 8278, referred doubtfully by A. C. Smith to H. Spruceana. 



1130 FIELD MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BOTANY, VOL. XIII 

On page 424 of this Flora, Williams 3379 was placed incorrectly 
under H. densifrons Engler, a species not known to occur in Peru. 

Heisteria scandens Ducke, Archiv. Jard. Bot. Rio Jan. 4: 9. 
1925. H. eurycarpa Standl. Field Mus. Bot. 11: 148. 1936. 

A shrub or usually a large, woody vine; see the description on 
page 424. Known in Peru only from the single collection cited as the 
type of H. eurycarpa. Also in Amazonian Brazil. 

Heisteria Sleumeri Standl., sp. nov.

Loreto: Forest between Rio Nanay and Rio Napo, Williams 698 
(type in Herb. Field Mus.). 

Apparently a quite distinct species, noteworthy for the unusually 
numerous nerves of the exceptionally long and narrow leaves. Con- 
spicuous is the anastomosing of the lateral nerves to form an almost 
regular submarginal nerve. 

Heisteria Spruceana Engler in Mart. Fl. Bras. 12, pt. 2: 15. 1872. 

The description and citation of specimens (with very few excep- 
tions) for Heisteria cauliflora Smith on page 422 are referable to H. 
Spruceana, which occurs also in Amazonian Brazil. H. cauliflora, 
as limited by Sleumer, does not occur in Peru. A synonym of 
this species is H. Tessmanniana Sleumer, Notizbl. Bot. Gart. 
Berlin 12: 67. 1934, based on Tessmann 5060, from Iquitos. Dr. 
Sleumer writes that new Heisteria material from eastern Peru shows 
that the characters upon which it was separated from H. Spruceana 
do not hold.
