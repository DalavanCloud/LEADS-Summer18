Tribe CARDUEAE 
Cardueae Cass., J. Phys. Chim. Hist. Nat. Arts 88: 155. 1819. TYPE: Carduus L. 

Carlineae Cass., J. Phys. Chim. Hist. Nat. Arts 88: 152, 1819. TYPE: Carlina L. 
Centaureae Cass., J. Phys. Chim. Hist. Nat. Arts 88: 154. 1819. TYPE: Centaurea L. 
Echinopsideae Cass., J. Phys. Chim. Hist. Nat. Arts 88: 157. 1819. TYPE: Echinops L. 
Cynareae Less., Linnaea 5: 128. 1830. TYPE: Cynara L. 

Annual, biennial, or perennial herbs, rarely small shrubs; stems simple or branched, 
often spiny. Leaves alternate, usually pinnatifid or incised, rarely entire, the margins 
usually dentate, spinose, often densely tomentose or lanate. Capitula homogamous and 
discoid, the corolla lobes linear, equal to subequal, heterogamous and disciform or 
radiate, the marginal florets pistillate or neuter, the corollas ligulate or rarely 2-labiate, the 
inner florets with corollas tubular, deeply to shallowly 5-lobed, homochromous, yel- 
lowish or purplish, rarely white, the anthers basally sagittate or caudate, the auricles 
entire, irregularly lacinate, or marginally pinnatifid, the terminal appendages elongate, 
acute, the styles slightly thickened or with a ring of minute hairs near the point of 
bifurcation, the branches separate or connate, short, obtuse. Achenes terete or com- 
pressed, obovate, unbeaked, sometimes umbonate, mostly glabrous or sparsely covered 
with one-celled trichomes; pappus a crown a multiseriate bristles, rarely paleaceous, or of 
uniserate bristles or paleae fused basally. 

The Cardueae sensu lato includes approximately 80 genera, primarily Eur- 
asian, chiefly Mediterranean, and southwest to central Asia. Dittrich (1977) has 
proposed following Cassini's (1817, 1819) splitting of the tribe into presumably 
more natural units by removing the tribes Echinopsideae Cass. 1 (2 genera/ca. 120 
species) and Carlineae Cass. (11 genera/ca. 90 species) and recognizing two 
subtribes within the Cardueae, the Carduinae Dumort. (40 genera/ca. 1,700 
species) and the Centaureinae Dumort. (27 genera/ca. 813 species). While the 
delineation of natural taxonomic units is utilitarian, the fragmentation of an 
obviously monophyletic tribe seems unnecessary. 

The tribe is represented in Peru by three species, all native to the Old World 
and adventive weeds in the New World.

H. Gentry, principal investigator).

bifurcation, the branches linear. Achenes obovoid to oblong, compressed or tetragonal, 
glabrous or puberulent with unicellular trichomes of varying lengths, articulating later- 
ally; pappus persistent or rarely caducous, of 2 to several rows of scabrid to plumose setae, 
or oblong to linear squamellae, the inner longer. 

A genus of 500-600 species, primarily distributed in the Mediterranean re- 
gion and southwest Asia, with a few from tropical Africa and North and South 
America. In Peru only the following introduced weed has been collected. 

1. Centaurea melitensis L., Sp. PI. 917. 1753. TYPE: Europe, exact locality and 
collector unknown (LINN, holotype, not seen, IDC Microfiche 117. 619: III. 1). 

Annual or biennial herbs to 80 cm tall; stems erect, winged above, striate, arachnoid, 
crispate-puberulent. Lower leaves oblanceolate in outline, 10-15 cm long, 1.5-3.0 cm 
wide, lyrate-pinnatifid to sinuately lobed, apically obtuse, basally cuneate, the upper 
oblong to oblanceolate, 2-6 cm long, 0.5-2 cm wide, entire to irregularly undulate- 
dentate, decurrent on the stems, both sides green, crispate-puberulent, arachnoid, 
glandular-punctate. Inflorescences of solitary capitula at the tips of branchlets or weakly 
cymose. Capitula homogamous, discoid; involucres ovoid-globose, 8-12 mm wide, ca. 12 
mm high; outer phyllaries ovate, 4-8 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, glabrous to arachnoid- 
tomentose, scarious, indurate, stramineous, apically and marginally spinulose, squar- 
rose, the inner lance-ovate to lanceolate, 8-9 mm long, 1.5-2.0 mm wide, glabrous, scari- 
ous, stramineous, apically spinulose, all apices reddish; receptacles plane; corollas yel- 
low, tubular, ca. 1 cm long, glandular, 5-lobed, the lobes 1-2 mm long, linear. Achenes 
oblong, 2.5-3.0 mm long, puberulent to glabrate; pappus multiseriate, the outer of narrow 
squamellae, 0.4-1.6 mm long, the inner of elongate scabrid setae, ca. 3 mm long. Chromo- 
some numbers: n = 11, 12, 18. 

This species is a native of Europe and North Africa and is an adventive weed 
in North and South America. It occurs in a wide range of habitats throughout 
Peru, but most frequently in disturbed areas. No vernacular names have been 
recorded for this species in Peru; however, it is known as "abre puno amarillo" 
in Argentina and "cizana" in Chile.

Centaurea solstitialis L. is the only other member of this genus, with yellow 
corollas, known to occur in South America (Argentina), and it is easily distin- 
guished by its much larger involucral spines (10-25 mm long).

Basal leaves in a rosette, obovate, 10-50(-80) cm long, 5-15 cm wide, pinnatifid, glabrous 
or glabrescent, petiolate, the upper leaves sessile, auriculate-amplexicaul, spinescent. 
Inflorescences solitary. Capitula discoid; involucres globose, to 4 cm wide, 4-6 cm high; 
phyllaries basally ovate to lanceolate, widening abruptly to an ovate-subulate appendage 
distally, the outer 1-2 cm long, often lacking an appendage, the inner 4-5 cm long (in- 
cluding appendage), all ca. 1 cm wide, the margins and apices spinose, reflexed to erect; 
corollas ca. 30 mm long, the lobes ca. 6 mm long, linear. Achenes ovoid to obovoid, 6-8 
mm long; pappus 15-20 mm long. Chromosome number: n = 17. 

This species is widely distributed within Peru, primarily at elevations above 
3,000 m. It is known throughout Latin America by many vernacular names, 
including "cardo, cardo manchado, cardo mariano, cardo bianco, cardo santo," 
and in Peru as "cardo de la alamenda." 

Silybum marianum has been used in homoeopathic medicine in India, where 
its seeds are used in the control of hemorrhage, jaundice, cirrhosis of the liver, 
and related liver and gallstone conditions (Varma et al., 1980). At present, no 
record exists of this plant species being used medicinally in Peru.
