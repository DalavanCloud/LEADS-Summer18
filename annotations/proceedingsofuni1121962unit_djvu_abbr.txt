Publications of the Lnited States National Museum 

The scientific publications of the United States National Museum include two 
series, Proceedings of the United States National Museum and United States 
National Museum Bulletin. 

In these series are published original articles and monographs dealing with 
the collections and work of the Museum and setting forth newly acquired facts 
in the fields of anthropology, biology, geology, history, and technology. Copies 
of each publication are distributed to libraries and scientific organizations and 
to specialists and others interested in the various subjects. 

The Proceedings, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate 
form, of shorter papers. These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with 
the publication date of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume. 

In the Bulletin series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appear longer, 
separate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts) 
and volumes in which are collected works on related subjects. Bulletins are 
either octavo or quarto in size, depending on the needs of the presentation. 
Since 1902 papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum have been 
published in the Bulletin series under the heading Contributions from the United 
States National Herbarium.

LACE-BUG GENERA OF THE WORLD 
(HEMIPTERA: TINGIDAE) « 



By Carl J. Drake and Florence A. Ruhoff 



Introduction 



A treatise of the generic names of the family Tingidae from a global 
standpoint embodies problems similar to those frequently encountered 
in corresponding studies in other animal groups. The more im- 
portant criteria, including such basic desiderata as fixation of type 
species, synonyms, priority, and dates of technical publications 
implicate questions concomitant with recent trends toward the 
clarification and stabilization of zoological nomenclature. 

Zoogeography, predicated and authenticated on the generic level 
by the distribution of genera and species, is portrayed here by means 
of tables, charts, and maps of the tingifauna of the world. This 
visual pattern of distribution helps one to form a more vivid concept 
of the family and its hierarchic levels of subfamilies and genera. 
To a limited extent the data indicate distributional concentrations 
and probable centers of evolution and dispersal paths of genera. 
The phylogenetic relationship of genera is not discussed. 

The present treatise recognizes 216 genera (plus 79 synonyms, 
homonyms, and emendations) of the Tingidae of the world and gives

the figure of 1,767 as the approximate number of species now recog- 
nized. These figures, collated with similar categories in Lethierry 
and Severin (1896), show that there has been an increase of many 
genera and hundreds of species of Tingidae during the past three- 
quarters of a century. And as attested by the number of new forms 
being described each year in technical publications, there are still 
many unknown genera and many more new species yet to be dis- 
covered. 

The three subfamilies of the Tingidae are listed in alphabetic 
sequence. The genera and subgenera (including synonyms, homo- 
nyms, emendations, misapplied names, misspellings, nomina nuda 
(sine species), lapsus calami, and errata) are also alphabetized under 
their respective subfamilies. Although absolute completeness and 
perfection are unattainable, every effort has been taken to formulate 
a complete registery of all generic and subgeneric names, both 
valid and invalid, heretofore proposed in the literature for both 
existing and fossil tingids. Each reference has been checked against 
the original publication. Thus, a number of errors that have crept 
into the literature have been rectified. 

The authors hope that the users of this work will make known 
typographical, technical, and other errors so that corrections may 
be made in the catalog of the Tingidae of the world, now in 
preparation. 

Often it has been difficult to accredit with any degree of certainty 
the first authority accountable for synonymy, subsequent type desig- 
nation of a genus, and other taxonomic changes. When such in- 
formation was not so expressed in the literature, the oldest ascertain- 
able record of the action has been cited as the authoritative citation. 

Accepted or valid generic and subgeneric names are printed in 
boldface type; the invalid or inacceptable names are in lightface 
type. Cross-references are provided to link every synonym, homo- 
nym, emendation, unaccepted name, and error of any type to the 
proper taxon. 

The name of each genus, subgenus, and type species is followed by 
the name of author with date and page reference, thus providing 
identification in the list of literature cited. "Later citation" as used 
herein refers to authors who have correctly cited the type species after 
its fixation; a "previous selection" is a citation made prior to the 
official list of the International Commission on Zoological Nomen- 
clature but is in agreement with that list; "erroneous or invalid 
citations" are explained under the respective genera. 

In searching for new generic records and other taxonomic changes, 
the reader should begin with volume 93 of the Zoological Record 
(1956).

2 The 15th International Congress of Zoology (London, 1958) made provisos for the acceptance of family 
names originally founded in the vernacular— such as Tingidites Laporte (1833) in French— providing such 
usage has been generally accepted. Since Tingidae (for "Tingidites") meets the new code of Zoological 
Nomenclature, we are accrediting "Tingidae" to Laporte, who was the first to use a family name for the 
lace-bugs. It should be noted that all technical and vernacular names for the family always have been 
based upon the generic name of Tingis Fabricius.

Tingitides Puton, 1875, p. 28; 1899, p. 38. 
Tingidides Vollenhoven, 1878, p. 9. 

Type genus: Tingis Fabricius (1803, p. 224). 

The family Tingidae comprises a moderately large assemblage of 
insects ranging rarely more than 2-5 mm. in length. The spe- 
cies are entirely plant-feeders, and both adults and nymphs 
obtain food by sucking out the juices from the cells of the tissues 
within the living plants. At times they occur in sufficient numbers 
to constitute an important plant-pest. 

Adults and offspring live on the underside of the leaves of the host 
plants. Their presence soon betrays itself by the appearance of 
whitish and discolored spots on the upperside of the leaves just above 
the place of feeding. Many species are gregarious and both adults 
and nymphs cluster near the spot where the eggs were laid. The 
life-cycle is relatively short, two or more generations usually being 
passed during the growing season. Metamorphosis, called hemi- 
metabola, is gradual. 

Many different kinds of wild and cultivated plants serve as feeding 
and breeding hosts. Among the common economic hosts might be 
mentioned such plants as cotton, sugarcane, eggplant, cassava, rubber, 
pear, apple, cherry, avocado, almond, tea, coffee, banana, cacao, 
coconut, camphor, black pepper, and olive. Shade and forest trees, 
shrubs, herbs, grasses, and decorative plants also serve as primary 
hosts. Mosses, too, are inhabited. Members of three genera found 
in Africa, Australia, Asia, and southern Europe are typical gall- 
forming insects. Distribution, except for the lands of the Arctic and 
Antarctic Zones, is practically worldwide. 

As a familial group, tingids are separated from almost all other 
families 3 of the order Hemiptera by the intricate pattern of delicate 
lacework occurring all over the processes of the pronotum and of the 
fore pair of wings. On account of their lacy appearance, tingids are 
known globally by the same colloquial name, "lace-bugs," and once 
seen they are thus easily recognized. The immature stages are often 
adorned with long, plain or modified spines, only the adults being 
clothed with lacework in different specific patterns. 

The question is frequently asked, "What is the use or function, if 
any, of the lacy dorsal covering of tingids?" Perhaps it is for pro- 
tective concealment. For similar reasons man himself makes use of 
"nets" or "screens" of various kinds to conceal or camouflage stra- 
tegic objects from the eyes of enemies, especially from the air. Color 
and markings also enter into the picture. 



• Members of the hemipterous families Piesmatidae and Peloridiidae also have the dorsal surface of their 
bodies composed of lacework, but phylogenetically neither is very closely allied to Tingidae or to each other. 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 5 

In the subfamily Tinginae, members of many genera at times are 
said to "run wild" structurally in the development of unique and 
fanciful forms of specific designs in lacework. The pepper tingid 
(fig. 1) of the South Pacific is only one of hundreds of such creations. 
Many species in other genera are at least just as ornately clothed 
and befittingly decorated in singular lacy structures. There are no 
replicas nor facsimiles among species, because each species possesses 
its own form, pattern, and style of lacework. Both generic and 
specific characters used in the identification of lace-bugs are based 
largely upon lacy structures. Only with the aid of illustrations can 
such unequaled oddities of intricate lacework be described adequately 
for taxonomic studies.

Hemipterists are almost entirely of the opinion that the families 
Tingidae and Piesmatidae are not very closely related and thus 
together did not form a natural higher taxon. According to a recent 
paper by Drake and Davis (1958, p. 572), evidences from external 
morphology and reproductive organs of males and females of the two 
families do not substantiate the retention of the superfamily Tin- 
goidea for these families. Consequently, those authors suppressed the 
superfamily as then constituted. 

The myrmecophile family Vianaididae was erected by Kormilev 
(1955, p. 465-477) to hold a new genus and new species, Vianaida 
coleopterata Kormilev, and another monobasic genus, Anommotocoris 
minutissimus China (1945, pp. 126-128) described from Trinidad, 
British West Indies. As the families Tingidae and Vianaididae are 
without ventral trichobothria and both belong to the group Cimi- 
comorpha of Leston, Pendergrast, and Southwood (1954, pp. 91-94), 
Kormilev suggested that these two families may be consociates so as 
to form a superfamiry Tingidoidea (sensu novum). The relationship 
of these families and the status of the proposed superfamily "Tingi- 
doidea" (proper spelling should be Tingoidea) are now being critically 
studied and will be discussed in a subsequent paper dealing with the 
morphology and higher classification of Tingidae. 

Except for the characterization of many new genera and several 
hundred species, tingids have received scant attention for many 
decades in the taxonomic hierarchy of higher categories ascending 
from the generic to ordinal rank. Obviously the subfamilies and 
particularly some of the larger polytypic genera (Tingis, Leptopharsa, 
and Cysteochila, for examples) need more thorough analyses, both 
objectively and subjectively, from a worldwide aspect so that such 
heterogenous taxa can be better understood and especially delimited. 
Their constituents can then be more concretely tied into the generic 
concept of their respective type species. 

The progenitors and other pioneer genera at times have served as 
temporary repositories ("catch-alls") for many new species of doubtful 
or even unknown generic affinities ever since the days of Linnaeus and 
Fabricius. For example, the genera Phyllontocheila and Monanthia, 
both recently buried in synonynvy, formed generic anchors for the 
erection of a number of subgenera which have been withdrawn 
for elevation to the generic level. An examination of the specific 
names also reveals that more than 100 species of tingids originally 
described as Monanthia have been transferred to other, sometimes 
newly created, genera. Several genera now recognized as valid, such 
as Tingis, Cysteochila, and Leptopharsa, still hold some species of 
doubtful generic affinities. 

In the only catalog so far published on the Hemiptera (Heteroptera; 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 7 

Miridae not included) of the world, Lethierry and Severin (1896, 
pp. 4-26) recorded a total of only 50 genera and 317 species of Tingidae 
for all five continents and the islands of the seas. Forty years later, 
Drake and Poor (19.36a, p. 381) enumerated 52 genera from the 
Western Hemisphere alone. The latter authors also stated that 424 
species had been described from the Americas and estimated that 
approximately 1,100 species were then characterized in the world. 
Monte (1947) published a list (incomplete) of 99 tingid genera (in- 
cluding synonyms) and their respective type species for the world. 

Two basic and monumental treatises have been written on the 
family Tingidae. Horvath (1906c) published a very comprehensive 
stud} r of the Tingidae of the Palearctic subregion, with original keys 
to genera and species. He recognized 19 valid genera and 201 valid 
species for the Palearctic subregion. Hurd (1946) published descrip- 
tions and original keys to the 44 genera known to occur in North 
America. This author gave the figure 424 as the number of known 
species at that time inhabiting the Americas north of the Panama 
Canal. 

Inasmuch as the foregoing papers dealt with land areas of various 
extents, involving diverse biotic conditions and even overlapping 
fauna! regions, the data are too disparate to trace growth and to 
compare generic and specific populations in different faunal areas. 

In a lengthy paper dealing with the Rhynchota, Amyot (1845, 
pp. 369-492; 1846, pp. 73-192) proposed a monomial system to 
replace the binomial nomenclature as originally organized by Lin- 
naeus (1758). This new system, mononymy, would classify animals 
by means of a one-word taxon representing both genus and species in 
lieu of the binary system of two words, one for genus and the other for 
species. This monomial system of Amyot was never seriously con- 
sidered by entomologists, nor recognized in the Zoological Code. 

Under Division in, Membranientes, Amyot (1846, pp. 175-192) 
mononymized technical names for a number of species of tingids and 
piesmatids. In the transition from the binomial to the monomial 
system, he employed several well-known generic names and created 
a number of new monomial names. Only one of the mononymic taxa 
was created for a new tingid species, the others being erected for 
well-known species of that time. This mononymic species, "Dic- 
tyesthes," described by Amyot (1846, p. 181), has been cited by 
Garbiglietti (1869, p. 275) as Dictyonota dictyesthes Amyot. The 
publication of Garbiglietti (1869) validated D. dictyesthes as a specific 
name and thus credit of authorship must be given to Garbiglietti 
rather than to Amyot. 

In his "Nomenclator Zoologicus," Neave (1939-1950) wrongly 
included the monomial names of species named or renamed by 



8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM vol. hj 

Amyot as generic names and credited them to Amyot as such. This 
is a serious error. Since Amyot's names are not true generic names 
and have no nomenclatorial standing, they are not included herein in 
the present treatise of the generic names of Tingidae of the world. 
The authors hope that the above comments will prevent further 
confusion and use of these monomial names. 

In his catalog of the Hemiptera, Walker (1873, pp. 175-179) in- 
cluded only two families, Tingididae and Piesmidae, in the Mem- 
branacea, and divided a number of tingid genera into "Divisions" 
and "Subdivisions." For the new taxa below the generic level, 
Walker used a jumble of scientific names of other workers. These 
names were wrongly employed, wrongly synonymized, and wrongly 
classified by him. Since no new generic or subgeneric names are in- 
volved, the present authors are following previous catalogers and 
omitting Walker's names of generic and subgeneric divisions. 

The proper form of the family name of the lace-bugs was an item 
of contention for more than a century. The moot point of the con- 
troversy rested almost entirely upon finding the correct "root" and 
"stem" of the type generic term Tingis of Fabricius. These items 
have been amiably and consummately investigated by Holland (1922a; 
1922b; 1924), Baker (1922; 1923), Parshley (1922a; 1922b), and 
Schmitz (1935). Their findings showed much diversity of opinions 
and little unanimity as to the origin and status of " Tingis." 

In January 1923, Baker submitted to the International Commission 
of Zoological Nomenclature a concise summary of the findings and 
conclusions on the controversy of Holland, Parshley, and himself, 
including a request for a ruling on the origin and formation of the 
word "Tingis." To quote from Opinion 143 of the International 
Commission of Zoological Nomenclature (1943, pp. 83-85): 

Tingis dtant un nom latin dont le genitif est Tingis et l'accusatif Tingim, 
TINGIDAE est la forme correcte du nom de la famille. 

The ruling was: 

The family name for Tingis Fabricius, 1803 (Syst. Rhyng.: 124) in the Hemip- 
tera is TINGIDAE. 

Beginning with volume 59 (1922), the Zoological Record has con- 
tinually used the family name Tingidae for the lace-bugs. That 
spelling under the R6gles has been universally accepted as the proper 
family name for the lace-bug family. 

Stal (1873, p. 116) and Distant (1903c, pp. 122-145) both used the 
higher categories as divisions for the family Tingidae, although 
Distant placed a few genera in the wrong division. These categories 
were Cantacaderaria, Serenthiaria, and Tingidaria. Later, Distant 



LACE-BUG GENERA — DRAKE AND RUHOFF 9 

(1909, pp. 121-122) created two new divisions: Axiokersosaria, for 
the reception of Axiokersos ovalis Distant, from India; and Aidoneu- 
saria to hold Aidoneus dissimilis Distant. As the characters of these 
two new divisions will not always separate them from genera of the 
division Tingidaria, they are both synonymizcd here with Tinginae 
(olim Tingidaria) . 

Since Distant's (1903c) work titled "The Fauna of British India" 
is used so extensively in systematic studies, the present equivalent 
taxa for the above divisions are listed here: 

Cantacaderaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Cantacaderinae. 
Serenthiaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Agrammatinae. 
Tingidaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Tinginae. 
Axiokersosaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Tinginae. 
Aidoneusaria, synonymizcd with subfamily Tinginae. 

Blatchley (1926) subdivided the subfamily Tinginae into three new 
tribes for the reception of the genera occurring in eastern North 
America. The status of these tribes is discussed below in the order 
of their erection. 

Tribe Galeatini Blatchley (1926, p. 451) comprises the genera 
Galeatus, Corythuca (error for Coryihucha), Stephanitis, Leptobyrsa 
(not Stal), Corythaica, Dictyonota, Gargaphia, Gelchossa, Leptodiclya, 
and Acanthocheila. Gelchossa is a synonym of Leptopharsa (p. 58). 
Leptobyrsa is a South American genus not represented in the United 
States. As used by Blatchely (not Stal), Leptobyrsa is synonymous 
with Stephanitis, and thus Stephanitis blatchleyi Drake (1925b, p. 37) 
and S. rhododendri Horvath (1905, p. 567) were wrongly transferred by 
him from their original generic position to this genus. Galeatini is not 
applicable for the inclusion of some of the American genera as well 
as many related genera in the Old AVorld, and it is here suppressed 
as a synonym of the subfamily Tinginae (p. 31). 

The tribal name Acalyptini Blatchley (1926, p. 479) was established 
to hold the genera Acalypta and Drakella. As the latter is a synonym 
of the former, only Acalypta is left in the tribe. Acalyptini is not a 
valid tribe and thus is treated here as a synonym of Tinginae (p. 31). 

The tribal name Physatocheilini Blatchley (1926, p. 483) was 
established to include the genera Physatocheila, Dichocysta, Tingis, 
Teleonemia, and Leptoypha. The characters employed by Blatchley 
in his tribal descriptions and key couplets do not correspond to those 
of the genus Physatocheila itself, those of all the species of Teleonemia 
of South America; nor those of some genera found in insular America, 
South America, and the Old World. Thus, it becomes necessary 
here to synonymize the tribe Physatocheilini with Tinginae (p. 31).

Fossil Fornis 

Fossil records are too few to tell much about tingids in geologic 
time. The molds of the species that became entangled and engulfed 
in amber, both Baltic and Prussian, belong to existing genera, though 
specifically representing quite different species. Most of the petrified 
forms also belong to existing genera. Table 1 summarizes the distribu- 
tion of fossil species. There are 6 genera and 9 species, plus 4 species

determined only as u Tingis sp." The genera not represented by 
present-day species are mentioned below. 

Eotingis Scudder (1890, p. 359) was erected to hold antennata 
Scudder (p. 360, fig.) from the United States (Florissant, Colorado. 
Horizon, Oligocene) and Tingis quinquecarinata Germar and Berendt 
(1856, p. 23, figs.), found in Prussian amber. Since T. quinque- 
carinata is being transferred to the genus Cantacader of the subfamily 
Cantacaderinae, this now leaves Eotingis with the genotype as its 
only member. 

Cantacader quinquecarinatus (Germar & Berendt), new combination 

Tingis quinquecarinata Germar and Berendt, 1856, p. 23, fig. — Scudder, 1891, p. 449. 
Eotingis quinquecarinata Scudder, 1890, p. 359; 1891, p. 406. 

Scudder (1890, p. 359) wrongly transferred Tingis quinquecarinata 
Germar and Berendt to the genus Eotingis Scudder. The original 
description and the two fine illustrations of T. quinquecarinata show 
that species to be a typical member of the genus Cantacader Amyot 
and Serville, and it is herein transferred. 

For an unusual fossil found in southern Russia, Bekker-Migdisova 
(1953) created for its reception the name Tingiopsis reticulata in the 
family Tingidae. A study of the venation of the hemelytron of tbis 
fossil species shows that it does not fall into the classification of the
